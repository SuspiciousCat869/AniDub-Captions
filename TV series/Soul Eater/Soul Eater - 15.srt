[Kid]
A few days ago,

Don't be such a slacker...

67
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,708
Preliminary research
is necessary.

68
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,750
Which is what I would tell

hate this place too.

enough basic information.

Good... So then what's
our next destination?

than that, can't you?

00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,958
Why are we back
in this stupid rowboat?

78

Whatever we're going to do,

important, or else...!

Of course it is...

this hard for nothing?

So... what is this black
dragon thing we're after?

84
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,250
[Kid] This part of the Baltic
Sea is a key maritime area.

85
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,583
There has been a lot of
boat traffic out here...

86
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,541
Sailors have been crossing
these waters since

87
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,250
the Vikings first set sail.

88
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,291
Kay... but what
does that have to 

89
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,166
do with some scary
black dragon?

90
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,583
Not every boat
makes it to shore.

91
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,083
So, in an area where there
are many ships crossing...

92
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,583
That means there are also
a number of ships sinking.

93
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,375
Kid, I don't think I like
where this is heading...

94
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,208
[Kid] Just because a ship sinks
doesn't mean it'll stay sunk.

95
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,083
[Liz]
What is this?

96
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,000
[Patty]
A cloud!

97
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,166
[Kid]
It's mist.

98
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,541
[Liz] What kind of mist?

99
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
[Kid] We're getting close.
Stay sharp.

100

What?!

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,041
[Kid] I sense the presence of
countless numbers of

102
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,041
souls in this area.

103
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,083
[Liz]
So what does that mean?

104
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,125
[Liz cries out in panic]

105
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,500
[Kid] It means that's
the black dragon.

106
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,833
[Liz]
What is that thing?!

107
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,208
See that writing?

108
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,666
[Patty]
Ni... duh... hogg?

109
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,708
[Kid] Nidhogg is the name
of a black dragon that

110
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,583
appears in Norse Mythology.

111
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,708
According to the legend,
it's also the name of a

112
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,958
ghost ship that
haunts these waters...

113
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,583
Many people have believed
the legend to be true.

114
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,541
And now I can
see why they would.

115
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
Right...!
Ladies, let's go...

116

we're heading up there!

117
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,916
No, no way, not a chance.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,125
It's a ghost ship...!

119
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,916
Which means there're
gonna be ghosts on it!

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,375
[Patty]
Row!

121
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,166
Wait Patty...!

122
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,833
Patty! Patty! Patty! Patty!

123
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,666
[Kid] You idiot...I told you
to wait, didn't I?

124
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,666
[Patty giggles]

125
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,000
Whoopsie... sorry!

126
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,708
If you want to do
damage to the other ship,

127
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,541
you have to ram
them in the middle! 

128
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,750
[Patty]
Uh-oh.

129
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,750
You're mad cause she
didn't hit the middle?!

130
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,041
Now, do it again!

131
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,583
Oh-kay!

132
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,541

[Liz] You guys
are absolutely crazy.

136
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,250
Worse than crazy,
you're insane crazy jerks.

137
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,791
Insane, crazy jerks
with a death wish.

138
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,583
Oh no-oo...! I was so busy

139
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,791
focusing on their insanity
that I came on board.

140
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,833
I'm gonna die!

141
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,541
[Liz cries]

142
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,750
[Kid]
From what I'm sensing,

143
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,625
the souls are inside
the ship somewhere...

144
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,708
In we go.

145
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
Yay!

146
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,333
[Liz]
I've got a better idea:

147
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,750
how 'bout we don't?

148
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,541
There are ghosts hanging
around in there, remember...?

149
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,833
What if they eat us...?

150
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,541
Hey, guys, are
you listening to me...?

151
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,208
You guys!

152
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,250
[Kid]
Let's go, Liz.

153
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,583
[Captain laughs evilly]

154
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,833
A fresh batch of souls have
come to me all on their own!

155
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,208

They're just ahead.

Whatever someone
has planned, it isn't good.

160
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,583
Can we take all these
souls cause they

161
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,166
don't belong to anyone?

162

to become a Kishin...?

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,250
As a protector of souls,
I can't allow this.

164
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,625
I have to safeguard them.

165
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,500
What do
we have here...?

166
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,416
You're a grim reaper?

167
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
Liz... Patty!

168
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,041
Yeah, okay.

169
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,541
Okay!

170
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,916
Nid... hogg!

171
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,083
[Liz screams]

172
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,708
Liz wait!

173
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,250
[Patty giggles]

174
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,625
She fell...! She fell!

175
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,666
She's your sister!

176
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,291
How can you be
laughing like that?!

177
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,333
[Captain laughs]

178
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,291
This ship is my body,
and my body is this ship.

179
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,208
All I have to do
is digest the little lady.

180
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,125
[Kid]
Are you an evil spirit...?

181
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,625
What are you planning
to do with all these

182
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,625
human souls you've gathered?

183
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,625
[Captain] The meddlesome Lord
Death is making things more

184
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,000
difficult for me
than ever before...

185
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,041
That's why I'm going to present
these souls to the Kishin...

186
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,500
I'll certainly be
rewarded for that.

187
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,500
[Kid]
Kishin?

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,291
You mean the sword Ragnarok?

189
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,875
[Captain laughs]

190
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,708
That rookie doesn't have
anything to do with this...

191
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,125
No, no, I'm talking about

192
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,291
the Kishin who's
right next to you.

193
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,333
That's who I gathered
these souls for.

194
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,250
What's that...?

195
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,208
What do you mean next to us?

196
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,500
[Captain laughs]

197
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,166
It's nothing a child
like you would understand.

198
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,125
This ship and I have
things to do, people to see...

199
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,458
We're going places together,

200
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,375
me and this ship...

201
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,000
Somewhere at sea, far away...

202
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,041
people are waiting to
hear the song of the Kishin.

203
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,500
Most people are alike...

204
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,083
They all crave power
in one form or another...

205
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,208
but for some...

206
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,416
no amount of earthly power

207
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,375
will ever be
enough to satisfy...

208
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,083
They always hunger for more.

209
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,541
It's humans like these
who are seeking the Kishin...

210
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,291
and these souls
that you see here

211
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,083
are my own offering to it...

212
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,083
They're not for you, boy!

213
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,041
Hey, Kid...

214
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm gonna transform now.

215
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,458
No.

216
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,541
I can't.

217
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,208
I can't I can't
I can't I can't.

218
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,458
I can't do this!

219
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,208
[Liz]
Patty...! Kid...!

220
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,500
Where are you...?

221
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,000
I hope the ghosts
haven't eaten you!

222
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,541
Kid won't be able to
use Patty without me.

223
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,666
It would be asymmetrical.

224
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,625
He'd get a nosebleed
and pass out.

225
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,500
There's no way they'll
be able to fight whatever's

226
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,750
on this creepy ship...

227
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,333
I have to get back
to them quickly.

228
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,958
Okay... I'm not the
least bit frightened!

229
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,125
No way is this ghost
ship scary to me!

230
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,041
I'm one of the Thompson sisters,

231
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,708
the legendary devils of
Brooklyn nobody wants to

232
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,583
run into in a dark alley...! 

233
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,250
Nothing frightens me...!

234
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,166
Nothing!

235
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,166
[Liz panics]

236
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,666
What am I doing on this ship?

237
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,458
How did this happen to me?!

238
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,416
Just our luck that we went
and mugged a grim reaper...

239
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,208
Life isn't fair!

240
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,375
Where am I going?

241
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,583
Is this even the right way?

242
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,166
[Girl]
Yes it is... This way.

243
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,000
[Liz]
(oh) Hey, thanks.

244
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,250
That's very nice of you.

245
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,125
Who said that?!

246
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,416
I'm just hearing
things, that's all.

247
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,458
[Girl]
You're doing well...

248
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,291
Just keep coming
straight this way.

249
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,708
I won't look. I won't look.
I won't look. I won't look.

250
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,041
If I don't look, she'll go away.

251
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,125
No one's there. No one's there.

252
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,041
No one's there.

253
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh please, let no one be there!

254
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,333
I won't look. 

255
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,625
[Girl] Come on...
just a little further this way.

256
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,916
I'm the spirit of a girl
who was eaten by this ship...

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,083
Don't worry,
I'm not going to hurt you.

258
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:37,791
I'm not dumb.

259
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:38,666
I know how ghosts work.

260
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,833
You were eaten, and now you're

261
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:40,875
angry and restless
and you want revenge.

262
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,208
So you're gonna eat me!

263
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,416
I don't have any
reason to eat you...

264
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,041
I only want to help you...

265
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,250
If you'll just follow me,

266
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,833
I can take you back
to your friends, okay?

267
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,833
I can see through you!

268
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,708
You're lying!

269
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,833
You want gobble up my hot body!

270
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,666
No, I'm not going to eat you...

271
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,833
You just have to trust me.

272
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,125
I might have big boobs,
but I'm all skin and bones!

273
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,541
Just trust me.

274
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,666
I'd be stringy and tough
and not tasty at all, I promise.

275
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,833
Just trust me.

276
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,583
[Liz cries out]

277
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,125
Okay, that's enough...

278
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,583
Quit your childish blathering
and follow me right now...!

279
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,750
Or I'll spank you to death!

280
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,666
Yes ma'am...
I'll follow you anywhere.

281
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,541
I'm glad we got
that straightened out...

282
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,208
Now get moving.

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,375
[Girl]
For crying out loud,

284
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,916
I don't see what you have
to be so upset about anyway!

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,291
I didn't even get to live

286
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,000
long enough to have
a hot body like you.

287
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh yeah...

288
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,916
I'm sorry I rubbed
it in, really.

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,208
Patty... your big sis
ain't doin' so well.

290
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,458
Running away won't do any good.

291
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,250
[Kid thinks] I partnered with
these two specifically so

292
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,208
something like
this wouldn't happen.

293
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,791
I need symmetry...!

294
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,750
Maybe I should have
listened to my father!

295
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,250
He tried to pick out
a good weapon for me...

296
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,708
But I refused to listen to him.

297
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,375
Stubborn!

298
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,458
All I cared about...

299
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,000
All I wanted...

300
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,250
Was symmetry...!

301
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,083
Two symmetrical weapons!

302
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,541
Was that so much to ask for?!

303
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,125
And now all my efforts...

304
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,625
Have been completely...
and utterly... wasted!

305
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,041
Damn it!

306
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,458
Where did Liz go?

307
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,250
Hey... This way...

308
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:50,458
Come this way... La...dy.

309
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,208
--This way, Lady....
--Quit screaming, you big baby!

310
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,458
--Come this way...
--Quit screaming, you big baby! 

311
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,666
--I'm too young to die!
--Follow the arrows.

312
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,000
--Please don't make
me come with you!

313
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,375
[Captain] What's
the matter, boy...?

314
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,208
Shouldn't a grim reaper
have more power than this?

315
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,583
You haven't seen
what I can do yet!

316
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,125
Then why not
show me something...?

317
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,125
Are you frightened,
reaper boy...?

318
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,666
I worship the Kishin,
your sworn enemy.

319
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,000
And I steal the souls
of innocent people.

320
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,333
This is the perfect chance

321
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,791
to pass judgment on
what you call evil.

322
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,250
[Kid]
I do not deny evil,

323
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,708
nor do I believe that any

324
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,208
human is completely
free of malice.

325
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,500
Everything must be in balance.

326
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,375
As long as evil and good
maintain an equilibrium 

327
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,458
in this world,
there is no problem...

328
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:32,416
Perfect balance is
the key to everything.

329
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,666
Who cares about the
ideals of some stupid kid?

330
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,875
Don't think for one second

331
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,708
that all humans feel
the same way you do!

332
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,583
I don't care if
they do or not...!

333
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,791
I'm going to keep fighting

334
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,833
until this world is
the way it should be...

335
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,083
Until the world is balanced.

336
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,083
Really...? Even if that
means taking away freedom?

337
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,333
[Kid]
You disgust me!

338
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,458
I am a grim reaper...

339
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,666
I refuse to grant anyone
the freedom to kill.

340

[Ghosts]
Come this way...

341
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,333
come this way...

342
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,916
This is the way.

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,458
Here we are.

344
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,791
Thanks a lot for all your help.

[Liz] We're up
on deck, all right...

346
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,250
...but I don't see anybody else.

347
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,083
I knew it!
I was right all along!

348
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,583
You are going to eat me.

349
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,375
You're going to simmer me
in a pot with onions and garlic

350
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,333
and have me for dinner!

351
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,333
They're coming right now.

352
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,625
Stop crying or
I will smack you!

353

Oh, hi Sis!

354

[Kid]
Hey there Liz...

355
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,375
Nice of you to show up...!

356
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,458
You idiot! Because of you,

357
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,291
I couldn't use Patty,
you know that!

358
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,500
It's not my fault
that you're crazy.

359
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,333
You're... back...!!

360
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,041
Patty!

361
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,833
I missed you so much!

You aren't goin' to get away.

Finally.

365
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,416
Now that we're all
back together,

366
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,833
we can take care of business.

O'Kay!

370
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,375
Yeah. Okay.

371
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,416
Time to die.

372
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,958
What was that?

373
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,125
The sword.

374
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,750
Ragnarok.

This can't be possible!

He devoured all
of the human souls.

410

I have a question for you...

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,291
Tell me... can you really fly?

Why do you ask that?

know, it's more like floating.
