ordinary indeed...

161
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,666
Go on, try sticking your
hand in the water.

162
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,708
[Black Star] All right, but I'm

163
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,041
still a little iffy
about this jar.

164
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,833
[Soul]
What was that?!

165
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,541
I knew that jar was dangerous.

166
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,291
[Stein]
No, it's just the water.

167
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,500
You might want to start off

168
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,708
by sticking in only
one finger at a time.

169
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,625
All I have to do is get
to where I can withstand

170
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,166
putting my whole
hand in there...

171
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,458
and then I can use Tsubaki's
Enchanted Sword mode, Professor?

172
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,333
That's the basic idea.

173
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,916
That'll be a nice break...

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,916
All I've been doing lately
is muscle conditioning,

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,333
and it's gettin old.

176
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,333
What's with you?

177
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,375
It isn't fair.

178
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,583
How can you get stronger

179
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,500
just by playing with
a jar filled with water?

180
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,958
Hah! Isn't it obvious?

181
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,250
I'm Black Star...

182
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,958
I'm on a whole different
level than you.

183
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:51,875
I'm a big man.

184
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,083
I've beaten Death!

185
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,666
Who else can say that?

186
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,375
No fair...! Professor Stein,

187
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,833
can I have one of
those special jars too,?

188
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,583
[Stein]
I can't do that.

189
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,541
The water in the jar is
only intended to help

190
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,166
Black Star be able to use
Tsubaki's Enchanted Sword mode. 

191
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,375
[Black Star] I'm not gonna let
myself get beaten by a jar.

192
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,333
I don't care how special it is!

193
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,541
[Stein] I'd be surprised if
Black Star even realized

194
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,500
what he was doing by
saying things like that...

195
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,666
By talking constantly about
what a star he is

196
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,250
and how 'big' he is,

197
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,750
Black Star is actually driving
himself without even meaning to.

198
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,500
[Maka]
Driving himself?

199
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,666
[Stein]
Yes.

200
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,166
"There's no stage
too big for me.

201
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,541
Of course I can do it!"...

202
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,625
That's his answer to
any challenge he faces.

203
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,916
And once he's said that,

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,125
he will put every effort
into making it happen,

205
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,875
because he's already
decided he will succeed.

206
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,791
Black Star is trying
to surpass death.

207
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,833
He is bound to become stronger.

208
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,125
Right.

209
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,166
But that's his way
of making himself stronger.

210
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,708
It's not a method that
will work for everybody...

211
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,250
You have to find your
own way to do it,

212
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,541
something that works for you.

213
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
My own way of
becoming stronger.

214
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,958
Right now you're definitely
lacking something, Maka.

215
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,500
A certain level of stress and
anxiety is understandable.

216
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,125
But you don't want
to take it too far. 

217
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,291
Wait, what do you
mean 'lacking something'? 

218
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,666
Once you figure
out what it is,

219
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,583
come see me and we'll
decide what to do about it.

220
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,708
Didn't I tell you to start out
with only one finger.

221
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,041
You can take
the jar with you...

222
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,958
The lesson's over for now.

223
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:16,833
[Blair]
Hey, Maka...

224
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,875
What about the party?

225
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,416
[Maka]
Oh yeah! I almost forgot.

226
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,625
I was gonna throw a
party to congratulate Tsubaki

227
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,125
and Black Star
since they finally

228
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,500
managed to collect a soul...

229
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,125
and to celebrate the
fact that Soul's coming home.

230
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,833
Be sure to have some
good fish dishes, okay?

231
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,458
He's strong, huh?

232
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,416
Medusa] Okay, Soul...
I expect to see you

233
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,375
back here in one week.

234
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,958
[knocking at door]

235
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,625
Excuse me.

236
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,041
Hey.

237
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,708
I'm going home to get
ready for the party.

238
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,375
See you there.

239
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,666
Something does seem to be
bothering her. Is it the scar?

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,666
Yeah, that happens
every time she sees it.

241
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,166
She gets this pained look.

242
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,541
Well it may not've been tasty,
but it sure was filling.

243
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,041
Hey, I've got an idea...

244
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,791
Next time you do the cooking.

245
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,125
Don't listen to him, Maka.

246
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,250
It was delicious.

247
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,541
Yum...! Yum!

248
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,916
Yeah, thank you
for the snacks.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,166
You guys have
a nice place here.

250
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,333
It's so tidy...

251
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,958
You must make a
point of keeping it clean.

252
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,625
It helps that Maka yells
at me whenever

253
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,875
I make a mess.

254
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,083
Is it just the two of
you living here, then?

255
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,166
[Blair] Yoo-hoo! Is everyone
having a good time?

256
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,791
Which one of you little boys
wants to come and

257
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,166
take a bath with me?

258
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,500
The water's nice and warm.

259
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,833
Is it always like
this over here?

260
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,708
Oh yeah... Anybody want
to take the sexy kitty home?

261
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,166
She's free.

262
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,250
[Medusa thinking] Infiltrating
the academy was worth the risk.

263
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,416
I'll need to run some tests
on Soul now that he has

264
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,583
Ragnarok's black
blood inside him.

265
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,333
With this key,
it should be easy.

266
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,750
[Medusa]
Well...

267
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,708
What a coincidence
running into you here.

268
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,250
[Eruka] Have you already guessed
what we're doing here, Medusa?

269
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,000
Or should I tell you?

270
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,166
Oh, please... tell me.

271
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,208
Ribbit-ribbit...

272
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,666
All right then, I will...

273
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,250
We've come here to kill you.

274
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,875
Oh no! But that's terrible...!

275
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,541
I thought we were friends.

276
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,833
Don't take it personally.

277
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,291
We simply have no interest

278
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,500
in attracting the attention
of the Grim Reaper...

279
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,000
...and we don't
care for whatever

280
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,666
little experiments you're
doing at the academy either...

281
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,916
You're now a liability Medusa.

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,541
[Medusa] And
liabilities must be killed.

283
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,125
Before you do that, though...

284
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,541
may I offer you a
little piece of advice?

285
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,500
That outfit is
a liability, too...

286
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,458
It simply screams 'witch.'

287
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,000
Whether you're casting
Soul Protect or not,

288
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,916
there are a good number of
young meisters wandering

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,708
these streets, who know
a witch when they see one.

290
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,208
[Eruka] Sweet of you to warn us,
but don't you worry...

291
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,708
If it comes to it,
we can use our

292
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,666
transformation
magic to escape...

293
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,625
...which is a luxury
you don't have.

294
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,958
I see now...

295
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,458
So that's how you're
planning to beat me, is it?

296
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,750
We know we couldn't beat

297
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,166
you in a fight under
ordinary circumstances...

298
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,583
But here in Death City you need

299
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,333
to maintain your
cover as a school nurse.

300
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,833
You can't drop your Soul Protect

301
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,750
and use magic
to defend yourself.

302
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,500
That would be a dead giveaway. 

303
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,666
You're cornered.

304
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,083
All we have to do is attack you

305
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,666
while you're
using Soul Protect...

306
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,166
If you don't fight back,
we'll defeat you easily.

307
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,666
And if you do release your
Soul Protect to attack us,

308
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,708
we'll transform and
make a clean escape.

309
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,416
Meanwhile, you'll be revealed
to the meisters as a witch

310
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,083
and they'll hunt you down.

311
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,333
Whatever you decide
to do, we still win.

312
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,458
Not a bad plan,
wouldn't you say...?

313
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,583
And that's how the

314
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,166
frog and mouse will
beat the snake...

315
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,791
Tonight you'll be the
one croaking, not me...

316
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,708
Funny how the world works.

317
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,083
If you're going to kill me,

318
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,583
please don't make me
listen to your bad jokes first.

319
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,541
That's just plain cruel.

320
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:18,833
Soul Protect... release. 

321
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,000
You're finished...

322
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,041
Say goodbye, now.

323
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,291
That soul wavelength... 

324
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,375
Witch.

325
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,291
What's up Maka?

326
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,250
You startled us.

327
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,416
It's two witches...

328
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,291
What are they
doing in Death City?

329
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,000
Sorry guys. I'll be right back.

330
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey Maka, what gives?

331
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,458
I would love nothing more

332
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,208
than to hear your screams
as you're writhing in agony.

333
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,666
But I'm afraid we don't
have time for that...

334
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,166
How unfortunate.

335
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,916
[Medusa] You do have the
brains of a frog and a mouse.

336
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,041
Only stupid creatures would
try to defeat me this way.

337
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,958
You will be punished.

338
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:07,125
Too bad you aren't even fit
to serve as research subjects.

339
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,750
If you're going to fight
all we have to do is run.

340
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,333
What is she waiting for...?

341
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,875
Why isn't she releasing
her Soul Protect?

342
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,458
Wait a second...!

343
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,833
Where are the tattoos that
were on your shoulder?

344
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,875
Oh my... They seem to have
disappeared, haven't they?

345
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,333
[Mizune makes
"chee chee" noises]

346
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,500
Mizune what's wrong?

347
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,625
The snakes...!

348
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,416
You put them
inside of Mizune's body?!

349
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,708
There's no way...

350
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,083
When could you have--

351
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,208
You did it last night.

352
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,833
I have thousands of snakes
stored in my body waiting

353
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,708
to do whatever I say.

354
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:49,250
Those are only a few of them.

355
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,083
Mizune!

356
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,083
My snakes will consume her
until there's nothing left.

357
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,750
But how could you?

358
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,875
The snakes are magic too,
aren't they...?

359
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,875
And you haven't
released your Soul Protect...!

360
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,666
So how are you...?

361
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,000
[Medusa] These little ones
have magic of their own...

362
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,375
I don't have to release my
Soul Protect to use them.

363
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,708
This one's my pride and joy...

364
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,791
She's such an obedient
and effective little darling.

365
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,750
An impressive trick...

366
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,250
Wouldn't you say?

367
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,208
[Medusa] You must
realize by now...

368
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,500
Mizune isn't the only one my
darlings have slithered inside. 

369
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,041
R-R Ribbit.

370
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,916
[footfalls]

371
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,291
[Eruka Frog runs off crying]

372
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,208
[Medusa]
That didn't take long...

373
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,291
Stein.

374
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,416
And Maka.

375
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,333
Are you all right Dr. Medusa?

376
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,416
We detected two witches
in this area and came

377
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,958
as quickly as we could.

378
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,750
Yes... I sensed them too and

379
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,333
came here to investigate
them myself.

380
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,041
I wonder if one of them
could have been the witch

381
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,000
who was there when
Soul was injured.

382
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,833
That is a possibility.

383
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,375
[Stein] No, I don't think
it's the same one.

384
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,750
For one thing, that witch had

385
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,833
the Demon Sword and its
meister along with her.

386
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,041
And even if she had been here,

387
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,708
I doubt we would
have sensed her at all...

388
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,333
I have a feeling that this one
is too cunning to release her

389
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,666
Protect in the middle of
Death City without reason. 

390
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,708
One thing we do know
is that this witch has an

391
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,625
interest in weapons
and meisters...

392
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,041
...so I wouldn't be surprised
if she was in the area,

393
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,875
observing the students here.

394
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:30,208
But I have no doubt she
would want to do it quietly.

395
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,583
Yes...

396
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,375
I suppose it's even possible
that she has managed to

397
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,500
infiltrate the academy itself...

398
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,291
But that would be tricky,
even for a powerful witch.

399
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,250
Whatever the case,
it's a relief that you weren't

400
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,541
hurt by these witches,
Dr. Medusa...

401
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,000
We would be in some serious

402
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,375
trouble if anything happened
to our only school nurse.

403
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,791
[Medusa]
Thanks, but I'm fine.

404
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,416
But still... If I...

405
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,291
...ever see that sword
and its meister again...

406
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,291
[Maka thinks] I don't know how
much longer I can handle this...

407
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,833
I know I promised myself
I'd become stronger, but...

408
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,875
[footfalls]

409
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,125
[Soul]
Maka!

410
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,583
Are you all right, Maka...?

411
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,916
You shouldn't take
off on your own.

412
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,791
It's too dangerous!

413
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,583
I'm fine, Soul.

414
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,041
Hmm?

415
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,375
[Maka thinks]
I couldn't do it...

416
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,416
I couldn't bring myself
to look at Soul's scar.

417
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,625
I have to find a way
to face this scar...

418
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,750
I can't let Soul get
hurt like that again.

419
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,916
I refuse to let my
fear control me anymore.

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,875
You have to tell me
what's going on.

421
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,583
All right, Professor Stein.

422
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,041
Yes?

423
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
I know...
what I'm lacking now.

424
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,666
You told me to
figure it out, and I have.

425
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,041
Very good.

426
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,916
[Stein thinks]
At last...

427
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,750
Maka's finally found the
courage to fight her fear.

428
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,166
[Stein] In that case,
I'd like you and Soul

429
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,458
to come to my office
tomorrow for a special lesson.

430

[boing boing boing]

431
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,791
I've come far enough.

432
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,000
I should be able
to rest a bit now.

433
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,250
Next time I really am

434
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,708
going to kill you,
Medusa. Ribbit!

435
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,166
Ah, yes...

436
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,041
That feels nice and
cool on my foot.

437
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,416
I could get used to this.

438
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,625
[Eruka Frog]
That's her isn't it?

439
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,375
I thought I was safe.

440
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,458
There's just one tiny favor
I need to ask of you, Eruka.

441
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,125
[Eruka]
A key?

442
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,458
I don't understand.

443
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,291
How did you know where I was?

444
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,250
The snakes inside you told me...

445
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,666
It doesn't matter
how far you run.

446
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,291
From now on,
I'll know wherever you go.

447
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,708
[Medusa]
Now about that favor...

448
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,375
There's a man I'd like you
to release using that key.

449
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,166
His witch prison
number is thirteen.

450
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,708
Unless you're
a very stupid frog,

451
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,708
I'm sure you know
who I'm talking about.

452
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,166
[Eruka] You don't mean the
man with the Magic Eye?!

453
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,166
But, he's the one who

454
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,875
took the
Grandwitch's left eye...!

455
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:23,583
If I free him I'll be banished
from the witch world forever!

456
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,458
No...!

457
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,041
They'll probably just kill me!

458
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,875
[Medusa] I can kill you right
here if you'd prefer.

459
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,916
[Eruka]
Ribbit! Fine! I'll do it.

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,541
There's a little experiment

461
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,416
I'm going to do using the
man with the magic eye...

462
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,375
Some questions I have
concerning Soul Eater.

463
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,041
You're going to use
him for an experiment...?!

464
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,541
What are you thinking...?

465
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,666
You're out of your mind...!
Ribbit.

466
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
You don't feel as
good on my foot now...

467
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,166
Change yourself
back into a frog.

468
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,250
[Eruka]
O...kay.

469
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:08,166
[Prisoner A] Plus two plus one
plus two plus one plus two...

470

He's at it again...

471
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
That's getting so annoying.

472
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,500
What is the answer?

473
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,333
How many times did I multiply?

474
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:25,333
One plus two plus
one plus two plus one...

475
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,625
