00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,666
I'm way too cool
for extra lessons.

164
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,375
[Death] Do you remember your
duty as meisters and weapons?

165
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,375
Yes... Our duty as meisters

166
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,375
is to feed our
weapons 99 Kishin souls

167
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,666
and one witch's soul...

168
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
We collect evil souls in

169
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,458
order to keep
the world at peace...

170
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,208
We work to
create a Death Scythe...

171
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,125
...weapon of the
Grim Reaper, Death.

172
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,666
[Death]
You are absolutely right!

173
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,541
But do you know how
many souls all of you

174
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,500
have managed to collect?

175
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,375
Exactly zero!

176
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,416
[Death] It isn't something to
laugh about, Chuckles...

177
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,666
Anyway, are you ready to

178
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,875
learn what your extra
lessons will entail...?

179
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,125
Maybe you've already
heard the rumors.

180
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,458
About Sid...

181
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,083
Who taught here at the
academy until recently...

182
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,291
[Soul]
See...? I was right...

183
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,875
It wasn't just a story.

184
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,791
Yeah... But a zombie?

185
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,000
I always thought he was
a really good teacher.

186
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:38,833
[Death]
You're right...

187
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,041
When he was alive,

188
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,125
he was regarded as an
excellent teacher...

189
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,541
But when he became
a zombie, he changed...

190
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,541
He has been released
from the fear of death...

191
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,750
...and now he wants others to
have the same freedom he does.

192
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,125
He is trying to train students
to free themselves as well,

193
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,083
but when a student
won't listen, Sid attacks.

194
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,416
Another difficulty is that
we still don't know who

195
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,166
changed Sid into a zombie...

196
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,625
or what their motive
could possibly have been.

197
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,375
Okay...! You can leave
it all to me sir!

198
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,458
For our extra lesson,

199
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,125
we just have to
eliminate these guys?

200
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,666
[Death] Yup,
that's pretty much it.

201
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,791
Now, I don't want to
put too much pressure on you...

202
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,958
but if you happen to
fail at these extra lessons.

203
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,208
Then you're all
going to be expelled.

204
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,041
[All]
What...?!

205
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,916
You're gonna kick us out?!

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,458
There's nothin'
to worry about...

207
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,333
I can take care of guys
like this in my sleep.

208
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:36,916
Come out...!

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,416
Nap time's over, zombie!

210
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,375
[Black Star] Hey, Tsubaki...
this is Sid's grave, isn't it?

211
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,583
Sure this is where we
want to start looking...?

212
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,958
Don't zombies get up
and move around a lot?

213
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,791
Might as well check this
place first to be

214
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,666
sure he isn't here.

215
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,250
I'm not gonna let myself

216
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,750
get expelled over some
walking dead guy.

217
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,458
It looks like an ordinary
grave stone to me.

218
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,208
[Soul] I never even listened
to your lessons. So there!

219
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,666
Soul seems...
a bit disturbed.

220
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,916
[Maka] I always thought
I was a great scythe meister

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,333
like my mother was...

222
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,375
How can I suddenly
be expelled?

223
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,458
What's up with Maka?
She seems kinda down.

224
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,875
Black Star, aren't you at least
a little worried about all this?

225
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,000
Where the hell are you hiding?!

226
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,291
Hey Soul, why don't we
go piss on Sid's grave?

227
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,458
What d'ya think about that?

228
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,583
Yeah, and while we're at it,

229
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,166
why don't we take
a dump on it too?

230
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,541
--Come on, Zombie!
--Get out here! 

231
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,083
We're gonna
beat you to a pulp!

232
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,958
You're just afraid to fight me
'cause I'm bigger than you.

233
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,416
--What? Are you too
scared to fight us?

234
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,375
You're hiding cause you're
a little coward, I know it.

235
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,208
Everybody knows it!

236
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,958
I think you can stop now...

237
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,958
Maka!

238
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,000
Are you scared, girl?

239
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,708
[Sid]
I think you are.

240
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,708
That's what Sid's become?

241
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,166
[Soul]
Guess so.

242
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,958
[Sid]
Maka... Soul...

243
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,125
Black Star... Tsubaki...

244
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,833
Good morning.

245
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:09,416
Good afternoon. Good night.

246
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,875
How have you been and all that?

247
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,541
I always tried to
remember my manners.

248
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,083
That's the kind of man I was.

249
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,333
Tsubaki, let's get ready
to end this guy.

250
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,791
Right.

251
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,916
[Death]
And so it begins.

252
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,666
[Maka] Tell me Sid...
why are you doing this?

253
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,666
Ding... dong...

254
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,125
dong... ding...

255
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,083
Being a zombie's amazing...

256
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,583
there are so many more
things I can get away with now.

257
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,291
Class is in session...

258
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,541
I always was a man to

259
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,000
start class right
with the bell...

260
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,458
Punctuality is important.

261
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,666
[Black Star]
This'll be fun.

262
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,083
I get to teach you
a lesson now, teacher...

263
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,416
And since it's
coming from me,

264
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,250
you know it'll be a big one!

265
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,666
[Soul] We don't want
to be expelled...

266
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,125
so we'll take your extra lesson.

267
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,625
But I gotta say,
I don't know what we're

268
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,041
gonna learn from a
decaying piece of flesh.

269
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,625
If you become a zombie...

270
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,833
...then death no longer
looms over you...

271
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,333
You can escape from
fear and be free.

272
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,125
That's wrong and
you know it...

273
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,041
You were never the type
of man who would say that!

274
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,958
You'll understand
when you're dead!

275
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,416
Black Star!

276
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,250
There'll be no need to
thank me for the lesson...

277
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,666
It's on the house.

278
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,291
I never was the 
kind of man...

279
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,958
to hold back!

280
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,916
[Sid] I'd recommend
you just give up...

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,750
You one-star meisters don't
have a chance of beating me.

282
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,958
I'm hungry.

283
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,916
Can we just get his damn
zombie soul already?

284
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,708
Sid's right.

285
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,333
He is very strong.

286
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,083
One star meisters like us
can't compete with him...

287
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,250
When he was alive,

288
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,875
he was designated a
three star meister.

289
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,041
[Soul]
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

290
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,500
Hey, Sid...! If you keep

291
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,083
swinging your tombstone
around like that,

292
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,833
you might bang it into
your fat head and die again.

293
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,291
[Sid]
It's my tombstone...

294
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,041
I can use it
however I want, can't I?

295
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,250
Now then, kids...

296
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,791
It's time for second period.

297
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,666
Ding... dong...

298
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,000
dong... ding...

299
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,458
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention:

300
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,166
when this lesson is over...

301
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,333
You're all gonna die.

302
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,750
Then I guess we'll be
cutting class today...

303
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,708
...think I'll go home and
take a nice, hot bath...

304
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,500
[duck quacking]

305
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,375
This is so boring.

306
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,625
[Blair] Maybe I should
take some classes, too.

307
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,291
I bet Maka and Soul are
having lots of fun right now.

308
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,250
[Sid]
What's wrong?

309
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,125
Why aren't you
working together?

310
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,875
You have to establish a
connection between the

311
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,500
souls of weapon and meister.

312
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,375
[Black Star] You're giving
advice to the enemy?!

313
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,083
I've always been
an enthusiastic educator.

314
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,458
[Sid] That's the kind
of man I was!

315
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,625
And now I'll
teach you how to die.

316
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,416
The Living End!

317
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,125
[explosion]

318
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,791
Black Star!

319
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,041
[Maka thinks] Sid was
a knife-meister...

320
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,791
But even without his blade,
the way he fights,

321
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,708
that tombstone
is all he needs...

322
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,666
So this...

323
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,250
...is a three star meister.

324
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,250
Ding... dong...

325
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,666
Dong... ding...

326
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,875
Looks like class is over.

327
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,500
Ready to die yet, girl?

328
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,833
Well, what do you say...?

329
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,708
Aren't you afraid of dying?

330
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,083
If you become a zombie

331
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,250
then you'll be free from
that fear of death forever.

332
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,666
[Black Star]
My head is killing me...

333
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,666
Your preaching is starting to
give me a headache,

334
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,875
you damn zombie.

335
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not listening to
any lesson of yours...

336
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,750
It doesn't matter
what you say...

337
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,833
Who's gonna pay attention
to a rotting corpse like you...

338
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,625
As long as there's
a big star like me around!

339
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,833
Being a three-star
meister doesn't matter.

340
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,458
I am...

341
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,666
...Black... Star!

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,250
[Sid thinks] He aimed for
the solar plexus,

343
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,041
the weakest point in
the center of the body.

344
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,791
[Death]
That was a nice attack...

345
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,000
As one would expect from a
dark assassin like Black Star.

346
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,250
[Black Star]
Tsubaki-- Shuriken Mode!

347
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,708
[Tsubaki]
Right!

348
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,708
You can't run away!

349
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,583
As if I'd even try!

350
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,541
[Soul]
Maka... He's coming.

351
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,916
The Living... End!

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,416
[explosion]

353
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,375
[Sid laughs]

354
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
What the--

355
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,000
[Sid thinks] She avoided it with
such a narrow margin for error.

356
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,541
People need fear to survive.

357
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,500
We experience it so
that we can grow stronger!

358
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,958
[Death]
Hmm?

359
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,291
[Death]
If she wasn't afraid

360
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,208
in this situation I'd
call that reckless...

361
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,291
But Maka has the courage
to fight in spite of her fear...

362
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,916
[Soul]
Maka.

363
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,250
Let's do what he said...

364
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,666
See if you can match
my soul's wavelength.

365
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,833
But that hasn't worked
for us a single time before.

366
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,541
So what...

367
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,875
This is us. We can do it.

368
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,500
Let's go! Soul Resonance!

369
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,291
[Maka and Soul power up]

370
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,166
The legendary super skill
of the scythe meister!

371
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,458
Witch Hunter!

372
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,666
[Maka]
No!!

373
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,541
You trying to kill us...?

374
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,666
What the hell, Maka?!

375
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,500
Nice...!
This is all your fault...!

376
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,791
Do it right, idiot!

377
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,333
[Soul] What? You've
gotta be kidding me!

378
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,750
Why is this my fault...?!

379
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,208
You're the idiot here,
getting mad at me for nothing...

380
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,250
Die!

381
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,750
[Maka] Die?!
How can you say that?!

382
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,000
--[Maka] You die!
--That was incredible power.

383
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,166
[Soul]
Cry baby!

384
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,083
I wanted to do it
without a super skill.

385
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,750
I just wanted to do
things the simple way!

386
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,208
[Maka]
Huh?

387
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,250
He's gone.

388
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,458
[Soul] No...
he's hiding underground.

389
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,375
[Maka]
He's down there?

390
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,625
[Sid yells out]

391
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,708
[Soul] Damn...! He dodged
our attack again!

392
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,250
Now, Black Star.

393
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,041
[Black Star]
Yeah... I got it.

394
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,416
[Black Star]
What Sid's doing now

395
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,833
is using the first of
the assassin's rules.

396
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,833
[Tsubaki] Dissolve in the
darkness and erase your breath.

397
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:58,500
Wait for an opening
to attack your target.

398
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,958
[Black Star]
Tsubaki.

399
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,958
Let's get a step
ahead of this guy.

400
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,416
[Tsubaki]
Right.

401
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,708
[Black Star]
You zombie bastard...

402
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,375
You're not going to upstage
me in this performance.

403
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,625
[Maka thinks] Black
Star's movements

404
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,583
seem different from usual.

405
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,708
[Black Star thinks] Only one man
is gonna die in this graveyard.

406
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,791
And it's not gonna be me.

407
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,458
[Black Star]
Trap Star.

408
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,333
[Black Star]
Assassin's Rule Number Two:

409
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,791
Concentrate on the target...

410
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,958
If I listen carefully,

411
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,000
I can hear his
soul's wavelength.

412
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,291
I can pick it
up through Tsubaki.

413
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,458
[Maka thinks] His
breathing stopped.

414
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,958
[Death]
And now...

415
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,041
[Black Star]
Trap Star activate!

416
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,833
I think that it's about time
to send you back to the grave...

417
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,500
You really stink.

418
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,708
What are you doing,

419
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,333
tying me up along
with this guy?!

420
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,625
I wouldn't have to if
you didn't get in my way.

421
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,583
--[Soul] Hey, let us outta here.
--[Death] So far so good...

422
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,833
Maybe it's time to
take a break from this.

423
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,250
[Kid] So now they just have
to find the person who turned

424
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,833
Sid into a zombie, right?

425
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,250
[Death]
That's right.

426
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,708
Who's responsible...?

427
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,375
Do you know?

428
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,541
He's no ordinary enemy, is he?

429
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,041
[Death] You're familiar with
my current weapon, right...?

430
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,083
Death Scythe...?

431
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,333
And I assume that you have

432
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,750
at least heard of the
meister who trained him.

433
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,833
[Kid]
Yeah...

434
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,750
It was Maka's
mother, wasn't it...?

435
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,041
What about her?

436
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,958
[Death] Actually...
that's not quite right...

437
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,625
Maka's mother was
Death Scythe's second partner...

438
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,125
He had another.

439
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,208
So that means...

440
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,250
This person was his first?

441
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,041
[Death] Yes. The man behind
this is Dr. Franken Stein.

442
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,958
And not only was he
Death Scythe's first partner...

443
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,458
He was also unquestionably

444
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,500
the greatest meister to ever
graduate from the academy.

445
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,500
[Stein] Can't seem to get
my head on straight.

446
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,083
I give up.

447
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,958
Too tired.

448
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,208
He's here.

449
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:56,416
♪ closing song ♪
 

450
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,833
[Maka] In the dead of night,
when even the plants are asleep,

451
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,416
a cry echoes out in
a patchwork laboratory...

452
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,083
[Tsubaki] Fear.
Shrieks. Splatter.

453
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,958
The horror that appeared
before these innocent young

454
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,333
boys and girls was Franken--

455
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,833
[Maka] Whoa,
whoa, wait, Tsubaki!

456
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,541
You gotta build the
mood a little more!

457
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,208
[Tsubaki] Sorry. I guess
I'm not very good

458
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,041
at this sort of thing...

459
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:38,916
[Maka]
Sure you are.

460
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,125
C'mon, just give it a try...

461
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,708
[Tsubaki]
"oooo! I curse you!"

462
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,041
[Maka]
That was good...

463
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,791
[Tsubaki] On the next
episode of Soul Eater...

464
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,916
Shape of the Soul

465
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,166
~Enter the Ultimate
Meister, Stein?~

466
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,958
[Maka]
Watch it...

467
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,083
...or I'll take your soul!
