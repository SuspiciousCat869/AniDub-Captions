1
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,035
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,245
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:50,040
...and a sound body.

4
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,061
I have come...

5
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:13,271
...to strike a bargain.

6
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,235
♪ opening song ♪

7
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:04,341
She's here...

8
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,302
Even with her
Soul Protect on I can tell...

9
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:09,888
That's her behind this door...

10
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:12,098
Medusa.

11
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:14,809
Is someone there?

12
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:16,353
I'm so thirsty...

13
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:19,230
Maybe I could have
a glass of water?

14
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,940
That witch.

15
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,530
Medusa!

16
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:28,573
Oh!

17
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,450
There's a little
girl at the door...!

18
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,786
Is there something
I can do for you?

19
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,788
You did this!

20
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,290
I don't understand
what you mean...

21
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:38,958
Whatever did I do?

22
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,753
It's because of you that
Crona's suffering so much!

23
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:44,923
Oh my, so Crona's
a friend of yours...?

24
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,133
Tell me, how's he doing?

25
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,677
How do you think he's doing?!

26
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,679
Used like this
by his own mother!

27
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,764
Oh, I've been
very worried about him.

28
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,934
He's always been
such a fragile child, you see.

29
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:57,435
How could you do
this to him...?!

30
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,854
You call yourself a parent?!

31
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:02,440
Do you think I
could see Crona...?

32
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:06,736
A mother shouldn't be separated
from her child for so long.

33
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,321
Would you drop the act?

34
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,490
Of course...
I'm not sure how he'll react...

35
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:13,118
...seeing me in such a
sad state as this.

36
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,119
I told you...!

37
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,829
Drop the act.

38
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,124
Calm down, Maka.
Breathe.

39
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,291
Let's get outta here...

40
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,168
It's useless anyway...

41
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:25,422
Talking to someone like her
won't get you anywhere...

42
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,090
Do you hear me, Medusa...?

43
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:28,341
You're going to spend
the rest of your

44
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,385
life in that dark
little cell...!

45
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,054
Enjoy. It's more
than you deserve...

46
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:35,765
Come on.

47
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,110
Sorry, children...

48
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:50,572
...but I'm afraid it's not
going to end like this.

49
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,240
Don't you agree?

50
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,701
Professor Stein.

51
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:06,921
The Cards are Cut
o~Medusa Surrenders to the DWMA?

52
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:08,923
Yeah...

53
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,800
Now that was a
bit of a shock, huh?

54
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,470
We were all convinced
that Medusa was dead...

55
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:17,349
...and then she waltzes up to
the academy and surrenders?

56
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,018
It's my fault.

57
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,021
I was certain that Stein
and I had finished

58
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,232
her off for good
in that battle.

59
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:28,943
Don't forget we're
dealing with a witch here...

60
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:31,446
With them, anything's possible.

61
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,782
And that's just the beginning.

62
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,577
Medusa's no ordinary witch...

63
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,206
We can't handle her
using ordinary means.

64
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,585
Why did you come here?

65
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,046
To see you, of course.

66
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,339
Did you think they'd
let you walk out

67
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,883
of here whenever you want?

68
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,803
The world has begun
to move, Stein...

69
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:58,682
You feel it...
I know you do.

70
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:00,058
Besides, you know I'd never

71
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,061
bet on something I wasn't
guaranteed to win.

72
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,562
We'll see, won't we?

73
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,023
Are you feeling
all right, Stein...?

74
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:10,360
Your voice is
trembling a little bit.

75
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:11,653
I can hardly bear this...

76
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:15,281
...watching as the madness
slowly consumes you.

77
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:18,284
Don't you have other things
to worry about right now?

78
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,078
How could I not be worried...?

79
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,789
I need you.

80
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,958
Are you ready to join me?

81
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,585
You aren't telling the whole
truth... You must have had

82
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,296
another motive besides
talking to me.

83
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,882
You have to learn to free
yourself from the rules...

84
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,677
Otherwise, you'll
never be saved.

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,721
Come over to my side...

86
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,639
Together, we'll make
things happen.

87
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,975
We'll see the dawn
of a new world.

88
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,894
It's time, Stein...

89
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:47,313
You know that, don't you?

90
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,233
I...

91
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:51,359
Terribly sorry...

92
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,361
Am I interrupting...?

93
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,322
Get out of here, Stein...

94
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,908
You know you shouldn't
leave your lab right now.

95
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,126
You're coming with me...

96
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,627
Let's go.

97
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,884
Now where are you taking me?

98
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,971
Let me guess: to an
interrogation room...?

99
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,890
Well? Am I right?

100
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,768
Please, Mister...!

101
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,895
Why am I all tied
up like this...?

102
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,898
My arms hurt,
and I can barely breathe!

103
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,149
Give it up...

104
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,942
I'm not fallin' for it.

105
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,527
Oh...?

106
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,654
You talked to me though,
didn't you...?

107
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,824
So I won that round.

108
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:43,161
Pretty soon you're going to
be the one doing the talking.

109
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:52,837
Now then...

110
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,547
...shall we get started?

111
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,633
Torture's a bad idea.

112
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,010
Oh you can do it, of course...

113
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,512
...but you should think
carefully before

114
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,264
hurting my body...
or didn't you realize

115
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,725
that this body was borrowed?

116
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,102
Damn her.

117
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,521
She's thought of
everything, hasn't she?

118
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,609
As a parent, you should
show some sympathy...

119
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,861
That child deserves
her body back.

120
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:19,239
I only need it until my
magic fully recovers.

121
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,450
It's a loan... I'll give
it back sometime.

122
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,994
Just when we thought
you couldn't sink lower...

123
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:28,331
You might want to be more
careful in how you speak to me.

124
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,041
You don't even know what
I've come here to offer.

125
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,210
I could be the saving
grace you need.

126
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:33,545
Oh, yeah?

127
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:34,629
I have certain...

128
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:35,839
...information...

129
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,550
...that could prove
useful to the academy.

130
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,051
Information?

131
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:42,429
Take me to the Reaper,
and we'll talk.

132
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,139
Otherwise, you get nothing.

133
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,515
Don't be ridiculous...!

134
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,768
You aren't in a position
to make demands!

135
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,938
Anyway, you aren't
exactly trustworthy...

136
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,357
Why should we believe
anything you have to say?

137
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,693
I was afraid it
would come to this.

138
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,737
If that's your attitude,

139
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,322
I suppose I'll just have
to make you believe.

140
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:13,376
I was good with a shovel
back when I was alive, too...

141
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,170
I was that kind of man.

142
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,422
I don't mind all the digging,

143
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:20,008
but what could Medusa
be hiding here?

144
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,149
This looks like...

145
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:37,859
Brew!

146
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,494
We ran all the tests...

147
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,121
This is the real Brew.

148
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:54,042
She gave it to you in order to
convince you to let her
speak with me directly?

149
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,669
She's insisting on it...

150
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:58,380
Apparently, she wants
to make a deal with us.

151
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,590
A deal, huh?

152
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:03,635
I've got no damn clue what
that witch has up her sleeve...

153
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:07,097
Why is she willing to give
up Brew to us this easily?

154
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,015
And how did she
get her hands on it?

155
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,935
There's a lot about this
we don't understand.

156
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,186
I don't know what she's up to...

157
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,021
...but one thing we
can count on...

158
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,399
...she wants to use us somehow.

159
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,401
I'm sure of that.

160
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,194
At any rate...

161
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,487
...she's right.

162
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,781
I do think I should
speak with her in person.

163
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,282
Are you sure?

164
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,701
Yes...

165
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:30,745
I want you to bring
her here immediately.

166
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:36,084
Sooo...

167
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,503
Grim Reaper.

168
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,005
Ya ya...

169
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:42,257
...you're enjoying yourself
immensely, aren't you?

170
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,094
Because of you, the world is now
on the brink of total disaster.

171
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,178
That may be true...

172
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:48,680
...but I'd still like
to show you my

173
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:50,890
gratitude for speaking with me.

174
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,393
Let's get to the point.

175
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:55,270
First, there's the matter
of these restraints.

176
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,355
Perhaps you
could remove them...?

177
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,024
They are quite uncomfortable...

178
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,734
...and surely with you
standing right there,

179
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,444
they aren't really necessary.

180
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,945
Don't play with me...

181
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,447
If you wanted those
restraints off,

182
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,199
you could have removed them
yourself a long time ago.

183
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:11,202
But it would be meaningless
if I took them off myself.

184
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:16,791
Don't try anything...

185
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,627
I won't think twice
about ripping you apart.

186
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:27,344
Reaper... Chop!

187
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,180
Um, Lord Death, sir...

188
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,598
Ah, come on.

189
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:34,642
After all she's done,
she deserved at least one chop.

190
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:35,310
Chop...!
Chop...!

191
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,062
The Reaper Chop...!

192
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:40,106
That's the thing I hated
most about the academy!

193
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,691
Even when I was
the school nurse,

194
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:45,236
I lived in fear of that
chop... It's awful!

195
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,405
Come here.
Now...

196
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,532
...what deal were
you talking about?

197
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,534
My bloomers are showing.

198
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:53,536
He's treating
me like a child...!

199
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,413
I miscalculated.

200
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:59,250
Excuse me, Reaper...
Could you put me down?

201
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:02,253
Bloomers!
Adorable!

202
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,881
My Maka wore those
when she was little...

203
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:07,759
So sweet!
Little baby bloomers!

204
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,761
This is getting too weird...

205
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:12,722
I need to get them to
focus somehow.

206
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:16,309
Now, if we could return to the
topic we were discussing...

207
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,852
Here's a question:

208
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,854
what do you think bloomers would
look like on a grown woman?

209
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,189
It's been done...

210
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:25,110
Centuries ago, they used
to wear them all the time.

211
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,612
But if they did it now,
wouldn't it be a bit creepy?

212
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:31,032
A philosophical discussion
on women's underwear?!

213
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,326
That's enough...!
Stop it right now!

214
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,577
Oh...!

215
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,705
We shouldn't talk about
this in front of a lady.

216
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,165
That's not what
I'm concerned about!

217
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,166
Right...

218
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,584
Now, about this deal of yours...

219
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,336
Put me down right now!

220
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,422
The little bloomers again!

221
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,259
If you don't stop that,
I am going to kill you.

222
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:50,301
What's her problem?

223
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:51,886
Can't she even
take a little joke?

224
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,930
And it was expertly
executed, too...

225
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,307
Repetition is the
foundation of humor.

226
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,684
Three times is best.

227
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,394
Absolutely.
I agree.

228
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:00,937
However, since we
were interrupted,

229
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,897
we'll have to start from
the beginning now.

230
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,275
Hey, where do you
think you're going?!

231
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,152
Oh...!
Come back.

232
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:10,030
I won't pick you up
by the hood anymore.

233
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,866
Is that a promise?

234
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,784
What do you say, Reaper?

235
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,703
The conditions of
the deal are fair...

236
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,079
If anything,
I think you're getting

237
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,622
the better end of the bargain.

238
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,791
What I'm offering is the
answer to the question

239
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,294
weighing heaviest on
your mind right now.

240
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:27,672
We won't agree to a thing
until we hear your conditions.

241
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:33,970
Fine. If you
don't want to tell us,

242
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,638
I'll pick you up by
the hood again.

243
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,640
Hey, you promised!

244
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,517
Sweet, adorable bloomers!

245
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,686
Would you quit that already?!
It's creepy...!

246
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,854
Just put me down...

247
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:46,232
I'll explain the deal...!
But let me go!

248
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,860
You honestly call
yourselves adults?

249
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,239
As for what I have to offer...

250
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,451
...will the Kishin's
location do?

251
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,912
You're lying...!

252
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,538
We've put all of our effort
into finding him...

253
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:03,166
...and we haven't
uncovered a single trace!

254
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:04,834
Death Scythe has
a point there...

255
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,836
How can we be
sure you aren't lying?

256
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,672
Can you prove
what you say is true?

257
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,507
No I can't.

258
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,968
At least, not while I still
don't have your complete trust.

259
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,220
Is that so?

260
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,180
All right, then give
us the location...

261
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,182
We'll check and
see if it's true.

262
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,060
You can't really think I'd
be stupid enough to do that.

263
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,186
Why not?

264
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,646
If I tell...

265
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,482
...what's your incentive to
keep your end of the deal?

266
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,401
What is our end of the deal?

267
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:31,403
It's not that
complicated, really...

268
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:34,531
I want to be released from
academy custody immediately...

269
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:37,992
I also expect you to guarantee
my safety, of course.

270
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,245
That's all you want?

271
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,789
Yes...
That's all of it.

272
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,583
Unfortunately, I
don't believe that's

273
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,086
a condition we can accept.

274
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,421
That's too bad...

275
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,381
I suppose this means you'd
rather live under the

276
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,551
thumb of Arachnophobia
than let little ol' me go.

277
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:55,552
What's this?

278
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:56,803
What d'you mean by that... ?

279
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,555
Are you saying that
Arachnophobia

280
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:01,266
and the Kishin are
working together?!

281
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,518
You'll know soon enough,
won't you?

282
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,119
It's all right...

283
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:24,914
As long as I'm here,
nothing can hurt you.

284
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,586
And I won't ever
leave your side.

285
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,257
I'll stay here and protect
you from everything you fear...

286
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,926
I promise, I will keep you safe.

287
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,929
Rest easy.
It's all right.

288
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:45,018
Mosquito.

289
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:47,562
Yes.

290
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,065
Activating Moral Manipulation...

291
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,983
...right now.

292
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,244
What's that?

293
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,913
It looks like it's begun.

294
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:47,956
What's happening?

295
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,542
What's begun...?
Please explain.

296
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,380
Arachne has allied
herself with Asura.

297
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:56,923
She's harnessed his madness...

298
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,552
...and she hopes to spread
it throughout the entire world.

299
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,387
Well, this is too bad
for you, Medusa...

300
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,181
Thanks to this, it looks
like the bargain's off.

301
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,808
Really?
Why?

302
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,394
The madness wavelength
he's giving off's huge...

303
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,272
Locating the source of it
won't be difficult at all.

304
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:13,565
I'm afraid you're wrong...

305
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,108
That would be impossible.

306
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,234
Why is that?

307
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,403
Arachne has set up
those relay stations

308
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,405
to bounce the wavelength
all over the world.

309
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:21,740
There's no way to tell for sure

310
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,533
which one of them is
the ultimate source.

311
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:25,535
You can investigate
them one by one...

312
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,663
...but unless you get lucky,
you'll be too late.

313
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,459
You've heard my
conditions, Reaper...

314
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,337
What now...?
Do we have a deal?

315
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:38,673
I'll need a moment...

316
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,718
There's a lot in this deal
I have to consider.

317
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,018
It's clear what Medusa
is trying to do...

318
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,021
She wants to instigate a
battle between her two rivals:

319
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,357
Arachnophobia and the DWMA...

320
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,983
She knows that if that happens,

321
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,402
all I can do is sit here
and watch the fight...

322
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:01,571
I can't leave Death City.

323
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:04,407
That sounds like something
she'd plan, all right.

324
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,617
Whatever the case...

325
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,911
...if we let things
stand as they are now,

326
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,330
it would mean disaster.

327
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:13,291
So what are we supposed to do?

328
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,711
That's what I'm
trying to decide.

329
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,090
Do we use her information
to wipe out Asura and Arachne

330
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:21,800
both at the same time?

331
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,260
Or do we take this
opportunity to eliminate

332
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,596
Medusa once and for all?

333
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,392
It's going to be okay...

334
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:33,853
They'd be insane to turn
down the offer I just made them.

335
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,609
It's a simple decision...

336
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:41,111
I've won...

337
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,821
I know it.

338
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:49,953
But if I'm wrong...
what will they do?

339
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,836
They're here.

340
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,184
Medusa.

341
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,317
You're free to go.

342
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,488
Why's she here?

343
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,907
What does the
academy want with her?

344
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,160
What's happening...?
Something wrong?

345
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:32,620
Come here, Maka...

346
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,039
Of all people,
I think you should

347
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,249
see what's happening
down there.

348
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,877
You'll understand.

349
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,420
Um...
Excuse me...

350
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:42,088
Coming through, please.

351
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,428
Medusa?!

352
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:51,431
Hey... what the
hell's going on here?

353
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:52,974
I don't know the details.

354
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,392
But right now...

355
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,062
...it seems the academy has
made a deal with Medusa.

356
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:58,646
But why?

357
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:02,650
That's something I'd be
very interested to know too.

358
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,529
Don't worry about it, Maka.

359
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,323
This isn't the last
we'll see of her...

360
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,367
We still have plenty of time.

361
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,659
Just wait for it...

362
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,787
I'm going to beat the
crap out of her.

363
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,455
And you'll get your
chance at her too...

364
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,874
I'll let you land
one on her face!

365
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:57,122
A deal?!
What is my dad thinking?

366
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:08,341
Why? Why are
they letting her go...?

367
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:09,926
It's wrong!

368
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:14,264
Well done...
Well done, Reaper...

369
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:18,101
You and your academy
are now my pawns.

370
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:37,120
Stein!

371
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:38,705
What...?

372
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,915
Are you sitting
here in the dark?

373
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,713
Stein?

374
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,684
Stein?!

375
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:06,316
Stein!

376
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:16,409
And on that night...
Professor Stein disappeared.

377
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:21,790
♪ closing song  ♪

378
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,878
Professor!
Where are you, Professor?!

379
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,379
Quick quiz...

380
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,174
Here's the first question...
where is Professor Stein...?

381
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:56,134
A.
Out buying groceries...?

382
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,303
B.
Getting drinks with my dad...?

383
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,804
Or C.
On vacation.

384
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,306
Uhh...
C!

385
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,058
Correct...!
So in the next episode,

386
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,976
everything will be
back to normal again.

387
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,644
You're lying.

388
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:08,146
Yes, Of course I am.

389
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,065
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

390
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,485
Twirl Round and 'Round... A New
World in Which The Doc Dances?

391
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,237
Watch it...
or I'll take your soul!
