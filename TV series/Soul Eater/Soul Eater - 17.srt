[Ox] In a quiet shrine nestled
in a land to the north,

7
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,458
sits a legendary Holy Sword

8
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,125
awaiting the arrival
of its next master.

9
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,791
The legend of this
Holy Sword extends back

through all of living memory...

11
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,625
It waits... sleeping silently
throughout the years.

12
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,000
He who draws the
Holy Sword from the ground

13
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,833
will be deemed a hero
and shall receive everlasting

[battle sounds as Ox speaks] He

Adorned with wings of light,

he shall stride
through the skies...

18
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,000
With a single swing he
shall cut through space itself. 

19
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,250
He who draws the sword
is a true warrior, cutting down

00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,541
all those who
stand in opposition.

21
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,791
But forget not,
that all of his greatness

22
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,166
and triumph shall be brought
about by the Holy Sword.

For all eternity shall the

be remembered,
exalted, and honored...

The Holy Sword... Excalibur!

Oh, no, I'm not a fool.

42
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,791
You see, I'm at the top
of my class at the DWMA.

43
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,125
I really am quite intelligent--

[Excalibur]
Fool!

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,333
No, I'm telling you
I'm not a fool.

46
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,500
My legend dates back to
the twelfth century, you see.

47
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,541
[Ox] Oh...

48
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,708
[Excalibur] My
legend is quite old.

49
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,583
The twelfth century
was a long time ago.

50
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you want to
hear my heroic tale?

51
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,083
Yes, of course I do.

52
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,125
That's why I came
here in the first--

53
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,875
[Excalibur]
Fool!

54
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,041
[Excalibur] Now then,
if you are to be my associate,

55
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,375
there are one thousand
provisions you must observe...

56
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,416
You will need to peruse these
before we begin our partnership.

57
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,083
[Ox] I'm sorry, but could
you tell me in what way

58
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,375
I'm being a fool?

59
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,208
Fool...! You have no
need for that information.

60
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,041
Oh... If you say so.

61
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,250
[Excalibur]
My morning always begins

62
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,125
with a cup of
coffee with cream...

63
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,666
Do you know why?

64
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,833
Uh, no, why do they--?

65
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:58,666

66
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,041
Listen, boy...!

67
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,041
My morning begins with
a cup of coffee with cream.

68
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,541
[Excalibur] Nothing beats a cup
of herbal tea in the morning.

69
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,000
Thus, every morning
I begin my day with a

70
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,666
cup of coffee with cream.

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,541
[Ox] But you just said nothing
beats a cup of herbal--

72
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,708
This is the first of the
one thousand provisions.

73
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,875
My mornings always begin
with a cup of coffee with cream.

74
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,083
Don't forget it!

75
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,416
But... as I just pointed out,

76
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,833
you said nothing
beats a cup of tea--

77
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,833
Here... I want to
show you something.

78
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,166
So these people...

79
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,875
Er... are they your... family?

80
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,916
The woman
standing next to you...

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,125
Don't tell me she's your--

82
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,250
[Excalibur]
Of course they're my family...

83
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,458
Isn't it obvious...?

84
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,666
And a wonderful
family they were.

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,375

[Excalibur]
It happened long ago...

88
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:03,041
when I was still in
the flower of my youth.

[uptempo beat music]

90

The cities began to grow wild...

91
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,208
People lost hope
for the future...

92
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,250
They became lazy,
idle time-wasters.

93

[yelling and fighting]

94
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,583

And, to my everlasting shame...

95
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,625
I was no exception.

96
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,958
Someday...
I'll have enough money

97
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,875
saved to leave
this city for good.

98
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,750
Thus...I began to watch
the seven o'clock news

99
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,791
religiously every night.

100
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,708
I see...So that pretty girl I
saw in the picture was your---

101
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,958
Fool...! That has
nothing to do with it!

102
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,125
Uh... Then what does
it have to do with?

103
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:04,958
Honestly...!

104
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,541
You don't get it at all.

105
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,875
What am I not getting?

106
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,333
Number fifty-eight of the
one thousand provisions

107
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,833
I would like you to observe...

108
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,750
Never talk to me while I'm
humming to myself.

109
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,125
This is an important provision.

110
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,625
Do you understand?

111
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,583
Uh, I can't help but notice
that your stories and these

112
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,750
provisions don't really seem

113
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,083
connected in
any significant way--

114
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,333
Fool! Humming and the
nightly news share a

115
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,250
very tight connection indeed!

116
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,666
But... from what you
just told me about

117
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,958
your past, I thought---

118
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,166
A symphony cannot be
created using common sense

119
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,750
and probabilities!
It is already written

120
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,333
in the fate of the composer...!

121
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,791
No, that's not it...

122
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,708
A symphony is the inevitable
result of a bad childhood,

123
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,208
deafness, and too many beans

124
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,000
eaten after a
certain time of day.

125

[Ox]
Obviously.

126
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,458
Thus, I found myself
carrying the fate of the

127
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,875
entire troupe as I performed
my dance before a

128

at the opera house.

hang out and enjoy each

139
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,666
It's peaceful, don't you think?

That may hafta change.

I can't stand out
if it's peaceful

142
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,416
I'll just have to shake

[Tsubaki]
Yes... What is it? 

146
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Have you finished writing
that report we were

147
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,333
assigned in class last week yet?

148
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,458
You mean you still
haven't finished it...?

149
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,750
You should hurry...

150
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,416
Isn't it due tomorrow?

151
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Yeah, I know...

152
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,250
but it is that
kind of report, so...

153
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,458
Oh, it's that kind, huh?

154
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,166
Do you think you could help me,

One must take time to think...!

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,208
Rushing forward without
considering things beforehand

164
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,166
is the height of foolishness.

165
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,208
Ah, yes, that reminds me of

166
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,375
another time when
I had to consider things...

167
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,750
That case was long ago,
but I remember it still.

168
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,500
[bell tolls]

169
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,375
[Excalibur] It was back when
I still hung my hat on

170
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,500
Baker Street and
called it home.

171
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,958
[Watson] Holmes have you
deduced anything yet?

172
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,166
[Holmes] Of course
I have, Watson.

173
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,416
It appears the perpetrator's

174
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,333
depravity is equal
to his stupidity,

175
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,458
based upon the elementary

176
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,041
trick he has seen
fit to employ here.

177
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,000
[Watson]
Elementary?!

178
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,041
But we're stumped.

179
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,875
The door was
locked from the inside.

180
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,000
[Excalibur]
Fool!

181
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,125
Precisely, Excalibur,

182
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,625
couldn't have said
it better myself.

183
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,958
Watson, you're indeed a fool.

184
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:16,875
But Holmes!

185
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,291
Now, Excalibur,
will you explain

186
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,708
to us what you see here...?

187
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,958
Use your impeccable logic
and great intelligence to

188
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,041
solve the puzzle of the
locked room and point out

189
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,708
the killer so we
can apprehend him.

190
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,208
[Excalibur]
It's quite basic, actually.

191
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,291
Perhaps the simplest
of tricks there is.

192
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,208
True, it may not seem
so simple from an

193
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,250
ordinary person's point of view.

194
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,416
Some people may even
consider it a baffling,

195
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,625
utterly perplexing problem.

196
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,833
Things will often appear

197
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,375
complicated
on the outside while,

198
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,875
in truth, they are
simplicity itself.

199
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,125
Of course, how one sees

200
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,041
these things depends
on the person.

201
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,583
Many people find that there
is a fine line separating the

202
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,583
very complex from
the very simple.

203
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,583
Okay, Excalibur,
I think we get your point.

204
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,291
Could you please just
solve the case now?

205
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,000
[Excalibur] Fool...!
You understand nothing.

206
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,666
[Watson]  Yes,
well you're spot on there.

207
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,916
Okay... I'm a fool.

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,541
Now please explain
the perpetrator's trick.

209
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,291
[Excalibur]
The trick is so elementary

210
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,458
that there's no
need for an explanation.

211
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,583
Ah?!

212
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,250
The killer is...

213
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,041
The killer is...

214
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,875
--You.

215
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,000
--What? Me?
--You.

216
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,750
[Watson cries as he is led away]

217
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,666
[Excalibur]
And thus...

218
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,208
The case was brilliantly solved.

219
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,208
Are you sure Watson
was really the killer?

220
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,541
That seems somewhat unlikely--

221
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,291
[Excalibur] To sum up, this
brings us to number

222
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,458
two hundred and seventy eight
of the one thousand provisions

223
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,708
you must observe...

224
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,125
I hate carrots...

225
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,750
never even think about
putting them in my food, get it?

226
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,083
[Ox]
Yeah I hate carrots too--

227
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,583
[Excalibur]
Silence!

228
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,500
This is number three hundred
and forty nine of the

229
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,958
one thousand provisions
you must observe...

230
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,375
Meisters should eat everything,

231
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,500
regardless of personal
likes and dislikes...

232
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,541
Never say anything as selfish
as 'I don't like carrots' again!

233
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,666
But that contradicts your--

234
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,000
[Excalibur]
Do you know what kind of

235
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,625
terrible tragedy such
indiscretion can lead to?

236
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,833
Perhaps this anecdote will
help you understand it better.

237
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,166
These events occurred just

238
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,333
after my legend began
in the twelfth century...

239
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,833
when I accompanied the
meister King Arthur

240
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,375
on an expedition to Rome.

241
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,166
[King Arthur] Facing an
army of this magnitude

242
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,625
will be arduous Excalibur.

243
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,166
[Excalibur] Saying such a thing
isn't like you, Arthur...

244
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
You mustn't lose heart.

245
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,583
[King Arthur]
Excalibur...

246
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,916
[Excalibur] The Knights of the
Round Table never give up.

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,291
No matter what...

248
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,458
You must remember that.

249
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,541
You swore an oath.

250
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,166
Of course you're right...

251
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,541
I've forgotten myself...

252
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,375
My comrades are depending on me.

253
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,166
[Excalibur]
We fight on for their sake.

254
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,583
Yes, we fight
for them Excalibur...

255
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,958
Will you lend
me your strength now?

256
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,708
[Excalibur]
Of course!

257
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,208
[battle cries]

258
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,208
And thus...My journey with
King Arthur continued on.

259
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,333
Your personality seemed
a lot different in that--

260
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,666
To sum up, that is what

261
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,000
led to number six hundred
and seventy nine of the

262
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,083
one thousand provisions
you must observe...

263
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,250
Always place a
dehumidifier in your room.

264
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,250
So... how long have you been
the kind of guy you are today?

265
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,625
[Excalibur] From what
I have told you thus far,

266
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,000
you can no doubt ascertain
that I was once a lowly,

267
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,458
rough-and-tumble sort of person.

268
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,500
[Ox] Never mind.
Forget I asked.

269
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,375
[Excalibur]
Listen up, everyone.

270
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,083
Drinks are on me today...

271
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,416
Drink all you want!

272
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,708
[girls ooh and awe]

273
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,333
[Girls] Excalibur!
This is so unlike you...

274
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,000
[Pretty Girl B]
Hey, Excalibur.

275
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,333
You're an incredible
man you know that?

276
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,291
[Excalibur]
I was all dried up.

277
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,458
Yes... Nothing could
satisfy me anymore.

278
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,750
I was but a shell of a man.

279
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:06,166
An unspeakable emptiness
grew deep inside my heart.

280
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,833
I became frustrated...
sad...hollow.

281
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:18,083
The gaping hole inside of me
was growing larger every day...

282
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:22,041
...slowly consuming
me from the inside out.

283
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,458
At least, until that day came.

284
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,875
[laughter]

285
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,750
[Pretty Girl C] Excalibur...
I'm so happy!

286
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,250
[laughter]

287
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,750
[Pretty Girl C] Excalibur!
Hurry! Come here!

288
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
[laughter]

289
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,208
[Pretty Girl C] I want to tell
you something Excalibur...

290
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,708
[laughter]

291
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,416
[Pretty Girl C]
I love you with all my heart!

292
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,458
[laughter]

293
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,875
[Pretty Girl C] If only every
day could be like this.

294
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,750
[Excalibur] You don't
need to worry about that...

295
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,125
I'm not going anywhere.

296
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,875
I'm afraid you don't understand.

297
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,458
The day will come when your
kindness is too great for me.

298
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,125
Your love will begin to
weigh me down,

299
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,583
and I will need my freedom.

300
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,125
I don't understand...

301
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,875
What are you
talking about Cathy?

302
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh Excalibur...

303
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,666
Please remember this
if nothing else...

304
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,750
I'll always love you,
no matter what happens.

305
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,375
You have to remember that.

306
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,833
Promise me that
you will remember.

307
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
[Excalibur]
I promise you,

308
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,208
I will remember.

309
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,708
[Excalibur]
However...

310
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,166
...just as she had predicted...

311
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,666
...our time together
did not last long...

312
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,041
There was to be no
happily ever after for us.

313
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,000
Thus...

314
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,583
What? It ends there?!

315
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:54,083
Thus, at long last, the fighting
between the rival gangs ended.

316
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:54,958
What happened.

317
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,291
To sum up, this leads us

318
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,041
to number seven hundred
and seventy eight of the

319
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,166
one thousand provisions
you must observe...

320
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,666
Never mail a letter without

321
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
the return address and
the proper postage...

322
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,416
and don't call collect.

323
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,208
I wonder what happened
with the pretty girl.

324
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,666
[Excalibur] What was that
you just said, young one?

325
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,708
I... I said I wonder what
happened with the pretty girl.

326
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,375
Hmm... you wish to know 
what happened next...?

327
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,708
As a gesture of respect
for your inquiry and interest, 

328
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,166
I will sing you a song.

329
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,666
[Ox] Uhh... How does me
wanting to know what happened

330
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,625
make you want to sing--?

331
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,125
Fool!

332
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,083
As someone who is unaware
of the vital role that singing

333
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,083
has played in the
cultural history of mankind,

334
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,208
you are in no
position to question me...

335
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,541
Remember that the next time

336
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,791
you stop to consider
your place in this world....

337
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,666
You do not possess the power
to deny a singer his song.

338
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,541
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

339
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,791
Uh... yeah.

340
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,166
Then I shall begin...

341
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,416

[Ox]
Umm...

358
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,458
Excalibur!

359
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,208
Please... how long is this
torture going to last?

360
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,000
Well... I think that about
covers the one thousand

361
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,541
provisions that you
are required to observe. 

362
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,250
[Ox]
Oh, the humanity...

363
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,583
Now, I would like for you

364
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,416
to participate in the
most important provision, 

365
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
number four hundred
and fifty two...

366
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,875
...the five hour
storytelling party.

367
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,916
You are chosen.

368
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,291
[Excalibur]
It shall all be yours.

369
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,250
Victory and glory!

370
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,125
[Ox]
Victory and glory!

371
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,833
[Excalibur]
You shall rule the world,

372
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:14,416
reining above all others
as a mighty warrior king.

373
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,291
So, let us go forth together...
for victory... and for glory!

374
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,500
[Excalibur]
Excuse me young lad.

375
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,333
What is the meaning of this?

376
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,916
Oh, I'm sorry...

377
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,583
But I already have a partner,
so I really should be going now.

378
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,250
[Excalibur] Then why
did you come here?

379
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,833
Well... Funny story.

380
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,000
I had originally intended
to write about you for a

381
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,375
report I was assigned in school.

382
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,583
But you're lame, so forget it.

383
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,208
I never finished my report.

384
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,166
I'm gonna be in big trouble.

385
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,416
Hey, Black Star...

386
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Did you finish the
report that was due today?

387
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,666
Yeah... I got it right here.

388
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,041
It's only one page. Don't
you think that's a little short.

389
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,791
Course it's short.
Why wouldn't it be...

390
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,208
There's only one
word for that thing.

391
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,708
So, what word did you write?

392
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,458
[Excalibur]
Fool!

393
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:21,916
♪ closing song ♪

394
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,166
[Excalibur] Attention,
meisters around the country!

395
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,000
I have a great
opportunity to announce.

396
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,458
You want to be
a warrior, don't you...?

397
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,875
So why not test yourself
by mastering me?

398
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,666
Only one person can
have this honor, so act quickly.

399
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,958
Observe my exquisite form...!

400
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,041
Notice my unparalleled
sharpness.

401

[All]
Lame!

409
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,666
[Maka]
Boy am I glad I didn't get

410
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,416
involved with
that Excalibur mess.

411
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,916
[Ox]
You're lame!

412
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,083
[Maka] Hey, Ox. I've been
meaning to ask you something.

413
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,625
[Ox] Oh...? Is it about
my stylish hairdo?

414
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,041
[Maka]
No, it's not that.

415
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,708
[Ox] Then my custom-made
glasses, perhaps?

416
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,125
[Maka]
Not that either!

417
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,125
[Ox]
What, then?!

418
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,000
[Maka]
Tell me...

419
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,541
...do you wear boxers or briefs?

420
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,958
[Ox]
You're lame!

421
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,625
[Maka] On the next
episode of Soul Eater...

422
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,000
The Eve Party Nightmare...
And So the Curtain Rises?

423
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,166
[Ox]
By the way...

424
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,833
...I wear briefs.
