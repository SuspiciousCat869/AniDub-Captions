Isn't that one of the

A fear of disapproval makes
one strive to be a good person.

A fear of being powerless

Fear is a driving force

Because of this, the amount of

If such a god does exist,

but it comes in handy...

163
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:39,652
Anything's better than
going in blind, right Sid?

164
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:40,445
And what's more,

165
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,613
we're using a radio as the

166
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,157
medium to establish
our soul resonance.

167
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,493
Azusa's the only
one who can do that.

168
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,745
I appreciate all
of the compliments...

169
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:49,996
...but back to business.

170
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,623
[Sid]
Right. What's up ahead?

171
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:54,501
[Azusa] The signal from the room
containing the target is weak...

172
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:57,045
Still, I am detecting a
witch's soul and an

173
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:58,880
old monster's soul...

174
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,423
Oh, and be careful.

175
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:03,176
There's another very strong
soul in there along with them.

176
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,762
Yeah, I'm picking up
on those souls as well...

177
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:06,888
But our assignment is to

178
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:09,182
destroy the
Magic Tool in there...

179
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,184
...no matter what.

180
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,352
[Alarm System]
Intruder alert...

181
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,853
Intruder alert.

182
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:16,356
Not good. We've been detected.

183
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,357
[Lab Arachnid 2]
Hurry to the main entrance!

184
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,693
We need to alert the bodyguard.

185
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,069
Why the main entrance...?

186
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,196
Hey Azusa...
what's going on?

187
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,407
Hold on... I'm checking.

188
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:31,121
This path leads directly
to the main entrance.

189
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,296
[Azusa] What's an academy
student doing here?

190
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,798
[Black Star]
Keep on comin' at me.

191
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,635
I'll tear every single
one of you into pieces.

192
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:49,389
My what a lively young
guest we have here.

193
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,643
That girl...! I know her!

194
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,312
Ah...! You guys again?

195
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,861
This guy?

196
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,158
[Tsubaki]
It's the samurai Mifune...

197
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:10,326
Why are you in this place?

198
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,288
[Mifune]
Why...?

199
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,373
I'm here doing my duty...

200
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,500
My sword is sworn to
protect little children,

201
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,044
like the witch Angela...

202
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,712
But you are also a young child.

203
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:21,963
Why have you come here,

204
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,215
What are you doing
standing against me again?

205
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,634
Is there a problem?

206
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:29,220
You come with me, Miss Angela.

207
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:40,982
That's interesting.

208
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,947
Get ready!

209
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,579
Let's go.

210
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,832
Infinite Sword Attack.

211
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,384
[Black Star thinks]
The swords may only be

212
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:10,970
stuck into the ground, but
they all radiate danger.

213
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:18,687
Oh...? A child can
withstand Mifune's attack.

214
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,734
[Mifune] Blocking my sword and
immediately counter-attacking...

215
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:27,654
I can tell you've improved.

216
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:28,988
Maybe I was wrong...

217
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,990
Perhaps you're
not a child anymore.

218
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:33,076
Don't mess with me!

219
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,079
You may know
how to talk a big game,

220
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,414
but I've beaten
you once before,

221
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:38,581
and I can do it again.

222
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,250
[Angela]
You didn't beat him, stupid!

223
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,794
Mifune's always nice to
kids no matter what.

224
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:44,170
He'd never fight seriously

225
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,673
against a dumb
little boy like you!

226
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:48,883
What kind of man is he?

227
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,969
You are not to
show any mercy...

228
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,221
Is that understood?

229
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,098
[Mifune]
You may be a child...

230
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,266
...but I won't let myself

231
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,060
give in to the
same opponent twice.

232
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,564
[Sid] This is the tool we've
heard so much about.

233
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,773
If I had to guess,

234
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,027
I'd say it's used to
alter human morality.

235
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:11,781
[Sid]
Hmm?

236
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,700
What's this?

237
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,495
I'll bring it back.

238
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:21,916
Azusa! What's the
situation at the entrance?

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,043
[Azusa]
The academy student is

240
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:26,046
fighting the strong
soul from earlier.

241
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:26,963
However...

242
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:27,964
the difference in their

243
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,550
relative strengths
is overwhelming.

244
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,303
[Black Star]
Tsubaki...!

245
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:34,429
Kusarigama Mode!

246
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,930
[Tsubaki]
Right!

247
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:40,060
This tool needs to be
destroyed immediately.

248
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,020
It wasn't part of the plan...

249
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:43,855
...but I should be able
to take care of this,

250
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:46,524
with that student
keeping them distracted.

251
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:48,943
Whoever that is out there,

252
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,154
we'll need to take him with us.

253
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,241
I'll just use your own
sword against you.

254
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,125
You're still mine!

255
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,212
Three Paths Shot!

256
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,382
Black Star!

257
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,141
Go--
Smoke Bomb Mode!

258
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,729
A ninja sword... a Kusarigama...

259
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,481
and Smoke Bomb...

260
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:28,650
That magic weapon... is she--?

261
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,443
[Black Star] Thanks
for that, Tsubaki...!

262
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,987
Now, Enchanted Sword Mode!

263
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,784
[Mosquito] Indeed,
there's no doubt.

264
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,285
It was Lady Arachne's sister

265
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,246
who made that
kind of Magic Weapon...

266
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,791
Rumor has it that one of those
weapons joined the DWMA...

267
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,668
It must be her.

268
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,877
Oh...

269
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,796
Let's go!

270
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:53,675
[Mifune] There's dark energy
coming from this sword.

271
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:54,426
[Black Star]
Tsubaki!

272
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:55,927
Yes!

273
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,723
Shadow Star!

274
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:08,690
[Mifune] Is that all you can do,

275
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,734
Enchanted Sword?

276
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,570
He's free!

277
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:15,488
[Mifune]
Infinite Sword Attack...

278
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,657
One sword!

279
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,077
Two!

280
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,454
Three!

281
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:23,872
Four swords!

282
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:24,581
Five!

283
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:25,707
Six!

284
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,375
Seven swords!

285
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,920
Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven!

286
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,547
Twelve Swords!

287
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,467
Punishment!

288
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,305
He's striking all the
surrounding swords!

289
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:43,058
Twenty-four blows total.

290
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:47,228
Rather effective to use
twelve blades against an enemy.

291
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,023
Black Star!

292
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:54,652
[Mifune] The wounds
aren't too deep,

293
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,821
but surely you've had enough...

294
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,824
Weapon, your name
is Tsubaki, right...?

295
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,451
Take this child and go.

296
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:02,494
[Tsubaki]
Why would you waste

297
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:05,080
the skills you have
to help a witch?

298
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,206
[Black Star]
Damn it...!

299
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:09,167
She calls that not
fighting seriously?

300
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,127
[Mifune] Why did
you two come here?

301
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,755
Because this lab
is run by a witch?

302
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:15,173
[Tsubaki] That witch
is responsible

303
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,633
for hurting our friend...

304
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,177
We came to get revenge.

305
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,596
[Black Star] I'm gonna punish
her for what she did to Maka.

306
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,973
No one hurts my friend
and gets away with it.

307
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:24,766
No one!

308
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,685
Do you understand me?!

309
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,940
I see... Sorry about that.

310
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,401
There's no reason
for you to apologize...

311
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:36,277
I know you're a
good man at heart...

312
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,656
A sword like yours shouldn't
be defending this organization!

313
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,701
You care about helping children,
and you have incredible skill...

314
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:45,036
You'd fit in well
at the academy...

315
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,288
Why not become
a teacher instead?

316
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,123
What...?

317
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,041
A teacher at the academy?

318
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,459
--Mifune!
--Hi, teacher!

319
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,920
--You're the best teacher ever!
--We love Mih-foon-ay!

320
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:54,921
No... I...

321
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,673
I could never do that.

322
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,842
Mifune! Mifune!

323
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,719
[Mifune]
That's an impossible dream.

324
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,263
The DWMA despises witches...

325
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:05,598
I could never
bring Angela there...

326
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:08,268
Who will protect her if I don't?

327
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,936
Hey Boss... who's he?

328
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,440
Ah him...? He's the
new bodyguard.

329
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:14,816
Now that I've got Mifune...

330
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,610
...this whole town
is as good as mine.

331
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:18,820
Hey, mister...

332
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,322
...are you a samurai?

333
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,783
You've got a pretty
awesome sword there...

334
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:24,951
Do you think I could touch it?

335
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,703
Now, now, young master!

336
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,496
[Mifune]
No, you can't.

337
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,581
A sword like this is

338
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,541
too dangerous for
a kid like you...

339
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,126
But I'll tell you what...

340
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,837
Take this sweet instead.

341
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,631
Hey Mister Samurai...
do you like candy?

342
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:40,133
I don't eat them.

343
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,427
Well, then why do you
have 'em in your pocket?

344
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,596
Do you like candy, kid?

345
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,805
Uh-huh.

346
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,974
That's why I carry them.

347
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,768
Huh?

348
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,436
[Mob Boss]
Hope you're ready, Mifune...

349
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,521
I have an assignment for you.

350
00:17:56,316 --> 00:18:00,195
Some of my boys have managed
to track down a certain witch.

351
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,614
What I want you to
do is capture that witch...

352
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,157
...and kill her.

353
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,333
[Angela] You came here
to kill me, didn't you?

354
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,044
That's what everybody
else wants, anyway...

355
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:20,048
There's always a lot of
killing going on around here.

356
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,551
[Mifune]
This little girl...

357
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,261
Is the witch?

358
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:29,224
Where did that
traitor run off to?

359
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,767
What was that guy thinking...?

360
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,937
If he'd just killed the witch,
the payoff woulda been huge!

361
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:36,898
[Mifune]
It'll be all right.

362
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,608
They're gone now.

363
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,153
Candy?

364
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,446
It's okay...

365
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,948
Go ahead.

366
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,244
[Mosquito] What's wrong
with you, Mifune...?

367
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,162
Hurry up and finish them off!

368
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:54,040
Why? This battle has
already been ended.

369
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,418
The DWMA is our
staunchest enemy...

370
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,671
There's no reason
to let these two live.

371
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:01,089
If you don't take care of them,

372
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:03,883
I cannot guarantee
the safety of Miss Angela.

373
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,635
La-la-la...! La-la-la...!
La-la-la!

374
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,054
[Mifune]
Angela...

375
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:09,389
I'm not done with you yet.

376
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:11,307
No, don't, Black Star!

377
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:15,311
Mifune isn't this enough!?

378
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,855
[Mifune thinks] As a witch,
Angela has no

379
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,274
chance of living
safely among humans...

380
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,775
The protection Arachnophobia

381
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,570
offers is an
invaluable resource.

382
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:26,656
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,789
Mister Mosquito!

384
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,792
Another attack...?

385
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,669
Where's it coming from?

386
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:41,880
[explosion]

[Lab Arachnid 1
Mosquito...!

388
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:46,384
There are explosives everywhere!

389
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,095
Get out of here
before you're injured!

390
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:51,014
More blood...

391
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,564
Miss Angela, come this way.

392
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,817
[Sid]
I missed the second shot.

393
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,069
I guess it's not surprising

394
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,987
that he's the student
who showed up.

395
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,781
[Naigus] It's no big shock
to find him here.

396
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:08,865
Everybody knows how much

397
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:10,950
Black Star likes to fight.

398
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,160
Never could've hit an enemy

399
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,037
that far off
without your help...

400
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,622
Thanks, Azusa.

401
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:16,915
Within ten kilometers,

402
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,793
my margin of
error is negligible...

403
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,628
That samurai is good, though...

404
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,339
He found us and
moved into a blind spot.

405
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,717
As I suspected,
he's no ordinary fighter.

406
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,638
[Black Star]
Hey, hold it!

407
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,598
Let's finish what we started!

408
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,100
[Mifune]
Don't push yourself...

409
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:36,851
You're strong,
I'll give you that...

410
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,313
Keep improving as you
have been, and you'll be fine.

411
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:43,400
Try to understand the
other presence within Tsubaki...

412
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:44,693
The Enchanted Sword mode

413
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,070
will work better
for you that way.

414
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,949
I know a lot about swords...

415
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,952
...and you've got
yourself a good one, kid.

416
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,995
Yeah, I know that!

417
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,957
[Mifune] That friend of yours
who was hurt by the witch...

418
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,917
See that she gets this.

419
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,519
[Soul] Well, I think
I'm headed home...

420
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:21,438
You gonna be
okay here by yourself?

421
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,897
Yeah... thanks, Soul.

What now...?

426
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,531
Are you going to
sign my face again?

427
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,450
[Black Star]
Here, catch.

[Maka]
What is this?

429
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,122
[Black Star] I got it from this
soft-hearted samurai I know...

430
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,707
It's just candy.

431
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,753
What's with that guy...?

432
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,172
He didn't even
apologize for earlier.

433
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,673
Who knows?

434
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,926
[Black Star] I went to
that laboratory to get revenge

435
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,429
for a friend who got hurt.

436
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:58,141
And I ended up playing
Mifune's damn candy striper.

437
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,775
What kind of sweet is this?

438
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,610
I think that it's...

439
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,904
... seaweed-flavored!

00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:15,992
