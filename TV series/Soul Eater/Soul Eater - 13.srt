A sound soul...

00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,500
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,666
...and a sound body.

00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,083

The guard's fast asleep...

Perfect.

[Free] Who's there...?
Talk to me.

7
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,041
[Eruka] I... I was sent here
by someone who wants

8
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,583
to break you out of
that cell and free

00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,958
you from witch prison...

10
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,958
I'm gonna let you
out now okay.

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,125
What kinda person
do you think I am...?

12
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,041

Thank you!!

[Eruka]
Sure thing. No problem.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,625
It's easy to get outta there
when you got someone

16
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,083
on the outside with a key.

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,541
But you wanna know
what I was gonna try

18
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,708
before you showed up?

19
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,625
I had a plan!

20
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,291
Never mind that.

21
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,166
We need to hurry.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,625
They'll be coming after us.

23
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,833
See, I was planning

24
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,416
to try that thing they
do in the movies...

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,791
You know, where they
tunnel under the wall

26
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,916
by using a spoon to
steadily dig away at

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,375
the ground underneath it...?

28
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,041
I always thought that
was a really cool idea

29
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,250
when they did that...

30
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:30,000
So...decided I would
give it a try myself... 

31
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,833
But all they ever gave
me was chopsticks!

I tried to think of
another way out...

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,041
I thought about it
all the time...

36
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,333
...then I realized something...

37
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,291
I'm just not an idea man.

38
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,625
[Eruka] I suppose it
doesn't matter now,

39
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,083
but you could have
peed on the bars of

40
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,250
your cell everyday...

41
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,583
and gradually corroded
them away, right? 

42
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:55,916
Oh, damn it!?

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,333
Why didn't I try that?

44
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,791
I'm such an idiot.

They're coming after us...!

47
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,500
If your hands and feet
are still shackled like that,

48
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,666
you can't fight and we'll--

49
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:11,875
Be careful...

50
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,416
I smell someone nearby.

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,833
They're already here!

00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,416

[Free] I was locked inside that
prison for two hundred years.

56
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,250
If you think I'm gonna
let you take me back there

57
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,875
without putting up a fight...

Oh no...! This is really bad...!

If I don't get you out of here,

00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,291
then I'm gonna
end up dead too!

62
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,458
Calm down...

63
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,666
It'll take more than
that to kill me...

64
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,208
You should know that.

She couldn't kill me.

Not until you explain

at school on a Sunday.

Let's get started.

84
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,583
But first I want
to warn you both...

85
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,375
Your lesson today will
be extremely dangerous.

86
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,375
Failing it could result in
permanent damage to you.

87
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,791
If that happens,

88
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,375
you may never be able
to match soul wavelengths again.

89
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,125
Do you want to
back down now...?

00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,708
It's not too late.

Hey!

93
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,083
Your meister has
made a decision...

94
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,666
Now accept it.

95
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,541
Why are you so
anxious to do this Maka?

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,166
Fine. Let's begin then...

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,041
Turn around so that
you're facing each other.

98
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,375
Now tell your partner
what his or her flaws are.

99
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,916
Our special lesson is
insulting each other?!

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,916
[Stein]
Yes, you could say that.

101
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,750
You're stubborn and reckless.

102
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,083
All you like to do
for fun is read,

103
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:51,833
so you're boring.

104
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,875
And you have fat ankles.

105
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,458
That's another one...!

106
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,541
You always hit me...

107
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,875
That's a flaw, all right.

108
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,750
[Soul] Professor... is beating
me up part of the lesson?

109
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,041
[Stein] No more
beating on Soul, Maka.

110
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,666
[Stein] This may seem like a
meaningless training

111
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,750

112
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,208
but these are
no ordinary candles...

They're designed to
heighten a person's emotions.

They're designed to
heighten a person's emotions.

With these burning,

116
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,291
even a casual remark
could ruin their friendship.

117
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,583
But, if they can
get beyond this,

118
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,708
they will be better for it...

119
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,083
Their soul wavelengths will

120
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,708
resonate even more
strongly than before.

121
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,708
What's going on?

122
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,125
You've been acting
weird lately...

123
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,666
You never even asked
if I wanted to do this lesson...

124
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,541
I wanna know what
this is really about.

125
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,833
This is about me getting
stronger so I can keep you

126
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,041
from getting hurt
that badly ever again. 

127
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,208
The meister fights in order
to make the weapon stronger.

128
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,625
You know that...

129
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,750
You wanna get stronger
in order to protect your weapon.

130
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,625
That's all backwards.
You're crazy.

131
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,791
Crazy...?!

132
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,833
And why shouldn't
I want to be stronger?

133
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,416
I hate having to be
protected by you, Soul!

134
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,791
Don't yell so loud...

135
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,166
It's annoying me.

136
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,625
[Maka]
I'll shout if I want to.

137
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,000
You're the one
who's crazy, Soul.

138
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,583
Why are you so against
me getting stronger?!

139
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,875
[Demon] You're going to 
need more power.

140
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,291
Power so overwhelmingly
strong you can say

141
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,958
goodbye to all your fears.

142
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,458
Find a rule to break.

143
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:12,458
It will make you stronger
than you thought possible.

[Soul thinks] I'm not afraid
of that little demon.

145
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm not afraid of
becoming stronger, either.

146
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,000
Forget about it,
and sit down, will ya...?

147

This isn't good.

Huh...? How many more
of them are there?

165
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,125
That's not something
you need to know right now...

166
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,458
Of course, I could bring
them all out at once...

167
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,833
You'd be ripped apart
in the process, though.

168
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,166
That's awful...!

169
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,500
How could you devil woman?!

170
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,375
[Free] You're the one
who set me free?

171
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,958
I wouldn't have
expected it from a witch.

172
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,791
Yes, I'm Medusa...

173
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,833
Nice to meet you...

174
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,416
Man with the Magic Eye.

175
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,458
Man with the Magic Eye, huh?

176
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,666
Of course...

177
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,625
What else could you
call me, after all...?

178
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,708
In that prison, even my
name was taken away from me.

179
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,375
But as of today,
I'm officially free again...

180
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,125
All right, then...

181
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,208
My new name is "Free."

182
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,583
Yes, that's right...

183
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,083
You're Free.

184
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,166
[Medusa laughs]

185
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,041
Free, huh...? We'll have to
see about that, won't we?

186
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,291
I owe ya one...

187
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,500
I'd like to
repay you somehow.

188
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,250
No, no... That's all right.

189
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,458
Don't worry about it.

190
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,250
Please let me.

191
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,916
I like to settle my debts.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,333
Well maybe...

193
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,666
...there is one thing
I could ask you to do for me...

194
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,666
There's a certain weapon
and meister pair

195
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,125
I would like to see crushed.

196
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,416
From the DWMA...

197
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,541
That what you mean?

198
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,375
Yes.

199
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,958
I don't like Death or
that school of his...

200
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,875
With all his damn rules...

201
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,375
You've got a deal witch...

202
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,333
I'll take 'em out.

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,833
[Black Star]
Hello, London...!

204
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,125
Black Star has arrived... Yahoo!

205
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,125
It's snowing...

206
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,541
Aren't you freezing?

207
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,916
[Black Star]
Who cares about snow...?

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,208
Snow can't touch me...!

209
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,416
I could be naked out here

210
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,375
and it wouldn't
bother me at all.

211
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,833
This whole thing sucks...

212
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,333
Ever since Soul got himself
hurt by that Demon Sword,

213
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,541
all our extra lessons

214
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,250
have to be done with
at least two teams...

215
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,750
You guys better not
slow me down okay?

216
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,291
Hey you two, would you
come take a look at this?

217
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,750
It's so beautiful at night,
don't you think...?

218
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,458
Huh? Yay! London!

219
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,666
[Black Star]
What's with them?

220
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,916
Anyway, Maka...

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,916
I can't detect souls, 
so this one's up to you.

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,125
Tell us what you see.

223
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,791
[Maka]
I'm on it.

224
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,500
'Kay, let's see...

225
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,291
I'm focusing in on any
souls that are in this area...

226
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,708
There's one right there.

227
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,625
Hey, you're right...

228
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,958
What does that dude want?

229
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:22,958
I don't know...

230
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,541
Something's wrong
with his soul...

231
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,791
It's not normal...

232
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,291
There's a bunch of
stuff all mixed together.

233
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,708
Some human...

234
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,291
...some witch...

235
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,833
...and I'm sensing
something else too.

236
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,708
Here you are.

237
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,291
This guy wants a fight...

238
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,791
Looks like our lesson is
getting off to a good start.

239
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,833
Be careful, though...

240
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,916
He's probably able
to use magic.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,125
[Black Star] Tsubaki,
Enchanted Sword Mode...

242
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,250
Let's finish
this guy off quickly.

243
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,291
But you still
can't handle that one.

244
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,250
I just have to last
for a few seconds... let's go!

245
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,916
Yeah...Right!

246
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,541
Impressive... he's strong.

247
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,750
Let's go Soul Resonance!

248
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,958
Amazing...!

249
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,166
Their resonance
is still stable...

250
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,500
...and is that...

251
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,541
...Black Star's soul?!

252
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,458
[Black Star] London Bridge
is falling down dude.

253
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,666
[Free]
Wolf Wolves...

254
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,375
Wolf Wolves...

255
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,666
Ice Cone!

256
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,583
Tsubaki!

257
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,083
[Tsubaki]
Right!

258
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,458
What!?

259
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,916
She stopped it
with her shadow!

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
How about a taste of
my new technique?

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,625
Shadow Star!
[echoes]

262
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,666
Star...Star...Star...

263
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,875
Star...Star.

264
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,750
I told you it was
too much for you!

265
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,625
[Soul] He didn't
even last ten seconds.

266
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,708
Black Star might be
strong, all right...

267
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,833
but he's still crazy.

268
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,875
Now then, who's next?

269
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,958
[Soul] You shouldn't drop
your guard like that Mister. 

270
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,125
He got 'em... No...!

271
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,125
Soul, get outta there!

272
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,083
It happens a lot...
but fortunately,

273
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,291
I can afford to
let my guard down.

274
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,416
What's with this guy...?

275
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,583
What's he doing?

276
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,916
Look at that!

277
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
His wound's closing up!

278
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,291
Of course it's closing up...

279
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,583
What else would it do?

280
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,166
I am immortal.

281
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
This guy is an immortal?

282
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,750
[Free] Maybe it would help if
you could see my true form?

283
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,708
What do you mean,
'your true form'?

284
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:31,291
[Free begins to growl
as he powers up]

285
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,583
What's happening
to the shape of his soul...?

286
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,250
It's changing!

287
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,958
I know who he is now...

288
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,458
We've run into
the legendary wolfman... 

289
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,708
...the one who stole
the witch's eye!

290
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,625
[Free bellows]

291
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,541
Now, Soul...

292
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,625
It's time to transform!

293
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,125
Yeah!

294
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,458
Okay, Soul. Let's go.

295
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,916
[Soul]
Right!

296
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
Ow!

297
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,583
What are you doing Maka?!

298
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,333
Your handle's too hot.
I can't hold you.

299
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,958
What!?

300
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,625
It's like before...

301
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,375
That time when Black Star
and Soul were fighting Kid.

302
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,333
Black Star tried to lift
Soul but couldn't.

303
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,875
And this time,
Soul's handle burned Maka.

304
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,708
I don't think their
soul wavelengths are in sync.

305
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,875
[Medusa laughs]

306
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,208
[Medusa]
Poor Soul Eater,

307
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,250
with all that black
blood still inside of you...

308
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,208
...how are you and your
precious meister Maka

309
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,625
going to handle this
turn of events, I wonder?

310
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,916
And so...
the experiment begins.

311
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,750
[Maka thinks]
So... difficult... to breathe...

312
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,333
Why is this happening...?

313
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,833
How do I breathe, again...?

314
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,250
Just inhale
and exhale, right...?

315
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,000
And how do I use my weapon?

316
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,666
Fighting Wolf Fist...Let's go!

317
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,083
[Soul]
Maka!

318
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,750
Ice Cylinder!

319
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,666
Soul!

320
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,291
[Free]
Magic Eye Cannon.

321
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,125
Damn it. That was not good...

322
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,000
I always forget not to
put those things where

323
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,375
they can skewer me.

324
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,541
But it's okay...

325
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,083
No problem at all,
nothing to see here...

326
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,125
After all...

327
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,291
...I'm immortal.

328
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,375
He's an immortal...
magic... werewolf...

329
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,958
I can't deny that this
guy is strong,

330
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,166
but he sure is... clumsy.

331
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,708
I guess sitting in a
witch prison for

332
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,916
two hundred years
would make anyone rusty...

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,583
I can't seem to handle my 
magic as well as I used to.

334
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,583
Maka... We have to do something.

335
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,166
If you can't use Soul,
try fighting with me.

336
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,583
It won't work...

337
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,041
Even if I could figure out
how to use you in time...

338
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,541
I still wouldn't be
able to defeat him.

339
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,458
[Free]
You meisters...

340
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,000
The great Lord Death
plays by his own rules...

341
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,416
It's those rules that decide...
what evil is.

342
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,833
What are you talking about?

343
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,833
[Free] You all follow
the reaper so blindly...

344
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,125
What gives him the right

345
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,250
to decide how the
world should be run? 

346
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,291
He trains you to hunt down souls
he believes are unworthy.

347
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,791
A soul like mine wouldn't
be safe from him.

348
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,916
But I for one am not

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
going to accept that
kind of future...

350
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,583
I refuse.

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,958
It's my turn now.

352
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,416
I'm gonna be the judge.

353
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,916
I'm not goin' play
by his rules anymore.

354
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
Maka!

355
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,500
[Maka]
Soul...

356
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,458
Transform back into a scythe.

357
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,500
Wait, Maka...

358
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,166
...you couldn't even
hold me before.

359
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,583
Do it!

360
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,166
[Tsubaki] Using a weapon when
your wavelengths aren't

361
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,375
in sync is incredibly hard on
the mind as well as the body...

362
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,041
But what else can she do...?

363
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,708
Maka is a scythe meister,
and Soul is her weapon.

364
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,000
Maka... Your hands...

365
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,208
[Maka thinks]
I'm going to become...

366
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,666
...stronger!

367
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,708
Take this!

368
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,291
You'll have to do
better than that.

369
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,333
How's this?

370
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:40,750
Damn!

371
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,666
What are you doing...?

372
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,250
Calm down, take a breath.

373
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,291
Stay out of it...

374
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,458
I'm going to do this.

375
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,041
I refuse to let him defeat me!

376
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,208
[Soul]
Don't be an idiot!

377
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,208
If shouting like a

378
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,291
spoiled brat made
you stronger,

379
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,208
everyone would do it!

380
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,416
[Maka]
Shut up...!

381
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
It's because of you
saying stuff like that

382
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,791
that our wavelengths
are out of sync.

383
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,916
That's not cool, Soul.

384
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,666
It isn't cool at all!

385
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,000
[Demon]
Gain power...

386
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,416
I can show you
how if you need.

387
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,833
Shut your mouth, Maka! 

388
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you even know, anyway?!

389
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,041
That is enough, you two!

390
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,083
[Tsubaki]
You guys are a team...

391
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,333
You have to work
together if you

392
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,750
want to do anything...

393
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,083
One person can't make
a decision without the other...

394
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,708
You decide together...
and you fight together. 

395
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,791
[Soul] Right, like Black Star
stops to consult you

396
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,166
every time he's about
to do something stupid?

397
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,708
[Tsubaki] I'll admit
Black Star makes

398
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,250
some dumb calls
from time to time.

399
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,291
But the important thing is,

400
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,875
I'm here to back him
up no matter how

401
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,333
big a fool he is....

402
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,958
If we're fools,
we're fools together.

403
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,291
That's the kind of team we are.

404
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,875
[Maka thinks]
Maybe Tsubaki's right...

405
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,750
I want to become stronger...

406
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,125
but there's no reason
I have to do it alone...

407
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,583
All I've been thinking
about this whole time was

408
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,958
catching up to Soul somehow.

409
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:55,208
No matter how hot
it gets, I'm not letting go.

410
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,541
Soul and I are going
to grow stronger together.

411
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,625
[Soul] I don't get what you've
been so worried about...

412
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,041
I'm not even all that strong.

413
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,208
If you're done telling me

414
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,291
what to do, maybe we can
work together now.

415
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,916
[Soul]
Hey, Demon guy...

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,083
You can lead me 
wherever you want...

417
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,416
Let's hear your plan...

418
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,791
...and we'll see
whether I follow it.

419
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,416
In that case, come with me.

420
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,166
Overwhelming madness
and power await.

421
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,208
You... got it.

422
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,916
Let's go Soul Resonance!

423
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,000
Excellent...... finally...

424
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,750
...the black blood is
starting to do its work.

425
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,000
Wow...! 

426
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,250
Their soul resonance
rate is incredible. 

427
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,875
[Maka thinks]
What's happening?

428
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,625
Something's wrong...

429
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,083
Is Soul devouring me?

430
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,250
This should be interesting.

431
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,583
A weapon with black blood

432
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,166
has the power to 
swallow its meister's mind...

433
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,208
Now... let's see you raise
your resonance rate even higher.

434
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,750
[Soul]
Damn! It feels like my

435
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,458
consciousness
is being carried away.

436
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,208
I won't let it...

437
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,250
I will stay in control.

438
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,333
The legendary super
skill of the scythe meister.

439
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,208
Witch Hunter!

440
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,583
A fancy technique...

441
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,875
Fine by me...

442
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,708
Wolf Wolves,

443
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,458
Wolf Wolves, Wolf Wolves.

444
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,541
Wolftail Wall!

445
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,416
We can get past that.

446
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,458
[Maka thinks]
It doesn't hurt; it's not hot;

447
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,916
I'm not scared...

448
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,208
I will not be beaten!

449
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,833
I won't ever let
Soul get hurt again!

450
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,833
I'm going to get stronger!

451
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,541
Figure-6 Hunter!

452
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,333
What the hell?!

453
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,166
We get him?

454
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,625
Almost there.

455
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,333
A meister throwing her weapon
aside and attacking?

456
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,458
Maka!

457
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,458
Maka!

458
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,208
[Maka bellows]

459
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,166
Down you go!

460
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,333
Soul...

461
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,625
I guess...your ankles...
aren't that fat. 

462
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,041
Maka!

463
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,416
If you think I'm falling
all by myself, think again...

464
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,416
I'm taking you with me.

465
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,833
[Soul]
Maka... Damn!

466
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,041
There's no way
I'm letting you go.

467
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,041
[Black Star]
Yahoo!

468
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,750
It's a good thing I'm
here to look out for you two.

469
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,500
This isn't over yet...

470
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,083
Wolf Wolves, Wolf Wolves,

471
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,625
Wolf Wolves.

472
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,916
I'll just make an ice cylinder
under my feet, kick off it,

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,458
and fly back up there...

474
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,458
I can do that, right...?

475
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,458
Of course I can...!

476
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,250
I'm immortal!

477
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,916
I can do whatever I want!

478
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,375
Ice Cylinder!

479
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,375
Wrong place again.

480
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,166
A truly impressive
screw up, even for him.

481
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,375
[Free] My first fight in
two hundred years,

482
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,541
and I screwed it up...

483
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,625
I'll get it right next time,

484
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,916
I just need some practice...

485
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,250
Yeah... just a little practice.

486
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,541
[Medusa thinks] I've seen
enough to convince me...

487
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,708
If I continue my research
on black blood,

488
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,416
I am certain
I can create a Kishin.

489
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,250
Are you sure you're
gonna be all right?

490
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,375
Yeah I'm fine, thanks.

491
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,625
From the way your hands look,

492
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm guessing I'll be the

493
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,416
one on cooking duty
for a while, huh?

494
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,541
That oughta be interesting.

495
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,458
[Maka]
Black... blood?

496
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:47,041
♪ closing song ♪

497
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,083
[Soul] Well,
we survived our lesson...

498
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,166
Black Star, what d'ya say

499
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,625
we go grab some
boring English food? 

500
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,458
[Black Star] Let's find
someplace with karaoke too.

501
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,083
I feel a star moment coming on.

502
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,708
[Soul] So, should we eat
fish and chips or...

503
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,000
...fish and chips?

504
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,208
[Black Star] Food,
karaoke, then sightseeing!

505
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,291
[Soul]
If we're feeling crazy,

506
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,541
we could try some
bangers and mash.

507
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,708
[Black Star]
I'm kinda tired.

508
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,708
Maybe I'll just go 
home and watch t.v.

509
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,416
[Soul] On the next
episode of Soul Eater...

510
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,833
The Super Written Exam...

511
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,000
Heart-pounding, Reeling,
and Restless, You're Kidding?

512
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,083
[Soul and Black Star] What...?!
We have a test next week?!

513
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,000
[Soul] Ah, man that
spoiled my appetite.

514
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,083
No Yorkshire pudding for me.
