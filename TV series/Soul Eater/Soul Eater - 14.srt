[Maka]
A sound soul...

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,750
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,416
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,250
Yea...! Yea...! Yea!

5
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,416
It's done, Lord Death...

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,458
We have officially
accomplished our mission.

7
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,958
Well done, Maka.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,208
You have successfully
collected ninety-nine Kishin

9
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,625
souls and the
soul of one witch...

10
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,291
Congratulations...

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,791
As promised, I will make
Soul my personal weapon.

12
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,250
You'll finally be a Deathscythe.

13
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,583
Yeah...

14
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey... What are you doing
down there on the floor...

15
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,125
You're gonna be late for school.

17
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,916
All right people,
as I'm sure you know...

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,916
there isn't much time remaining.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,041
In three short days,
you'll all be taking the

20
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,666
general test for meisters and

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,166
weapons, the Super
Written Exam.

22
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,125
I assume you have
all been studying for it.

23
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,416
[Maka thinks] Of course...!

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,333
I've been cramming for
this for a month now.

25
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,375
Just to warn you,

26
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,250
I wrote the test
questions this year.

27
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,291
If you've studied the materials,
you should be fine.

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,958
If not, you may
have a problem.

29
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,666
In either case, good luck.

30
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,875
Kay! Class is dismissed!

31
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,125
Ugh... yuck...

32
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,708
There's gotta be
some short-cut way

33
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,958
to memorize everything.

34
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't learn by
taking short cuts, Soul...

35
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,458
and I'm not gonna let you
get away with cheating, either.

36
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,500
[Harvar] Think you'll get top
score again this year, Ox?

37
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,250
Well... we'll see.

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,666
[Maka thinks]
Yeah... Last year,

39
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,791
I would've had the highest
score if it wasn't for Ox.

40
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,750
There are a couple of
hard workers in this class

41
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
who could beat out my score...

42
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,833
Like her...

43
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,458
Last year Maka came in second...
right behind me.

44
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,916
Yo, Black Star,
do you know why they

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,375
call this test the
Super Written Exam?

46
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,458
It's because supposedly
whoever comes in first

47
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,666
is destined to make
a Death Scythe.

48
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,583
What, seriously!?

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,625
[Maka] That's right.
It's my destiny...

50
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,708
Mama was at the
top of her year too...

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,250
I have to come in first...

52
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,583
It's in my blood.

53
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
It's settled! I'm gonna get

54
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,625
first and turn you into
a Death Scythe, Tsubaki.

55
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,083
Okay!

56
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,916
Way cool! This is our
first written exam ever!

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,375
Let's go!

58
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,000
Just because they put the
word 'super' in front of it

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,708
doesn't mean I'm going to study.

60
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,041
You sound pretty confident.

61
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,750
You aren't going to
prepare for it at all?

62
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,000
I am a reaper.

63
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,375
I've got a pretty good
grasp of phasmology. 

64
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,666
[Maka] I forgot...

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,166
I'll have to compete
against Kid this year too.

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,541
This could get real ugly.

67
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,750
What on earth
are you doing, Spirit?

68
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,958
I'm sending positive energy to

69
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,375
Maka so she'll do
well on the test.

70
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,041
O, kay...

71
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,375
Anything else?

72
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,375
[Stein]
No, continue.

73
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:12,416
Yeah! Maka!

[Maka]
The Super Written Exam...

75
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,666
Heart-pounding, Reeling,
and Restless, You're Kidding?

76

'Kay...! It's time to study!

00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,791
Hey, so Maka...are tests
like this a lot of fun to take?

78
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,208
Uh-huh...

79
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,083
You get to find out how
much you've learned so far...

80
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,541
You can tell from your
score and class ranking

81
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,000
It's kinda like
a game, almost...

82
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,416
But I have to study
extra hard this time...

83
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,333
They say that whoever
gets the top score will

84
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,833
create a Death Scythe.

85
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,500
From what I hear it's
really difficult to

86
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,958
become a Death Scythe...

87
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,958
Your Papa must be amazing, Maka.

88
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,708
It's my mom who's amazing. 

89
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,250
She managed to make
my good-for-nothing

90
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,541
Papa into a Death Scythe.

91
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
[Soul]
Okay, so the study of

92
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,541
phasmology
began with, who again?

93
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,708
Oh, you're studying for

94
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,750
this Super Written
test-thingy too, Soul?

95
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,583
Yeah. I'm a little busy here...

96
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,625
Leave me alone.

97
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,083
That's no fun...

98
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,375
I'm bored...! Play with me!

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,458
I'll kill her.

Five hundred.

103
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,041
The next time
I get one wrong,

104
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,958
it's gonna be a
thousand sit-ups.

105
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,625
'Kay, let's see...

You look so smart, Sis!

113

Oh my... so you

about hitting the books, huh?

116
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,750
If you guys need
help with anything--

117
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,625
Um...

118
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,875
That doesn't look like studying.

119
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,541
It's break time right now.

120
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,000
I've got this one hair
that's longer than the others.

121
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,166
I can't concentrate
because it's bothering me.

122
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,125
Idiot! What do you
think you're doing...?!

123
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,375
Eyebrow grooming is to
be left up to me!

124
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,625
What happens if the left
and right sides are uneven?!

125
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,333
Kid, do you remember
how long it took the

126
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,625
last time I let you
pluck them for me...?

127
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,875
It was a month!

128
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,291
Fine then, I promise to
do it quicker this time.

129
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,625
Please...! I beg you...!

130

Huh...? Huh?

If you're going to
keep begging me...

Go somewhere else.
We're trying to study.

What concept should I go for...?

136
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,666
Strong and yet subtle, maybe?

137
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,291
Yes, that's perfect.

138
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,375

That test must be
a really big deal.

A relaxing bath...

145

Just what I needed.

I'm so proud of Black Star
for studying this hard.

I never thought
I'd see the day.

00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,416
I told you, we're on a break.

165
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,750
You've been on
break for three days now!

166
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,833
My nails weren't painted.
It was bothering me.

167
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,166
[Soul]
All done.

168
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,291
I'm finished.

169
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,750
I've done all
that I can tonight... 

170
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,625
Now it's time to
rest up for tomorrow.

171
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,875
My little girl will get
first place tomorrow.

172
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,958
She will. She will.
She will. She will...

173
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,916
Maka. Maka. Maka.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,958
She will. She will.

175
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,625
Maka will get first
place tomorrow!

176
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,458
Maka. Maka. Maka. 

177
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,458
I will do my best tomorrow...

178
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,750
I'm ready!

179
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,208
[Blair cheers]

180
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll be proctoring
your exam today...

181
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,250
just one more thing
before we get started... 

182
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,375
Ya... hoo...

183
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,791
It's Black Star!

184
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,291
A certain idiot decided
to sneak into Professor Stein's

185
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,750
laboratory last night
to steal the exam.

186
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,458
Ya... hoo...

187
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,583
So... don't be an
idiot like this guy.

188
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,291
You'll have sixty minutes.

189
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,791
Keep your eyes
on your own paper.

190
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,666
La la la la...

191
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,791
Start writing!

192
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,125
[Maka thinks] You're fine...
just relax.

193
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,166
[Soul thinks] Anyone who spends
all that time studying to

194
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,291
do this honestly is a chump...

195
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,583
I prefer to work
smart instead of hard...

196
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,541
That's why I look for shortcuts.

197
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,333
The highest score on
this test wins no matter what, 

198
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,375
so who cares how you get it.

199
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,250
My entire body is
covered in cheat sheets.

200
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:40,208
How's this for a shortcut Maka?

201
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,208
I'm gonna ace this thing,
no problem.

202
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,458
You sure this 
everything you have?

203
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,125
Why...? You wanna take
my underwear, too?!

204
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,708
[Maka thinks]
What an idiot.

205
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,041
[Sid]
Go back to your seat...

206
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,583
But this is the only other
chance you're gonna get.

207
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,041
Yeah, yeah.

208
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,958
[classmates laugh]

209
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,958
[Maka thinks] No, I need to
concentrate on my test.

210
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,916
Looks like the next
few are fill-in-the-blank.

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,833
Let's see...
"Complete the following

212
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,291
sentences as
accurately as you can"...

213
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,708
One: A sound soul...

214
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,958
Easy...!

215
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,916
Dwells within a... sound...

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,375
[Liz] Okay. A sound soul
dwells within sound skin

217
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,125
and sound cuticles.

218
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,416
[Liz thinks] That
doesn't sound right.

219
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
[Soul thinks]
I hadn't even answered

220
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,916
a single question yet...

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,500
This is the opposite of cool.

222
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,000
Wait...!
Maybe I'm not done for...

223
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,708
The brilliant Kid is
sitting right next to me!

224
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,041
Awful!

225
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,125
[Kid cries out]

226
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,750
[Kid]
It's not neat enough.

227
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,708
[Soul thinks] The freak's
still writing his name...!

228
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,416
He's useless.

229
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,250
And here?

230
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,291
She's writing with a crayon?!

231
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,125
[Soul] She's worn down
the yellow quite a lot.

232
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,583
[Patty laughs and sings]

233
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,541
Giraffe...! Giraffe!

234
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,041
I love Giraffes...

235
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
[Soul]
Of course. A giraffe.

236
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,916
[Maka] "Answer this
question true or false."

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,916
Uh-huh! It's just
like Professor Stein

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,875
to throw in a trick
question to trip us up.

239
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,958
[Tsubaki thinks]
Is this a trick...?

240
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,708
No, it couldn't be...

241
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,583
Professor Stein wouldn't do
anything to trick his students.

242
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,000
[Maka thinks]
False!

243
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,166
You can't fool me with
that little trick, Professor!

244
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,666
[Ox]
Excuse me, Sid...

245
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm all finished.

246
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,500
[Sid] Just read a
book or something.

247
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,500
[Liz]
Know it all brat.

248
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,541
Ten minutes remaining.

249
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,625
[Soul thinks] What!...?
I'm running out of time!

250
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,583
And Kid's still
trying to write his name.

251
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,916
[Patty]
All done!

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,625
What!?

253
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,666
Woo-hoo! It's so pretty!

254
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,958
[Soul thinks] She made
her test into a giraffe.

255
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,000
Better watch out...!

256
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,375
I can break your neck!

257
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,666
[Soul thinks]
That's pretty good.

258
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,750
Damn... it's awful.
Just... awful!

259
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,625
No matter what I do,
I can't get the 'k' right.

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,583
I'm useless garbage!

261
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,958
I'm a horrible, disgusting

262
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,875
person who doesn't
deserve to live another day.

263
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,416
Uh Sid... Kid just collapsed.

264
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,291
Let him be.

265
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,000
[Black Star]
Soul...

266
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,833
[Soul thinks]
Black Star!

267
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,625
You're writing... In blood?

268
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,958
That's right... You saw
the answers in the laboratory...

269
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,625
...and now you're
trying to give them to me.

270
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,458
I'll carry out
your dying wish...

271
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,125
I promise I will!

272
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,500
What good is
your stupid autograph?!

273
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,708
You choose: be quiet or die...

274
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,583
Test is almost over!

275
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,791
[Maka thinks] All right.
I've checked everything...

276
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,666
It looks good.

277
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,208
You have ten seconds.

278
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,666
[Maka thinks]
Yes...

279
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,166
[Sid]
Five seconds left!

280
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,041
[Maka thinks]
It's all perfect.

281
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,291
Test is over!

282
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,666
Victory! 

283
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,166
Victory!

284
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,083
It's...over.

285
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,541
No...

286
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,416
[Patty] I got you now,
giraffe! Yes I do!

287
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:27,916
[Soul] It's been over since
I got strip searched.

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,541
[Student A]
Man... am I worn out.

289
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,375
[Student B] I know. That was
a tough one, huh?

290
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,791
[Student C] Yeah,
I think it was too hard.

291
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,250
[Student A]
I second that!

292
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,041
Come on. You gotta be
kidding me with this, Maka...

293
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,666
The test is all over...

294
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,208
And you're still studying?

295
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,625
No, no...

296
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,708
I made a mess while
I was studying earlier,

297
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,750
and when I was cleaning up,

298
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,791
I found this old photo album. 

299
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,458
[Soul] Is that you with
your creepy dad?

300
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,666
He's so young!

301
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,000
[Maka] Uh-huh...

302
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,750
Papa was only eighteen
years old when I was born.

303
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,916
He used to read a lot
of books to me back then.

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,791
[Soul]
Huh...

305
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,041
You think your old man's

306
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,875
the reason you love to
read books so much now?

307
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,791
Maybe he is.

308
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,750
[cork popping]
[Blair and Death Scythe] Yea!

309
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,625
Congratulations, Papa...!

310
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,000
The results of the Super
Test-thingy have been posted.

311
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,791
That's something a
man can drink to!

312
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,750
I think it's great that
you spent three days

313
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,708
straight sending out
positive energy for Maka!

314
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,041
Maka sure is amazing huh...

315
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,708
...at the very top of her class,
just like my wife was.

316
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,625
You mean your ex-wife.

317
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, my ex...

318
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,791
Listen, Blair...
can I ask you a favor?

319
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,625
Meow...

320
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,875
I wanted to get Maka

321
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,625
a present to congratulate
her on the test...

322
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,375
Could you casually find
out what her favorite book

323
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,000
is and buy it for her...?

324
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,166
Here, here's some money

325
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,041
for the book and a
letter from me to Maka.

326
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,333
Shouldn't you give
it to her yourself, Papa?

327
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,291
No, if I tried to give
it to her directly,

328
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,625
there's a good chance
she wouldn't accept it.

329
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,250
Why are you laughing?

330
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,458
It's nothing.

331
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,333
I can just tell that
you really love Maka.

332
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,416
If it's a book you want,
then consider it done.

333
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,250
Thank you Blair.

334
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,250
Oh, no...! I went and spent
the money on myself instead. 

335
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,416
I couldn't resist
the temptation!

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,791
I'm used to being the one
who's doing the tempting...

337
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,541
Now I'm nothing
but a dirty cat burglar. 

338
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,583
All I have to do is
shrink it a little,

339
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,125
and it'll be perfect...!

340
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,000
Pum-pum-pumpkin, pum pumpkin!

341
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,166
Now drop the
card inside, and done!

342
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,958
I'm home, Maka!

343
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,583
Hey... Welcome back.

344
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,333
There's pumpkin pie
if you're hungry.

345
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,291
[Blair]
Sounds good!

346
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,500
Here, Maka. I have a
present for you from your Papa.

347
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,083
It's to celebrate
your good test score.

348
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,333
What could it be?

349
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,833
Ta-da!

350
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,291
What could that
creep possibly be thinking,

351
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,500
sending sexy underwear
to his own daughter?!

352
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,041
Hold on, Maka... Um...

353
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,250
I think there's a card in here
that supposed to go with it.

354
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,750
Oh, great.

355
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,750
[Death Scythe]
Congratulations...!

356
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,458
I know you worked hard to
get such a high score.

357
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,708
That's why I'm sending
you this present.

358
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,416
I hope you can use it to
relax and have a little fun...

359
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,791
You've earned it...! From, Papa.

360
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,291
[Maka] What kind of
"fun" does he mean?

361
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,708
Just what kind of
girl does he think I am?

362
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,583
I'll bet Maka's enjoying
her present right now.

363
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,166
He's so... creepy!

364
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,916
I hate him.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,166

[Black Star]
The test is over!

368
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:14,958
[Maka]
No, it's not...

369
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,458
You still have to
take a make-up exam.

370
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,833
[Black Star] That
test is in the past...!

371
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,875
Truly big stars only
look into the future!

372
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,958
[Maka] Okay, well, the make-up
exam is in the future,

373
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,166
not the past.

374
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,041
[Black Star] What are
you trying to do,

375
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,166
trip me up with fancy language?

376
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,333
[Maka]
I'm not tripping you up;

377
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,791
I'm just tellin' it like it is.

378
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,750
[Black Star] Okay, fine. But
what am I supposed to do?

379
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:30,833
[Maka]
Try studying.

380
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,083
[Black Star]
Oh yeah that.

381
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,916
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

382
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,666
The Soul-eating Black Dragon...

383

Scaredy-cat Liz
and Her Merry Friends?

384
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,708
[Maka]
Watch it...

385
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,083
...or I'll take your soul!
