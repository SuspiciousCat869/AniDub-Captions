1
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,216
There's no reason
to be surprised.

2
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,676
This was expected...

3
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,388
It's only natural that I am
the one still standing...

4
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:08,600
And they're the ones who
fell before me like insects ...

5
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:12,145
You're fools if you
expected something else.

6
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:14,105
Welcome to harsh
reality, children.

7
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,316
There are no surprises here.

8
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:17,817
Also...

9
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:20,695
...there is no fear.

10
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,115
A sound soul...

11
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,077
Dwells within a sound mind...

12
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,538
And a sound body.

13
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,548
Kishin Asura...

14
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,550
I hope you're ready...

15
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:44,302
Your soul is mine!

16
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:46,554
You're a persistent
one, aren't you...?

17
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:51,017
Returning to sanity after being
devoured by the black blood.

18
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:57,565
What's wrong?
You're trembling.

19
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:58,775
Are you afraid...?

20
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:02,529
Oh yes.
I think you're terrified.

21
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:09,035
Everything wrong in this
world is rooted in fear...

22
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,453
Frustration...

23
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:11,788
...failure...

24
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,206
...betrayal...

25
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,791
...anger...

26
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,501
...tragedy...

27
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,545
...and, of course...

28
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:20,672
Utter defeat.

29
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:22,132
Stop talking.

30
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:25,927
You don't have to hide it.
Poor girl.

31
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,595
Shut up!

32
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,597
Yelling won't get
you anywhere...

33
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,850
I'm not afraid of you.

34
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:35,186
But you are very
afraid of me, indeed...

35
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,149
Thanks to that,
I'll win this battle easily.

36
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,278
Say whatever you want...
It won't change anything.

37
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:47,490
She isn't shaking now...
She's ready to face him.

38
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,784
I am going to fight you.

39
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:51,953
And I'll win!

40
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:54,247
Let's do this!

41
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:57,959
Let's go!
Soul Resonance!

42
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,975
The Kishin hasn't
made a move yet.

43
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,519
Find your chance
and hit him hard!

44
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,235
You're so weak.

45
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,990
My final opponent,

46
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,242
and you're nothing more
than a pathetic little girl...

47
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,536
What a shame.

48
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,206
Maka...!
Get up now!

49
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,917
Your little friends were
so much stronger than you.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,461
And look at how they ended up.

51
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,046
Move, Maka!

52
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,805
You're getting up...?

53
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:55,684
I think I prefer
you on the ground.

54
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,562
That position suits a
little weakling like you...

55
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:02,065
...but I can kill
you standing, too.

56
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,109
Can you make it?

57
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,403
Of course I can.
Let's go!

58
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,197
If this lasts too
long, I'll lose.

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,992
I have to find an opening
and strike as hard as I can...

60
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,869
Only one thing will work.

61
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:18,164
She's right.
We can only use one technique...

62
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,874
And that's...

63
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:27,048
Genie Hunter.

64
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,718
The Anti-Magic Wavelength...

65
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,345
An incredibly powerful
move handed down

66
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:34,347
to her from her mother.

67
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,808
The force that can erase evil...

68
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:40,395
...removing impurities
until only good remains.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,860
Here she comes.

70
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,695
She's fighting the Kishin.

71
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,363
He's no ordinary opponent.

72
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:52,824
He won't be beaten so easily.

73
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:54,492
Damn it...

74
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,078
My daughter's down
there risking her life...

75
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,164
...and I can't do anything.

76
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,541
Maka...

77
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,084
Please...

78
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,545
...come back to me alive.

79
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,638
Now is our chance.

80
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:20,393
This is it, Maka.
Let's go!

81
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:31,029
Kishin Hunter!

82
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:41,122
A move that targets evil...

83
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:44,584
But let me ask you one thing...

84
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,003
Am I truly evil?

85
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:51,257
If you think I am, you're wrong.

86
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,225
The madness within
me that frightens

87
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:03,019
you so much isn't evil.

88
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,813
It's normal...

89
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,231
Everybody in this world has

90
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,983
a trace of insanity
resting within them...

91
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,026
Even you...

92
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,696
...madness makes no exceptions.

93
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,866
Screw you.

94
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,993
What a foul mouth...

95
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,538
I'll have to punish
you for that.

96
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,548
A sweet gesture...

97
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,800
...but how futile.

98
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:42,726
Soul...

99
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,769
Are you okay?

100
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:47,731
Soul!

101
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,026
They all sacrificed
themselves for you...

102
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,446
...but in the end,
is that truly a kindness?

103
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,489
They've only moved
the responsibility

104
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:58,158
onto your shoulders...

105
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,618
They've left you
the fear of failure.

106
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:02,912
Just shut the hell up.

107
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,457
But that isn't all, is it...?

108
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,751
There's the fear of death, too.

109
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:11,087
I thought I told you
to shut the hell up!

110
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:13,423
The fear of loneliness...

111
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:15,800
We can't forget that...

112
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,469
And also...

113
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,850
The fear of pain.

114
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,812
A primitive fear, all right,
but a cruel one nonetheless...

115
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,689
Besides...

116
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:32,942
It's effective enough
against someone like you.

117
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,820
A weak little human.

118
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,990
How can we be sure
it's still going on?

119
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,993
If something had happened
to the Kishin, we'd know...

120
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,246
The barrier he established
would start to fade.

121
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,790
For now we wait...

122
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:50,877
...and trust Maka to use her
technique to destroy the Kishin.

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,754
You're... wrong.

124
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,174
That's not what she needs.

125
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,679
Maka's strength...

126
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:03,598
Doesn't come from
some technique.

127
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:09,521
Yes...
You're right.

128
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,482
I am a weak human.

129
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,027
But this pain...

130
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:19,406
I've felt worse
than this before.

131
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:23,868
Much much worse than this.

132
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,623
This pain is nothing!

133
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:31,918
Let's see how much
pain you can handle then...

134
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,170
You can dodge this...

135
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:37,716
But if you do,
your friend will die.

136
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:52,605
That should finish it.

137
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,989
Back up on your feet again, huh?

138
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,533
Well, that won't last long.

139
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,038
What the--?

140
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:19,341
Impossible!
What magic is this?

141
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,634
What did you do?!

142
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:30,352
I see.
So that's what happened!

143
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,939
This girl is a weapon.

144
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,151
No, it's something else...

145
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:41,654
She's a meister all right,
but she also has weapon blood.

146
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:49,746
Why did the weapon within
her not awake until now?

147
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,462
There's no trace of
the fear she felt before.

148
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,340
Why not?

149
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,810
Oh, now I see.

150
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:16,731
She's remaining unconscious
so she won't feel fear.

151
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,734
She summons the
weapons without knowing it.

152
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,365
Now that I understand,
I can beat her.

153
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,119
This is a trick
I know how to fight.

154
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,665
Come here, girl!

155
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:43,341
Now I gotcha.

156
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:51,182
Go on and stab me.
I'm not afraid of pain...

157
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,226
Not at all.

158
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,311
But what about you?

159
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:02,402
Time to wake up.

160
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,866
Fighting while
your mind sleeps...

161
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,826
That's not fair.

162
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,373
There we go...
That's much better.

163
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,336
That suffocating
feeling you have now...

164
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,837
...that's fear.

165
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,050
You can let go now...

166
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,551
That's enough...

167
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:28,303
Let the madness carry you away,

168
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:31,931
and you'll be free from
all fear and pain.

169
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:35,852
Let go, and everything you
feel now will evaporate.

170
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:38,855
There's nothing more
you can do here.

171
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,190
Your friends have fallen.

172
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,233
Your big move failed.

173
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,861
There's no point
in continuing now...

174
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:48,156
Everything you've
done was for nothing.

175
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,784
You have no partner
to stand beside you...

176
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:55,872
Your body is
weak--bruised and beaten.

177
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:58,291
There's nothing you can
do now to defeat me...

178
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,169
You have nothing left.

179
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,422
I have nothing...

180
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,924
...left.

181
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,803
Yes, that's right...

182
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:12,681
You have nothing,
nothing at all.

183
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,519
It'll be all right then.

184
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,567
I don't understand
what you're saying.

185
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,277
Is there something else

186
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:29,030
she can use besides the
Anti-Magic Wavelength...?

187
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,282
Some other technique?

188
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,326
Like I said...

189
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,037
Her greatest strength
isn't a technique...

190
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,415
It's something different.

191
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:40,458
Something in here.

192
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,218
Crona's right about that.

193
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,929
Look who's awake.

194
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,306
I'm back, baby!

195
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,810
And still as eloquent
as ever, I see.

196
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,980
What...?
What did you say?

197
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:07,235
Didn't you hear me?

198
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:10,655
I said it's going
to be all right.

199
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,657
What?
No it won't...!

200
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,200
Alright?!

201
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,286
The Genie Hunter isn't
what I need to defeat you.

202
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,621
How could she say that?

203
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:21,041
I went along with what
the teachers said...

204
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:23,877
I thought that move
was my only hope...

205
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,211
They were wrong...

206
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,297
That isn't my greatest power...

207
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,341
Not at all.

208
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,426
What are you saying?

209
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,928
You little fool.

210
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:37,515
Maka isn't the fool,
you jackass.

211
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:41,936
Do you all understand
what I'm talking about now?

212
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,396
Don't you get it yet...?

213
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,982
Maka may not be a
great star like I am...

214
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,610
...but she's got something
amazing, all right.

215
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,653
Maka's strength...

216
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:53,490
...isn't some special ability...

217
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,325
It's more.

218
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:58,661
It's something...
that can beat fear.

219
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:01,164
It's bravery!

220
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:04,042
That's all?
Bravery?

221
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,961
I don't understand you people.

222
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:11,758
You put faith in something as
fragile as one girl's bravery?

223
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:18,098
Stop it!
Don't look at me like that!

224
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:21,976
How can you be so
calm at a time like this?!

225
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,814
What's happening...?!
Who the hell are you?!

226
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:28,692
I'm academy
student Maka Albarn...

227
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,902
One star scythe meister.

228
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,612
Not what I meant...!

229
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,781
I'm not asking
you your name...!

230
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:36,658
You're standing
there so calmly...

231
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:39,619
That's not normal!
What are you?!

232
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:44,207
I'm just me...
Nothing more and nothing less.

233
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,459
She's making me nervous.

234
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,336
But I don't understand
why that is.

235
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,380
I'm so confused!

236
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,132
It's like the feeling you
get when you wake up

237
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:55,301
from a bad dream you
can't remember.

238
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:57,971
I've had enough of this.

239
00:14:58,054 --> 00:14:59,514
You have to die now...

240
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:02,809
I'm going to kill
all of you...!

241
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:05,270
I don't have any other choice!

242
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,273
Shujaat...

243
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:12,360
What...?
What is that?

244
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,572
A postcard...
with a message.

245
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:18,533
But that doesn't matter...

246
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,326
It's none of your business.

247
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,579
None of my business?!

248
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:24,998
How can you talk
to me like that?!

249
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:28,376
You insolent--Oh no...

250
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,670
Whatever you're doing, stop!

251
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,298
No...
I won't.

252
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,052
I've come too far to stop now.

253
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:40,096
If I gave up, how could I
face the people who've

254
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,892
stood by me, supported
me for so long?

255
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,852
They're the reason I'm here.

256
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,229
They lent me their courage.

257
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,485
Now it's time to use my own.

258
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,613
It's time for me to
be brave for them.

259
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,115
That's ridiculous...

260
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,494
You don't know what
you're talking about!

261
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:07,040
Bravery is my armor...
and this is my weapon.

262
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,669
Fool!

263
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,713
You really think that pitiful
little fist will hurt me...?!

264
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:15,090
You'll accomplish nothing...!

265
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:17,801
Why can't you see how
useless it is to try...?

266
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,804
You should have given this
fight up a long time ago!

267
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,016
I don't understand
anything that's going on!

268
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,697
I don't get it.

269
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,000
Why do you have
so much faith in her?

270
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,961
She's weak...

271
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,464
She isn't special...

272
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,136
She's nothing more than a human.

273
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,599
What is bravery?

274
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:22,198
Kishin are you ready...?
I'm coming!

275
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:26,911
Go away!!

276
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,420
What's the point
in destroying me?

277
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:39,466
Madness won't disappear
just because I'm gone!

278
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,010
Another one will take my place!

279
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,180
There will be a new Kishin.
An heir to my madness...!

280
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:49,309
He will rain insanity upon
the world just as I have done!

281
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:52,103
That's the way this
world will always be!

282
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,814
Why can't you see
your struggle is pointless?!

283
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,399
I don't care!

284
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:59,194
Stay away!!

285
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:02,489
I will defeat you!

286
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,671
You didn't even scratch me...

287
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,464
Your fist wasn't
enough after all...

288
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:21,049
...you fool!

289
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,801
There's no way a
weak, talentless

290
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,135
little human like
you could beat me.

291
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,346
You didn't stand a chance!

292
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:36,272
What is this...?!
You just punched me.

293
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:39,484
Your fist isn't a weapon.
It's nothing special!

294
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:43,196
Exactly...
bravery's not special.

295
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:47,909
But that means...
everybody has it.

296
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:50,912
Everybody, huh?

297
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:54,666
Then it's just like madness.

298
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:07,429
The barrier's gone.

299
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,055
They did it?

300
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:10,348
Fool...!

301
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,850
Take a look.

302
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,311
Where's Maka?

303
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,896
Don't worry...

304
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,735
My Maka's too strong
to be defeated.

305
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:32,078
Finally...
It looks like it's over at last.

306
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,836
You did it, Maka.

307
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,547
You really are amazing...

308
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,299
Coolest partner ever.

309
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:46,926
The sky's all pretty now!

310
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,011
Well done.

311
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,096
We defeated the Kishin
and bad weather!

312
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,056
How bout that!

313
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,932
Ha! We win!
We win!

314
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,100
The sky's blue!

315
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:54,976
I surpassed god and
a cyoom-u-lo-nimbus!

316
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,812
Are you okay, Soul?

317
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,856
Well, we finally did it.

318
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:02,317
But there's still a lot
of work ahead of us.

319
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,405
Yeah, like rebuilding Death City
and repairing the academy.

320
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,366
Well... at least
we can celebrate

321
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,034
that the Kishin's
gone now, right?

322
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,119
We can't be too happy.

323
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,122
People still
inhabit this world...

324
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:19,459
...there will always be
more evil to face.

325
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,879
We were able to scrape through
this time because of Maka...

326
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:26,257
But sooner or later
another Kishin will rise up.

327
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,176
It'll be okay.

328
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,181
When it does come,
we'll be there...

329
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,683
