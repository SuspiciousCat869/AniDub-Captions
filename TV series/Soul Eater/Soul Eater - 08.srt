00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,000
actually be able to do
some internal damage.

But how is that even possible?

130

a Demon Sword is created...

132
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,833
We have to stop him
here and now...

133
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,125
...or he will definitely
become a Kishin...

134
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,500
What's more...

135
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,750
...the balance of power
between these two is uneven.

136
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,000
[Stein] The weapon's soul
is clearly dominant...

137
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,333
It rules over the meister's
more introverted soul,

138
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,666
confining it.

139
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,500
For the moment...
the meister still has

140
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,250
some strength left to fight
back against the weapon.

141
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,166
But if he should be
completely swallowed up,

142
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,000
things will get dangerous.

143
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,708
[Stein]
There's something else.

144
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,375
I see a snake
coiled around him.

145
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,083
What's it doing there?

146
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,208
[Ragnarok] If you let him hit
you with that technique again,

147
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,875
I'm going to stick thumbtacks
in your shoes. Got it?

148
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,625
No-oo...! Thumbtacks in my
shoes would stick into

149
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,291
my feet whenever
I tried to walk.

150
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,541
It would hurt,

151
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,041
I don't think I could
deal with that, really.

152
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,333
Oh, I see...

153
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,458
Professor Stein has a
specific fighting style.

154
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,708
First, he guards, using my
dad only as a shield.

155
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,666
Then he uses his own attack.

156
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,541
[Stein]
Soul Force!

157

[Maka]

I think I'd like
to dissect you now.

[Ragnarok] (Begyaaaah!)...
screw yourself!

165
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,041
You won't live that long!

166
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,958
You ready?

167
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,416
Yep!

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,958
[Ragnarok]
Bloody Needle!

169
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,916
[Stein]
Spirit Body!

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,583
[Spirit Body] Oh dear...
I think this is too much for me!

171
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,750
[Ragnarok]
(Goobee)...

172
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,541
...let's see you
stop all of these!

173
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,708
[Ragnarok] Where'd the
screw-head freak go?

174
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:47,708
I don't see him...

175
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,458
Where the hell is he, damn it?!

176
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,958
[Ragnarok] Damn!
He scrambled what

177
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,083
little brains you have left!

178
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,500
Hurry up and snap out of it!

179
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,041
We can't afford another
hit from his soul wavelength.

180
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,791
There are stars and planets
floating around me...

181
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,166
I don't think I can
handle astronomy right now.

182
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,333
[Ragnarok] Astronomy's a lot
easier to deal with than death,

183
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,583
you moron...!

184
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,041
So suck it up and come
to your senses already!

185
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,500
Double-Palm Soul Force...!

186
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,375
Twin Spears!

187
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,458
[Ragnarok and Crona cry out]

188
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,041
The needles again?

189
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,833
No... it's over now...

190
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,583
I hate to say it,
but you're finished.

191
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,791
[Medusa]
So much for round one...

192
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,958
It looks like I'll have some
more experimenting to do.

193
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,500
[Crona screams suddenly]

194
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,916
[Crona and Ragnarok
scream in unison]

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,875
What's happening to him?

196
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,208
[Stein] He's going through
soul rejection.

197
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,125
[Maka] Their soul wavelengths
were united but they're

198
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,083
falling apart now.

199
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,375
[Medusa] I guess
I found his limit.

200
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh well,
Soul Protect... Release.

201
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,583
It's another soul...

202
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,416
I don't know where it
came from, but I can sense it.

203
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
I feel it too...

204
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,875
It's a witch.

205
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,125
[Medusa chuckles
and then laughs]

206
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,500
[power surges]

207
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,166
A witch, huh?

208
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes, and one with a
strong soul... Very powerful.

209
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,000
[Stein] My guess is she's the
one who put that weapon

210
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,625
inside the kid's body, too.

211
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,958
[Maka] That's the
witch's soul up there?

212
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,500
But how? I should have

213
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,666
felt a soul like that
before now...

214
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,666
It's incredibly strong.

215
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,708
[Stein]
Soul Protect.

216
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,541
[Maka]
What is that?

217
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,208
[Stein]
It's advanced magic...

218
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,541
Not all witches can use it.

219
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,875
The technique encloses the

220
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,625
area around the
soul with magic.

221
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,625
This blocks the
soul's wavelength.

222
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,000
The witch is camouflaged,

223
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,083
and her soul appears to be
that of a normal human.

224
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,666
So that's the soul
of a real witch...?

225
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,500
Mama defeated
something like that...

226
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,500
in order to turn
Papa into a Death Scythe?

227
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,750
[Medusa]
Pathetic...

228
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,875
Crona is such a weakling.

229
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,916
I'll have to punish him later.

230
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,416
[Medusa]
Nake Snake...

231
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,166
Cobra... Cobra...

232
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,250
Nake... Snake...

233
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,416
Cobra Cobra.

234
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,750
But before I go,
I'll punish you too.

235
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,166
Won't that be fun?

236
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,041
[Medusa]
Vector Arrows!

237
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,166
Let's go! Soul Resonance!

238
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,583
Witch Hunter!

239
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,125
Quite impressive.

240
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,833
[Medusa chuckles evilly]

241
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
[Medusa] I just dropped
by on a little errand...

242
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,875
Who would have thought

243
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,291
I'd run into the
DWMA's legendary meister?

244
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,583
And Death Scythe, too...!

245
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,708
What an unexpected pleasure.

246
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,291
I would love to stay and play
with you kids a little longer.

247
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,791
But I'm afraid I can't...

248
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,083
Perhaps we can
all play another time.

249
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,583
[Death Scythe]
Hold it, lady!

250
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,666
[Stein]
No... It's okay.

251
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,541
Let's leave her for now...

252
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,083
I'm more worried about Soul.

253
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,083
[Maka thinks]
Soul.

254
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
Papa.

255
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,208
[Death Scythe]
Come on...

256
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,583
Let's go home, Maka.

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,625
[bells tolling]

258
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,875
[Death]
Interesting...

259
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,375
Those two had a
pretty rough time, it seems...

260
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,875
How is Soul holding up?

261
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,708
[Death Scythe]
Stein is operating on him now...

262
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,708
He was hurt pretty bad,
but I think he'll be all right.

263
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,458
[Death] The Demon
Sword has surfaced...

264
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,166
And it's united
with a meister...

265
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,750
..actually embedded within him,

266
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,000
from what you say...

267
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,041
And behind it all
is a powerful witch.

268
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,500
Hmm...

269
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,500
[Death]
Goodness! It looks like

270
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,250
things are getting pretty
crazy around here,

271
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,333
aren't they?

272
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,666
[Death Scythe] Uh...
Lord Death...

273
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,875
Don't you think you

274
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,500
might be taking this
a little too lightly?

275
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,166
[Death]
Oh?

276
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,166
[Girl A] How was your
extra credit lesson?

277
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,625
[Girl B] All in all, it went
pretty well, I guess.

278
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,708
[Girl C] Ugh... You're lucky.

279
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,000
I have a remedial
lesson tomorrow.

280
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,375
[Girl A] Personally I'd rather
have a remedial lesson.

281
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,833
Didn't you hear...?

282
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,416
Apparently a one-star kid
named Soul Eater got injured

283
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,958
and had to be
brought back for surgery.

284
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,833
[Girl C] You're kidding!
I hope he's all right!

285
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,333
What? Something
happened to Soul?

286
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,375
Professor Stein?

287
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,791
Have you been waiting
out here this whole time...?

288
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,416
Why didn't you go take
a nap or eat or something?

289
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,333
I need to know
how Soul is!

290
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,791
[Stein]
Uhh...

291
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,250
The operation was a
complete success.

292
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,541
Once he rests up a little bit,
he'll be as good as new!

293
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,208
He's okay!

294
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,625
Thank you so much, Professor!

295
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,833
[Maka]
Umm...

296
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:03,291
Would it be all right if I went
in to check on him now?

297
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,375
Sure... That'll be fine.

298
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,250
Thank you!

299
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,333
[Death Scythe] That's a nice
fake  smile you're wearing.

300
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,666
[Death Scythe]  So tell me what
you wouldn't tell Maka...

301
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,083
What is Soul's condition really?

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,416
[Stein] The wound itself is
all right after surgery.

303
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,833
That much I can say, at least.

304
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,041
But, there is still
something that bothers me.

305
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,458
[Death Scythe]
Go on.

306
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,625
[Stein] I'm not exactly certain,
but it might be a curse.

307
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,041
A curse...?

308
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,666
What kind of curse is it...?

309
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,291
Will he be all right?

310
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,083
The Demon Sword,
Ragnarok has black blood...

311
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,208
Some of it appears to

312
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,458
have gotten mixed
into Soul's blood...

313
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,833
I can't say for sure
how it will affect him,

314
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,375
but I doubt it will be good.

315
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,750
[Maka thinks]
Soul.

316
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,375
Back away...

317
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,125
I won't let you
touch my meister...

318
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,833
[Maka thinks with a shaky
internal voice] I'm sorry.

319
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,583
I am your weapon
partner, Maka...

320
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,833
That means I am always
prepared to die for my meister.

321
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,750
[Maka]
You did it all for me.

322
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,666
Just you wait...!

323

Can you do me a favor and
help me out with your father...?

Yes... I'm sorry...

356

It's all my fault
that he was hurt.

But he's okay now.
