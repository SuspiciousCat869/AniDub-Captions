167
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,712
You too, Crona...

168
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:06,591
The child of Medusa...
my little sister.

169
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:10,845
How delightful...

170
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,349
Medusa didn't love you
one little bit, did she...?

171
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,351
Well...
It's not too late.

172
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,228
I can give you my love.

173
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:27,404
[Arachne laughs softly
and slowly builds]

174
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,531
Oh, how delightful!

175
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,616
[Crona seethes]

176
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,495
[Ragnarok]
Go after her, Crona!

177
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:36,621
Kill the witch!

178
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,331
We're on fire now!

179
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,376
A close call...!

180
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,627
But I guess I have aged

181
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:45,296
a bit in these last
eight hundred years.

182
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,969
I'm no longer delighted...

183
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,346
Exterminate the brat, Giriko.

184
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,056
Sure thing.

185
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,195
No way...! He broke through

186
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,740
the black blood
with just one kick?

187
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,742
My trusty Saw Leg...

188
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:14,909
Looks like speed setting

189
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,287
two is enough to
take care of this brat.

190
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,291
I guess Medusa's research
was nothing special after all.

191
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:22,542
Cuts like that are nothing...!

192
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,877
I'll just harden
the black blood.

193
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,379
After you say, thank you!

194
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,297
Thank you.

195
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,132
You mean 'thanks very much!'

196
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:31,634
They're stronger than I thought.

197
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:35,388
I guess I'll just hafta cut 'em
in half and eat their souls.

198
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:36,139
Stop it...!

199
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,223
When you squat it looks

200
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,559
like you're going
to the bathroom.

201
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:44,064
Now we're talking!

202
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,901
Say goodbye, brat!

203
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,819
Time to die!

204
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,530
Nice try!

205
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,699
Saint Cross Knife!

206
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,959
[Giriko]
Who the hell're you?!

207
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,462
[Soul]
His arm's a guillotine?

208
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,006
So who won?

209
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,841
[Giriko]
Damn, that was close...

210
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,469
That guy almost got me.

211
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:15,637
It's a good thing I had my

212
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,807
chains ready or else
I'd be dead by now.

213
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,266
Quite impressive...

214
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,018
Who are you, anyway?

215
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,104
[music playing in headphones]

216
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:29,943
Too good to answer me, are you?

217
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:32,904
[Arachne]
Justin Law.

218
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,615
He's one of the Death Scythes.

219
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,826
This guy is a Death Scythe...?

220
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,202
You're kidding me.

221
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,287
Is he?

222
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,372
The Executioner.

223
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,374
He's a legend at the academy.

224
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,377
Four years ago, when he
was only thirteen,

225
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,005
he became the youngest boy
ever in academy history

226
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,090
to reach the level
of Death Scythe...

227
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:53,842
He did it all by himself, too...

228
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:56,720
...with no meister
partner or anything.

229
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,931
Oh, Lord Death...

230
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,642
Please grant me strength.

231
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,853
Attention, DWMA students...!

232
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,271
As there is only one opponent,

233
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:07,564
I will end this quickly...

234
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:08,606
Please wait a moment,

235
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,775
if you don't mind!

236
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,235
Damn, he's loud!

237
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,738
Because of the earphones, maybe?

238
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:18,908
Another weapon like me
who doesn't need a meister...?

239
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:21,161
I don't like that very much.

240
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,165
[Giriko] Do you have fun
sucking up to Death, boy...?

241
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,083
Is it worth it?

242
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,342
They've both got such
strong wavelengths...

243
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,260
They might be equals.

244
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:43,391
What is it?

245
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,352
A scythe...

246
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,937
He's the same kind
of weapon I am.

247
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:51,566
You wanna know something
that really pisses me off?

248
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:55,528
Bootlicking suck ups like you!

249
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,239

has housebroken!

Don't you even want to
hear about the heretic witch?

They're on such a
different level than us...!

00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,356
I can't learn
anything from this.

What? Are you trying
to study right now...?!

259

Damn, you're a strange girl.

260
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,534
Now I've got
my engine running...

261
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,994
Why don't you take off the
damn earphones already...?

262
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,913
You're not listening to a
single word I'm saying,

263
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:48,498
you cocky bastard.

264
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:50,000
Huh?

265
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,335
I can read your lips.

00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,753
I don't have to hear you...

267
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,839
Such a filthy mouth...

268
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:57,757
Quite shocking.

269
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,511
You've been reading my
lips this whole time...?

270
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:04,723
So you purposefully pretended
that you couldn't hear me...?

271
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,433
Now you're really
pissing me off!

What d'ya want, lady?!

274
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,897
I detest children who shout.

275
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,858
Shouldn't you know that by now?

276
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:16,568
How can I help you, ma'am?

277
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,987
The golem's energy is
just about drained...

278
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,281
It's time for us
to begin our retreat.

279
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:22,782
Retreat?

280
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,909
[Arachne] Someone
is waiting for us...

281
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:26,327
But don't worry...

282
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:29,456
You'll have plenty of
opportunities to fight later.

283
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,002
There's no choice then...

284
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,879
The rest is up to you, golem...

285
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:39,549
I couldn't care less
about those brats.

286
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:42,052
They'll die soon enough.

00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,846

Lord Death's express
instructions were

293
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,485
to secure the academy students

294
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,487
and the trial student
who's with them.

295

Everyone, please duck down...

296
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,908
I'm going to take care of this.

who dwells within
the city of death...

00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:12,957
May thy name be kept true.

300
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,002
The prayer is increasing the
strength of his soul wavelength.

301

[Justin]
Oh Lord of Death...

00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:20,507
I am your servant of peace...

I am a pillar of justice.

00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,179
I am a blade of faith.

Now then...

00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:45,031
...let us all bow
our heads in prayer.

He's the same kind
of weapon I am...

311
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,961
...and he did all
that by himself...

312
00:18:58,044 --> 00:18:59,671
With my meister
immobilized like this,

313
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:01,381
I can't even fight...

314
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:04,342
All I can do is sit
here and hold her.

315
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,262
Damn it.

316
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:24,195
[Soul] You still can't
move at all, Maka?

317
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,656
Man, that's one stubborn spell
Arachne put on you...

318
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,908
Doesn't look like
it's going anywhere.

319
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:31,327
I feel so inept.

320
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,829
Uh-huh.

321
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:34,914
Hey... hold on a sec.

322
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:38,084
Is it really necessary
to put me in here?

323
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,754
[All]
What?

324
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:41,755
Come on. I know at

325
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,381
least one of you
can read my lips.

326
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,091
For now I guess
our best bet is to ask

327
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,385
Professor Stein if he
can fix her up somehow.

328
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:48,595
Yes, I agree...

If anyone knows
what to do, it'll be him...

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,516
Stein is a doctor, after all.

331
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,851
Yeah, that's true.

332
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:58,313
I'm sure Stein won't
do anything weird to me.

333
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,399
Hey...
Maka... a flower!

334
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,071
Thank you Crona.

335
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,990
[Maka thinks] I think I
understand how Sid felt now.

336
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,252
A red carpet here in the
middle of the mountains?

337
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,713
I've been awaiting
your arrival...

338
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,674
Lady Arachne.

339
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,844
[Arachne] Mosquito. The air
here has become quite dry

340
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,555
and stagnant in the last
eight hundred years...

341
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,724
It's making me very thirsty.

342
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:35,934
I have an excellent bottle

343
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,895
of champagne chilled
and waiting for you.

344
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,069
This car's so
cramped and stuffy.

345
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,412
[Giriko]
There. That's better.

346
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,709
Humph...!

347
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,211
You vulgar hoodlum
show some gratitude.

348
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:05,922
What...? You want a piece
of me, old man?

349
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,425
Never mind your
squabbling, boys...

350
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,051
I'm exhausted...

351
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,970
Hurry to the castle.

352
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,936
[Death] Not only has
the Kishin revived,

353
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,563
but it's madness has also

354
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:25,275
revived the heretic
witch Arachne.

355
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:29,404
Yet another dangerous
enemy that must be dealt with.

356
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,793
[Mosquito]
It's been such a long time...

357
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,545
Lady Arachne this is the

358
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,964
network you have
spent 800 years creating.

359
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,466
Congratulations.

360
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,471
[Voices]
Lady Arachne...!

361
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:57,682
Congratulations on your revival!

362
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,602
Lady Arachne...!

363
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:04,147
Congratulations on your revival!

364
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,616
[Arachne]
I will defeat you...

365
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,159
...Death.

367
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,503
[Maka] Justin, what kind of
organization is Arachnophobia?

368
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:54,758
[Justin humming to music]

369
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:57,010
Um, Justin...? Hold on...

370
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,887
Can't you read lips?

371
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:03,975
Hey, Justin!

372
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,352
Whatever.

373
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:07,270
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

374
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:08,563
The Sword God Rises...

375
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,523
Does it Have a
Sweet or Salty Taste?

376
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:11,399
[Justin]
"Breast?!"...

377
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,901
How dare you speak that way?!

378
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,695
[Maka] I don't think you can
read my lips very well.
