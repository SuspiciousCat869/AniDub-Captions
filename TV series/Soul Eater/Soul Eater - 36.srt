I recovered the Magic Tool...

167
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,544
I successfully completed
the assigned mission...

168
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:10,465
So why do I feel like I was
the one defeated back there?

169
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,883
How humiliating...!

170
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,301
Me, reduced to this...?!

171
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,096
Those brats will pay,
I swear it.

172
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,848
[Ox]
Maka!

173
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,558
[Kilik]
Black Star!

174
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:23,144
Where are you?

175
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:27,315
Looks like you're
all in one piece.

176
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,233
Hurry you guys...

177
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,402
The time is almost up.

178
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,444
This way.

179
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,321
I thought you
were still outside.

180
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,615
What are you doing here?

181
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:39,911
What's with the panting,
Black Star...?

182
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,246
That's not like you at all.

183
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,288
[Black Star]
Shaddup...

184
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,416
Just gimme a hand, will ya?

185
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,085
Sure...

186
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,713
That's why we came
in the first place.

187
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,345
What... what
the hell is that...?

188
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,388
Not good!

189
00:14:58,471 --> 00:14:59,806
We're goners for sure...!

190
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,057
We're all gonna die...

191
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,726
Goodbye, Kim!

192
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,060
[Maka] This is just
an image of what

193
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,854
happened eight
hundred years ago...

194
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,397
We'll be fine. We're just seeing

195
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,025
the blast that went
off back then.

196
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,824
I knew this wasn't good!

197
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,702
[Ox and Kilik]
We're gonna die!

198
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,288
Uh guys... It isn't real.

199
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,123
Oh, hey, I guess you're right...

200
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,833
How 'bout that.

201
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:36,092
[Kid thinks]
Eibon...

202
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,013
Let's get out of here.

203
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,787
We failed. I'm sorry...

204
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,872
The enemy got Brew.

205
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,297
[Marie sobs]

206
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,675
Um, Miss Marie...

207
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:17,967
All of you are in big trouble

208
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,095
once we get back
to the academy...

209
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,806
You should prepare yourselves!

210
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,474
[Black Star] Hey...
Why'm I the only one

211
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:26,559
you've got by the neck.

212
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:31,106
I'm so glad you're all okay!

213
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,275
[Sid]
Hey...! Over here!

214
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:36,945
Don't worry Sid, it's fine...

215
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,321
We're all right.

216
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,699
You had us all terrified...!

217
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,451
And what about Brew? Is it ours?

218
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:47,997
Oh, I see...

219
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:50,208
Stein, can you stand up...?

220
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,252
Here, let me help you.

221
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:54,170
[Stein]
Thank you.

222
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,382
Maka.

223
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,009
What's this? A mirror?

224
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:01,177
[Sid] Once we're off the island,
I want you to use it to give

225
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,972
Lord Death a full report
of what happened here...

226
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,223
Can you handle that?

227
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,725
Yes, sir.

228
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,894
[Sid]
Well... It's over...

229
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,980
Let's go home.

230
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:14,524
[Maka]
Forty-two, Forty-two,

231
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,818
Five-sixty-four...

232
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,907
Hello, Lord Death.
Are you there?

233
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:26,161
My Maka...! Are you okay...?!

234
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:29,456
I was so, so, so, so,
so worried about you!!!

235
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:30,623
Yeah, I'm fine...

236
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:31,875
Calm down...

237
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,044
Can you put Lord Death on.

238
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,170
[Death]
Hello, hello!

239
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,963
Wassup, wassup, wassup?

240
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,007
Good to see ya!

241
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,801
So... How'd the mission go?

242
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,720
You see, sir...

243
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,682
[Death]
Oh... well...

244
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,352
I'm sure you did all you could.

245
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:59,069
I have returned, Lady Arachne.

246
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,071
So I see, Mosquito...

247
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,947
And was the mission successful?

248
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,116
Have you brought
Brew to me as well...?

249
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,578
Come... I would
like to look at it.

250
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:11,748
Yes ma'am... Here it is.

251
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,833
[Arachne]
Is something wrong...?

252
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,752
Take it out of its case.

253
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:19,005
Well my lady...

254
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,840
I fear eight hundred
years was too

255
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:23,551
long for it to
be inside that field.

256
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,722
What are you saying, Mosquito?

257
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,853
The device has been degraded...

258
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:37,399
Brew is worthless,
it no longer functions.

259
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,946
Is that so...?

260
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,449
Fortunately, I always
prepared for the worst...

261
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,827
Look at me, Mosquito.

262
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,328
My lady, I'm sorry.

263
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:53,248
Our eight hundred years of
suffering were all for nothing!

264
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,458
[Arachne]
Functional or not,

265
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,877
I am now in possession of Brew.

266
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,588
That's enough to
frighten our enemies...

267
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:09,097
After all, the DWMA doesn't
know that Brew is broken.

268
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,140
Yes, indeed.

269
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:12,892
What a truly
delicious bluff, m'lady.

270
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,769
The information
that Arachnophobia

271
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,523
possesses the tool is a
weapon in its own right...

272
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:22,444
And I happen to excel at
spreading such information.

273
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,112
We have acquired Brew,

274
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,115
the most powerful tool
created by the Great Wizard...

275
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:30,994
We are armed with a
threat and our enemies' fear.

276
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:46,343
[Medusa] Well done...
Now where is it?

277
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,344
[Eruka]
Right here...

278
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,138
This is the real
version of Brew.

279
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,601
Arachne,
what a silly little fool...

280
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:57,479
She caused that explosion all
those centuries ago to keep

281
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,648
Brew's existence hidden
from the Reaper.

282
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,901
Your spies did
very well, Eruka...

283
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:05,904
Thanks to them, we knew it
had survived the blast.

284
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,364
Arachne didn't think to plant

285
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:10,533
any surveillance spiders
in the magnetic field...

286
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,952
That made it a simple enough
task for us to swipe the

287
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:15,497
real Brew and leave behind
the useless fake we had

288
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,624
created to use as a decoy.

289
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,460
And Arachne will have no idea
the Magic Tool in her

290
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,962
possession isn't
even the real thing.

291
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,965
[Eruka] The problem now
is the DWMA, right...?

292
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,551
How do we keep
them out of the way?

293
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:31,638
[Medusa] I still have Crona
spying on them for me...

294
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,056
Have you forgotten...?

295
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:36,351
You helped him plant
that bug, right?

296
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,812
No, of course I remember!

297
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,063
Crona and I planted that

298
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:42,399
snake inside Professor
Stein's partner.

299
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:47,237
You understand that that
little snake is more than

300
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,990
just a way of listening in on
their conversations, don't you?

301
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:52,492
Kinda.

302
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:55,328
That snake was implanted
with a magic designed

303
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:58,248
to speed up his madness.

304
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:01,376
It's not my best work,
but it should be enough.

305
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,796
Stein's mental state isn't the
most stable to begin with.

306
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,800
But it's a balancing act...

307
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:10,093
We don't want his madness to

308
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:13,221
reach its peak too
soon or too late.

309
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:19,144
[Medusa] The Reaper places
great faith in Stein...

310
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,646
He'll be sent to the
forefront of the battle.

311
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:24,816
While fighting,
Stein will naturally

312
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,318
have to resonate
with his partner.

313
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,407
And when he does...

314
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,577
The snake's magic
will hit him all at once.

315
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,995
[Eruka thinks]
She knew there was going to

316
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:40,206
be a struggle over Brew
before she placed that snake!

317
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,875
She's controlling
this huge fight

318
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,587
between the two sides
with one tiny reptile?!

319
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,633
[Medusa]
Brew. The Tempest...

320
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:52,052
Only someone who knows

321
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:55,638
how to create a truly
great storm deserves it.

322
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,062
This is just the
beginning for the academy...

323
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:04,356
...and Arachnophobia...

324
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,024
...and you...

325
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,609
...Kishin.

326
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,780
[Medusa laughs]
