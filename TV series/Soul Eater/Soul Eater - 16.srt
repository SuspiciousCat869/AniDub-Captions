We found a survivor...

He told us...

The black dragon came...

'the black dragon.'

When we climbed
aboard the ship,

16
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,750
we found hundreds of
disembodied human souls...

17
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,958
They were guarded by an
evil spirit who refused

18
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,083
to turn them over to us.

offer to the Kishin!

166
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,875
Now I have to
begin all over again...

167
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,375
Oh, great Kishin...

168
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,916
...grant me one more
chance to please you!

169
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,166
[Medusa] I have the results
of your blood tests.

170
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,500
Okay. What do they say, Doctor?

171
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,625
Your red and white cell
counts are normal...

172
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,916
I don't see any
hemoglobin issues, either...

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,958
It's good news...

174
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,083
You're a very
healthy young lady.

175
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,916
Huh...? Really, are you sure...?

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,875
It's just that, I'm certain...

177
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,333
...I coughed up... something.

178
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,083
[Maka] It looked
like black blood.

179
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,250
Why do you think that could be?

180
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,291
[Medusa] Well... over time,
blood tends to darken in color.

181
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,833
Maybe...
that's why the blood

182
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,541
you coughed up
looked black to you.

183
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:23,583
Yeah... it's still
kind of unsettling.

184
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,166
[Medusa thinks]
Unsettling indeed.

185
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,625
I was there too,
watching the whole thing...

186
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,208
I saw you cough
up that black blood.

187
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,875
Such powerful resonance
between weapon and meister

188
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,208
should cause the
transfer of black blood.

189
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,625
Um, Doctor Medusa...

190
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,250
Is something bothering you?

191
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,541
No, I was just deciding
what medicine to give you.

192
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,750
Take one of these
pills twice a day...

193
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,625
...one in the morning
and one at night.

194
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,750
[Medusa thinks]
These pills enhance

195
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,541
the effects of black blood...

196
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,708
Maybe they can help to fix

197
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,500
this new little glitch
in my experiment.

198
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,500
So, Maka...

199
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,291
How's Soul holding
up these days?

200
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,833
[Maka]
What do mean?

201
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,625
Is he still having that
strange dream with

202
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,083
the demon in it...?

203
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,625
He seemed to be
quite troubled by it.

204
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,583
What dream...? What demon?

205
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
I'm sorry...
I thought he would've

206
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,333
told you about it. He told me.

207
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,500
Oh yes, of course...

208
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,291
...that dream.
I think it's all gone now.

209
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,291
He's doing fine, really. A-OK!

210
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,166
What dream?
Why didn't he tell me...?

211
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,666
I'll kill Soul!

212
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,166
Is that all Doctor Medusa?

213
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,916
Okay, well thanks a lot!

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,666
Bye-bye for now. I'll see ya.

215
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,000
Such a stupid little girl.

216
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,875
He told her about it
and he didn't tell me...?

217
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,458
So basically, Soul feels he can
trust Doctor Medusa more

218
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,333
than he can trust
his own partner.

219
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,291
That's it...!

220
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,166
He's got some explaining to do.

221
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,833
[Medusa thinks] This doesn't
make any sense...

222
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,333
How has the black blood
inside Maka disappeared?

223
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,125
The design of my
experiment was flawless.

224
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:11,125
Maka... Maka Albarn...
where is your file?

225
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,291
It's not here...

226
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,333
Could somebody
have taken it?

227
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,375
[Stein] Is this what you're
looking for Doctor?

228
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,125
Oh! You startled me...!

229
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,708
I didn't see
you standing there...

230
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,041
You shouldn't sneak up 
on people like that.

231
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,875
The partners Soul Eater
and Maka Albarn...

232
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,291
Why are you so
interested in them?

233
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,541
[Medusa thinks]
What is this?

234
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,083
Well, it's just that those
two have been through

235
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,375
a lot lately, you know?

236
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,041
[Stein] Can you
explain what this is...?

237
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,375
I took it from Maka...

238
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,791
I must say,
I've never come across

239
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,250
this particular medicine before.

240
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,083
[Medusa] How much
does he know...?

241
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,708
Has the crazy professor
figured out my real identity,

242
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,666
or is he just guessing?

243
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,125
Should I kill him?

244
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,000
It's a type of herbal
remedy I created myself...

245
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,416
I designed it to improve

246
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,291
blood circulation and
help to regulate the pulse.

247
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
Ahh...

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,541
[Medusa thinks]
I'm not even lying to him...

249
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,291
Black blood works in
much the same way

250
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,666
that regular blood does...

251
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,750
The medicine will do
exactly what I said it would. 

252
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, you caught me.

253
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,916
I'm secretly obsessed
with herbal remedies...

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,416
I know it seems strange...

255
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
I mean it is
non-traditional medicine...

256
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,833
I just wanted to help
Maka and Soul that's all.

257
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,625
How sweet of you, Doctor...

258
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,166
That is quite
endearing, really...

259
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,791
But tell me something...

260
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,750
...are you helping
because you're a doctor...

261
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,958
Or is it because
you're a witch.

262
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,291
You're horrible...

263
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,708
Commenting on my
appearance like that!

264
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,333
I don't have to listen
to this from you...!

265
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,833
It's sexual harassment!

266
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,833
[Stein laughs]

267
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,166
Promise me something.

268
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,250
If you're gonna sue,
go after Spirit first, okay?

269
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,166
[Medusa] If you
broke that chair,

270
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,208
I hope you're
going to pay for it.

271
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,333
[Stein] For a second there,
I think she wanted to kill me.

272
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,375
Damn... I'm shaking.

273
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,000
This is fear...?
That's good then...

274
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,000
I'd forgotten what it felt like.

275
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,916
I guess the ball's
in my court now.

276
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,500
Well, Stein?

277
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,166
Yes, I'm certain of it...

278
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,791
What about the location
of Medusa's home?

279
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,416
Already looked into it...

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,291
I was a very
meticulous man, you know.

281
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,500
That hasn't changed.

282
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,833
We can handle this case,
Professor... All right?

283
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,250
Sid... Naigus...
Just be careful...

284
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,375
We're dealing with a witch.

285
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,166
It's not going to be easy.

286
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,250
Trust me, Stein.

287
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,791
We are aware of that...

288
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,833
We've seen plenty of people
lose their lives to witches

289
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,000
during our time.

290
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,708
We'll take all the
necessary precautions.

291
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,916
[Naigus]
Let's go, Sid.

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,375
Yeah.

293
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,250
[Sid] We just need to find
physical evidence

294
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,541
that she's a witch...

295
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,208
Then Lord Death can
issue a warrant for her.

296
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,291
[Sid]
We've seen the tip of

297
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,041
the treacherous
serpent's tail...

298
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,500
And now...

299
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,250
Now we have to grab it.

300
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,166
[Medusa thinks]
Eruka...

301
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,250
Eruka!

302
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm speaking to you through

303
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,541
the snakes I implanted
in your body.

304
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,708
Look in the attaché case...

305
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,875
There you'll find
the item you need...

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Yes... That one
there, that's it...

307
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,458
Now, go quickly.

308
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,875
[Medusa thinks]
I assume I don't have to

309
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,625
explain what you
need to do next.

310
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,541
I'm glad we're back.

311
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,750
That sure was
a crazy trip, huh...?

312
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,541
I'm pooped.

313
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,000
[Kid]
Liz, Patty...

314
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,625
...you two go back
home to Gallows Manor.

315
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,291
[Liz]
Where are you going, Kid?

316
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,291
[Kid] I have to ask
my father something.

317
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,625
[Naigus]
Down there?

318
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,916
[Sid]
Yeah.

319
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,958
Do you think you should...

320
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,833
[Naigus]
I'm on it.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
[Sid]
Unlocked?

322
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,208
[Naigus]
Careful... it could be a trap.

323
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,375
I know that.

324
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,791
When I was alive...

325
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,875
I was a rather cautious man,
thank you very much.

326
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:21,041
[Sid] Whoa...this is supposed to
be the home of a school nurse?

327
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,708
Look here.

328
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,500
[Naigus] A magic circle
covered in witch's writing.

329
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,375
It's certain now.

330
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,708
A diary?

331
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,458
Yeah, that's what
it looks like to me.

332
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,750
But I was not the type of
man who went sneaking

333
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,416
around reading women's diaries. 

334
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,333
[Naigus]
This is no time for chivalry...

335
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,333
I think you can make an
exception for a witch's diary.

336
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,541
[Sid]
Yeah, I guess I can.

337
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,333
Huh?!

338
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,625
[Naigus]
What?

339
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,916
[Sid]
It's all in here...

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,333
She knows everything
about the academy!

341
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,375
I think this could be

342
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,875
showing us what
Medusa is after...

343
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,541
...and why she's been
researching black blood.

344
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,833
If she springs this plan
during tomorrow's festivities

345
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,375
we're in trouble...

346
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,666
We have to tell the professor
and Lord Death immediately!

347
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,125
Sid!

348
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,958
[Sid] What the...
what are they?

349
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,291
Sid]
No!!

350
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,625
There... Well, I hope you
enjoyed my Tadpole Bombs.

351
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,833
Ribbit... I do like
destroying things...

352
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,666
It's so lovely to
have been born a witch.

353
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,708
Now to I need to hurry up
and get this to Medusa.

354
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,583
[Death]
Well, well, heya!

355
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,500
Long time no see, Kiddo...

356
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,708
Good to have you back!

357
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,625
I hear you ran
into the Demon Sword.

358
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,291
Father... I have
something to ask you.

359
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,958
Oh...?

360
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,208
What's eating you, Kid.

361
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,416
I may be a reaper,

362
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,958
but I'm still young,
and I understand that.

363
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,791
Still, there is too
much I don't know.

364
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,875
Someone mentioned

365
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,541
"the kishin who
is right next to us"...

366
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,125
What does that mean, Father.

367
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,500
[Death] People and gods
alike possess weaknesses.

368
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,958
In order to bury those failings,
they seek strength and power.

369
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,666
Fear and desire are
two sides of the same coin.

370
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,333
No, Father...

371
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,291
You're avoiding my question.

372
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,458
That's not what I'm asking you.

373
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:38,250
"The Kishin who's
right next to us..."

374
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,375
I want you to explain
that phrase to me...

375
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,750
Does it have something to do

376
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,375
with why you can't
leave the academy?

377
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,208
I need to know, Father.

378
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,250
Tell me what it means.

379
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:56,000
♪ closing song ♪

380

[Maka]
Hey, guess what...?

381
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,833
Excalibur's making another
appearance next time.

382
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,000
[Patty]
Excalibur!

383
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,833
[Maka] What does
Excalibur remind you of?

384
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,375
Doesn't he look familiar? 

385
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,541
[Patty]
Excalibur!

386
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,791
[Maka]
A rhino, maybe?

387
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,708
Or some kinda hippo?

388
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:35,541
[Patty]
Excalibur!

389
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,166
[Maka]
I know!

390
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,250
A Tasmanian devil!

391
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,875
[Patty]
No way.

392
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,833
[Patty] On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

Legend of the Holy Sword II...

Wanna Go Drinking,
Gambling, and Playing?

395
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,500
[Maka] Okay, let's all
say it together...

396
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:50,875
[Patty]
You're lame!
