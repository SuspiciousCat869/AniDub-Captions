00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,458
Come on! Let's hurry
up and get going!

163
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,708
Wait... Black Star!

164
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,958
[Death] There's also
something the two

165
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,833
of you should know
about the witch Angela...

166
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,666
Oh, hey...! They never listen.

167
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,000
[Black Star]
Hya-hoo!

168
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,375
[Tsubaki] Wait
for me, Black Star!

169
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,791
[Black Star]
What is it?

170
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,416
[Tsubaki] We can't even succeed
on a regular mission...

171
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,750
We'll never be able
to win against a witch.

172
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,791
Why not?

173
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,291
[Tsubaki] Just
trust me on this...

174
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,833
Anyway we can't just rush
into this like we normally do.

175
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,541
We need to come up with a plan.

176
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,333
[Maka] Jeez... Tsubaki could
probably partner up with anyone

177
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,416
she wanted to... So why him?

178
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,416
Black Star's kind of
an idiot, but he's got guts...

179
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,333
He's not as much
of a jerk as he seems.

180
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,583
I'm sure Tsubaki
knows that by now.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,208
Yeah...

182
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,375
That may be why they work.

183
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,458
[Soul]
Well, anyway...

184
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,125
We should get going too...

185
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,833
We still have 99 Kishin souls

186
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,791
to collect and
a witch to defeat...

187
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,500
That's a long way to go.

188
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,958
[Maka]
Yeah.

189
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,416
[Henchman 3] There's a witch
living inside this castle, Boss.

190
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,041
[Alcapone] And after
we capture her soul,

191
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,375
my family will
be the strongest...

192
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,833
Ya know?

193
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,708
Don Alcapone.

194
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,166
So Alcapone...

195
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,416
What could possibly bring

196
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,083
a dirty mob boss like
yourself to this castle?

197
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:09,000
And if I don't like
your answer... you die.

198
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,291
Well what do ya
know a tough guy...

199
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,958
Kill him.

200
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,250
[Tsubaki's voice in Black Star's
head] We can't even succeed

201
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,833
on a regular mission...

202
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,125
We'll never be able
to win against a witch.

203
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,250
Stupid Tsubaki.

204
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,458
How could she say that...?

205
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,041
I don't care if it is
a witch we're after.

206
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,375
It's a walk in the park.

207
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,041
Taking someone's soul
is almost too easy for me.

208
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,166
I'll sneak up on Tsubaki

209
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,708
and show her how
big of an assassin I am.

210
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,750
[Black Star] Assassin's
Rule Number One...

211
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,750
Silence. Dissolve
in the darkness

212
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,125
and erase your breath...

213
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,875
Wait for an opening
to attack your target.

214
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,875
[Black Star cries out]

215
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,583
[Black Star cries out]

216
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,666
Silence means approaching...

217
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,125
...quietly.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,291
[Tsubaki] If you're
trying to be an assassin,

219
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,875
you have to learn
how to shut up.

220
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,208
Oh, did I do that?

221
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,500
[Black Star]
Dying now...

222
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,000
My breath will
be erased... Okay?

223
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,458
Okay.

224
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,416
[Black Star]
Hya-hoo!

225
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,333
Where are you, witch?

226
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,291
It's time to die!

227
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,416
Hold on a second,
Black Star.

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,041
Did you come up with a plan
for defeating Witch Angela?

229
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,291
Of course I did...!

230
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,458
And it begins with me
making a big entrance!

231
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,833
Yeah, I get it.

232
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,291
Obviously you did not
come up with a plan for us.

233
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,583
[Black Star]
Don't worry, Tsubaki.

234
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,083
Okay...?I'm totally gonna
turn you into a Death scythe,

235
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,416
and a strong one...!

236
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,458
Trust me on that.

237
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,666
I know you will.

238
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,083
Wonder what happened here.

239
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,083
This day's turning
out to be a bit annoying.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,458
These eggs--
there must be a hundred

241
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,583
Kishin souls
floating around here...

242
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,250
Are you responsible
for all of this?

243
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
[Mifune] Did you
come here hoping to

244
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,250
collect the Witch
Angela's soul?

245
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,375
Are you incredibly strong...?

246
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,750
I hope you are...

247
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,666
Because I'm going to
beat you in a bigger way

248
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,083
than you could imagine!

249
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,291
Better get ready,
'cuz we're gonna duel.

250
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,833
[wind howls]

251
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,750
My name is Mifune...

252
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,250
I am the guardian
of the witch Angela.

253
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,000
My name is Black Star...

254
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,583
I'll surpass the
power of the gods!

255
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,958
I prefer to kill
only when necessary...

256
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,875
So leave this place and
stay away from Angela.

257
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,041
Tsubaki.

258
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,500
Right.

259
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,875
So then...
you're a weapon meister.

260
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,250
[Black Star] Compared to a
man as big as me,

261
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,750
you realize how small
you are, don't you...?

262
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
I understand how you feel.

263
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,208
Even I can be frightened
by my own greatness.

264
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,541
So I find it difficult to
stand in front of mirrors.

265
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,833
Infinite Sword Attack...

266
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,041
This is--

267
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,750
[Tsubaki] You need to
be careful, Black Star.

268
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,500
[Mifune] If you still
refuse to retreat, then...

269
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,958
Die.

270
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,916
If you really want to kill me,
you're going to need

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,625
a lot more than a
few fancy flying swords!

272
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,291
I'll take that.

273
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,083
Your weapon's strength
has saved you...

274
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,291
If this were a regular chain,
it would've broken already.

275
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,458
This is your last warning.

276
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,458
Keep your distance from here...

277
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,708
If I have to kill a kid,
I'll get nightmares.

278
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,791
You bastard.

279
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,416
You're calling me
a kid, are you...?

280
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,250
You're wrong...

281
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,750
The kids I know are small...

282
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,541
No stupid kid could
be as big a guy as I am.

283
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,375
Tsubaki-- Transform!
Shuriken Mode!

284
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you know what would

285
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,333
make you a much
smaller man, Mifune?

286
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,041
If I cut you into
four little pieces!

287
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:46,833
Tsubaki...!

288
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,041
Smoke Bomb mode, go!

289
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,500
Right!

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,583
[Black Star]
Hya-hoo!

291
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,708
I got you now!

292
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,625
Idiot! Why can't you
learn to be quiet!

293
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,916
You blew it, Black Star!

294
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,333
Oh no! He got hit!

295
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,208
Such a fool.

296
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,375
No!

297
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,833
He's not--

298
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,541
[Black Star] Mifune...
you're an arrogant bastard.

299
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,250
You shouldn't use the
back of the blade against

300
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,583
an opponent who's so
much bigger than you are!

301
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,375
You know, kid...

302
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,875
I'm beginning to feel real
sorry for that weapon of yours.

303
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,583
The only reason that
you've survived this

304
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,500
fight for so long is her
strength and intelligence...

305
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,541
But no matter how good
a weapon may be,

306
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,875
it's wasted if an unskilled
master is wielding it.

307
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,958
You're just a
useless little kid...

308
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,666
Can't you see that?

309
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,541
You're wrong about him!

310
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,666
Sure, Black Star
is a little bit...

311
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,458
...a little bit careless
sometimes...

312
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,166
But if he really tried,
I know he could do it!

313
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,916
Mifune.

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,333
It's your move...

315
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,375
What now?

316
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,916
I don't have an agenda...

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,916
I'm only here to protect Angela.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,500
[Black Star] That's not
really it, though, is it?

319
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,833
I know what you're
trying to do, Mifune...

320
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,541
I understand it real well.

321
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,250
You wanna beat me
to make me look small...

322
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,583
So that you'll appear
greater by comparison.

323
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,291
But I won't let you
get away with that!

324
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,500
You can look high or low,

325
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,750
but you won't find a
bigger guy than me...!

326
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,166
I'm gonna win this battle...

327
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,666
Ya got me?

328
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,000
[Mifune thinks]
That's interesting...

329
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,000
His eye color changed.

330
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,666
[Black Star] Tsubaki...
switch to Ninja Blade mode.

331
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,125
Alright.

332
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,666
[Black Star] Mifune,
I hope you're ready...

333
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,958
Now we fight for real.

334
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,833
I won't be using the back
of the blade this time.

335
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,083
[Black Star thinks] Assassin's
Rule Number One...

336
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,333
Silence.

337
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,916
Dissolve in the darkness
and erase your breath.

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,458
Wait for an opening
to attack your target.

339
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,208
Assassin's rule number two...

340
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,041
Transpositional thinking...

341
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,291
Analyze the target in order to

342
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,875
predict his thoughts
and movements.

343
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,291
[Mifune thinks]
What's happening...?

344
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,458
Is this the same brat
from a minute ago?

345
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,083
[Black Star thinks] Assassin's
rule number three...

346
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,541
[Mifune thinks]
Impossible...

347
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,958
I should be able to hear
his breath from here.

348
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,916
No, wait...

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,833
I can hear some
faint breathing.

350
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,583
But it can't be his...
this kid can't control anything.

351
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,750
[Black Star thinks]
Speed...

352
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,750
Before the target
notices your presence...

353
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,583
Wait! I know who you are!

354
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,458
[Black Star thinks]
Take the target out!

355
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,375
We call this one
the Shadow Star.

356
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,833
What?!

357
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,791
[Black Star] Finishing
Strike...! Black Star Big Wave!

358
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,083
I am the star.

359
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,750
You lose.

360
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,541
You didn't even see
me coming, did you...?

361
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,166
That's the third rule of
being a great assassin.

362
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,291
So foolish.

363
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,375
Don't blame yourself.

364
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,291
You never had a
shot at beating me...

365
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,750
Like I said, you'd need more
than some fancy flying swords. 

366
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,875
Tsubaki.

367
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,333
Right.

368
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,500
Where's the witch?

369
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,500
[Angela]
Stop it! No!

370
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,333
Bad man!

371
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,083
Don't hurt Mifune!

372
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,666
No, Angela.

373
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,666
He's my guardian!

374
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,916
I'm a witch, but I'm still

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,833
just a little kid so
Mifune is protecting me!

376
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,125
So mister, please
don't hurt my Mifune!

377
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,250
This girl is the witch Angela?

378
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,666
[Tsubaki]
Black Star...

379
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,000
We have the scattered souls
of the Alcapone gang

380
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,666
and a witch without
magical power right

381
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,208
in front of us...

382
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,416
I don't know that we'll ever
have a chance like this again.

383
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,916
Ahhh.... Okay but...

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
Jerk jerk jerk jerk jerk!

385
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,208
Jerk!

386
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,333
--Mifune!
--I'll kill you, ya little brat!

387
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,125
You're free to go ahead
and take my life...

388
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:25,375
But... if killing Angela is
what you want, Assassin...

389
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,625
I swear on my sword
I will defend her.

390
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,083
What should we do?

391
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,000
A guardian who baby-sits
a little witch all day...?

392
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,000
Please, you aren't
even worth the effort.

393
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,375
Let's go, Tsubaki.

394
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,166
Right!

395
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,500
[Black Star] I mean, really...
I can't kill a kid...

396
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,791
It would give me nightmares.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,708
[Death]
Are you sure about this?

398
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,458
[Black Star] Yeah, I mean, it's
not like I killed 'em myself...

399
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,750
[Death] It's not setting the
best example to say this...

400
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,291
But you should take
while the taking's good!

401
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,708
Nah, a big guy like me

402
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,791
doesn't need people to do
his dirty work for him...

403
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,833
Isn't that right, Tsubaki?

404
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,750
[Death] Hmm? Hmm...

405
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,875
[Black Star thinks]
Assassin's rule number one.

406
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,916
Silence.
Dissolve in the darkness

407
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,833
and erase your breath.

408
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,875
Wait for an opening
to attack your target.

409
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,125
[Black Star cries out]

410
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,166
I told you--

411
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,375
silence means
approaching quietly.

412
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,375
Our future doesn't
look very promising.

413
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,791
[Narrator]
Death the Kid.

414
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,708
Son of Lord Death,
the Grim Reaper.

415
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,166
A perfect boy...

416
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,708
...with nearly perfect skill
and talent to match.

417

[Kid]
Lupin... It's all over.

419
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,875
Master thief, Lupin...!

420
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,583
Your soul has become
a Kishin Egg...

421
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,083
It is pure evil.

422
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,708
And now we have
come to claim it.

423
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,416
[Narrator] But the Kid is
obsessed with perfection.

424
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,375
Just look, Patty...!

425
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,416
Your stance is off again!

426
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,291
The two of you aren't in a line!

427
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,625
Oooh...! I'm sorry Kid!

428
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,083
[Narrator] And this obsession is
his one great weakness.

429
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,791
Prologue 3... Death the Kid...

430

[Black Star]
That was big...!

434
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,250
And I mean really big!
Don't you think?

435
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,875
[Maka] I don't know
about that Black Star...

436
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,458
You didn't recover any souls.

437
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,458
[Black Star] Clearly, you're
just jealous of my bigness.

00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,958
[Maka] That's enough
about you right now.

In the next episode,

I hear Lord Death's
son is the star.

[Black Star]
What?...!

442
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,458
You're telling me
Lord Death has a son?

443
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,625
[Maka] And does that
mean Lord Death is married?

444
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,250
When did that happen?

445
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,208

Death the Kid's
Magnificent Mission?
