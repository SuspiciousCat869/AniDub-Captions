How should I put this...

To describe it simply...

80
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,416
Tsubaki is engaged in a
sort of soul tug-of-war with

81
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
the Enchanted Sword Masamune.

82
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,125
[Stein] As her brother makes
his move to possess her soul,

83
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,000
Tsubaki is countering by
trying to absorb his...

84
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,250
The struggle will continue

85
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,250
until one soul defeats
the other and wins.

86
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,875
Tsubaki's using his own
technique against him...

87
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,583
Nice... but do you think she
has any chance of winning?

88
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,541
[Stein] It will
be difficult for her.

89
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,666
It's the sword's soul,

90
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,416
so he's got home
court advantage...

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,291
and Soul Possession is one
of his trademark techniques...

92
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,833
Yeah... Altogether, the chance
that Tsubaki will win is low.

93
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,916
Brother and sister locked
in a fight to the death!

There, there.

[Stein] A person who chooses
the path of the Kishin

98

99
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,541
The original Kishin sought

100
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,708
power in order to
escape the fear of death.

101
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,041
Why has Tsubaki's brother
chosen this path to power...?

102
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,041
What does he seek to
gain by becoming a Kishin?

103
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,666
[Masamune] You have
so many other options.

104

You could use your smoke
bomb or shuriken modes.

105
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,958
But you stick with
your plain old kasarigama.

106
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,000
Why are you holding back?

107
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,958
Pity...? Do you pity me?

108
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,291
[Stein]
Tsubaki and Masamune both

109
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,208
come from the
Nakatsukasa family...

110
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,750
That clan possesses
special weapon

111
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,916
abilities that are handed
down through the generations.

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,125
The previous generation's
abilities should have been

113
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,333
passed down to Masamune,
as he was the eldest son...

114
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,708
But instead...

115
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,666
You inherited everything
that should have gone

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,416
to me by birth right...

117
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,541
I inherited only one thing...

118
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,583
This sword.

119
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,916
For some reason,
the power was given to Tsubaki.

120
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,083
[Masamune] As a child
I was treated more

121

delicately than other boys.

122
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,041

00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,375
but I never realized it was
because I was inferior...

125

In the end,

126
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,791
the one who showed me
that sad truth... was you.

127
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,208
[Masamune]
The pity in your eyes.

128
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,208
That's how you looked
at me when we were children,

129
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,083
when you hid your own
emotions because you

130
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,083
thought you were the strong one.

131
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,375
I'll never forgive you for that.

163
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,166
You're the first person
to appreciate my talent...

164
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,000
Good for you...

165
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,208
You'll go far...

166
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,708
Now, what's your name?

167
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,833
Oh!

168
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,333
Tsubaki... I'm a weapon.

169
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,625
I'm the world's greatest
assassin, Black Star.

170
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,500
I'm a meister.

171
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,666
[Black Star] That was
the first time we met...

172
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,875
You watched my performance

173
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,791
all the way through
to the end that day.

174
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:12,041
Now it's my turn to see
you all the way through. 

175
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,208
[Brat]
Who's this woman?

176
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,375
She's been sitting
there for a long time.

177
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,625
You're with him aren't you...?

178
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,416
Well you can get
out of our village too!

179
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,791
[Black Star]
Listen, you little brat...

180
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,833
Don't even think
about interrupting Tsubaki

181
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,125
again or I'll kill you?

182
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,166
You got me?

183
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,083
Just sit there and
keep your mouth shut.

184
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,916
Oh yeah well
screw you Star clan!

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,625
[Masamune] Do you have any
last words before I kill you?

186
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,250
You truly are a pathetic little
camellia blossom, aren't you?

187
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,125
Nothing to say.

188
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,291
Hey Tsubaki, what do you
feel like playing today?

189
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,125
[Tsubaki]
Whatever you want to.

190
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,208
Come on, Tsubaki.

191
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,750
You always want
to play my game,

192
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,041
what do you want to play?

193
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,416
Okay... I want to play ball.

194
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,000
And now Tsubaki, your soul...

195
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,166
...belongs to me.

196
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,208
[stabbing sound]

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,208
[Maka] What's Tsubaki thinking,
taking him on all alone?

198
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,791
[Stein] Tsubaki is a powerful,
adaptable weapon...

199
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,250
She's very good
at what she does...

200
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,166
But this time,
her opponent is too strong.

201
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,041
I should've been the one
to face the Enchanted Sword.

202
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,083
But she's not really alone.

203
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,958
[Soul] Black Star's sitting
right next to her...

204
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,583
And he won't budge.

205
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,500
Tsubaki wouldn't be
able to fight if he wasn't

206
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,833
there with her, would she?

207
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,000
[Death]
Right.

208
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,083
What's important now
is what's in here...

209
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,916
We all know Tsubaki's an
incredibly versatile weapon...

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,375
She has many modes of attack
to defeat an opponent...

211
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,708
But that's not where
her true strength lies.

212
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,291
She carries that in her soul.

213
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,833
[Young Masamune]
Watch closely this time, okay?

214
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,083
[Young Tsubaki]
'Kay.

215
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,583
[Young Masamune]
See.

216
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,083
Did you really want
to play ball, Tsubaki?

217
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,083
Yes!

218
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,416
[Tsubaki]
But I didn't...

219
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,291
What I really wanted
to do was play house.

220
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,500
I wonder how long we
could have played together if

221
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,416
I'd been able to tell him that.

222
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,416
I am Tsubaki,
a flower without fragrance...

223
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,875
...and when I fall...

224
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,666
...it will be silent and tragic.

225
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,208
[Masamune] What are you feeling
right now, little sister?

226
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,458
Do you still look down on me...?

227
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,541
It must be nice to have

228
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,041
such a sense of
superiority over others.

229
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,416
You just stand there,
quiet and smug,

230
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,083
taking care of everyone else
because you're the strong one.

231
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,833
How can you deny it...?

232
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,375
That's who you've always been.

233
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,500
[Black Star] Please
tell me that's not

234
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,416
what you're actually thinking.

235
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,833
You know better
than that Tsubaki.

236
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,875
Don't even listen to this guy.

237
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,125
You're wrong.

238
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,000
You're wrong!

239
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:55,541
You're wrong! You're wrong!

240
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,125
You're wrong!

241
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,625
You're wrong!

242
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,583
I won't take care
of you anymore...!

243
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,416
That's over...

244
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,916
I'm going to stop you!

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
[Tsubaki]
Please...

246
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,125
Feel in your soul
how serious I am!

247
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm begging you.

248
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,416
You don't stand a chance...

249
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,958
No matter how brave
you pretend to be,

250
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,750
you're still just
a pathetic flower

251
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,333
with no voice or fragrance!

252
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,541
[Tsubaki]
You're wrong...

253
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,541
I won't let you call
me a pathetic flower...

254
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,208
I have a friend who's helped
me realize something.

255
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,458
He's helped me see...

256
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,708
...that a camellia...
does have a fragrance!

257
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,208
Tsubaki!

258
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,125
She's going inside
the Enchanted Sword...?

259
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,916
No, that can't be right.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,041
Did he beat Tsubaki...?

261
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,041
Does that mean it's over?

262
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,500
[Maka]
Tsubaki!

263
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,333
I won't watch this...!

264
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,291
It can't be real!

265
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,041
[Black Star] Old dude...!
Let me have that stick!

266
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,416
[Old Man grimaces]

267
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,875
[Black Star]
Hey, Tsubaki!

268
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,416
Come outta there already...!

269
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,250
You haven't lost
to him, have you...?

270
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,708
You can put on a
better show than that!

271
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,125
Come back out on stage!

272
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,416
Encore...! Encore!

273
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,833
Tsubaki, encore...!

274
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,708
Give us an encore!

275
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,291
[Masamune] At last...
you've finally shown me... 

276
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,875
What your feelings really are.

277
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,208
[wind blows]

278
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,750
[Masamune] I thought
the camellia blossom

279
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,458
was a boring flower...

280
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,166
...one without any fragrance.

281
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,541
But I was wrong, wasn't I...?

282
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,416
As soon as I touched
your soul, I realized that.

283
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,041
Masamune...

284
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,833
It's a nice fragrance.

285
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,875
[Tsubaki quietly weeps]

286
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,708
[Tsubaki]
Brother.

287
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,708
Encore! Encore!

288
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,041
Encore! Encore!

289
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,500
Encore!

290
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,208
Encore... Come on... encore...!

291
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,666
Encore... damn it!

292
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,916
Give us an encore...!

293
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,083
We want an encore!

294
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,125
[explosion]

295
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,166
See... I came back.

296
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,083
Tsubaki?

297
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,125
I just had to pay
a visit to my brother.

298
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
You did, huh...? Welcome back...

299
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,750
Are you all right?

300
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,208
I'm fine.

301
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,583
Are you sure
you're really okay.

302
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,041
Yes. I promise; I'm okay.

303
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,750
All right then... C'mere.

304
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,791
Come over here...

305
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,250
Black Star's giving
you a big hug.

306
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,208
[Black Star forces a chuckle]

307
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,416
I'm sorry!

308
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,708
[Tsubaki] Look at you,
Black Star!

309
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,500
You're all covered in blood...!

310
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,541
Are you all right?

311
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,166
Never mind about me,
Tsubaki. I'm fine.

312
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,625
[Whack]

313
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,416
That's it, ya little brat!

314
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,458
[Older woman]
Sonny!

315
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,166
Ryoku!

316
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,541
[Black Star]
The kid's still alive then...?

317
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,416
That's good news.

318
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,541
[Villager A] The Star
clan are all monsters.

319
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,916
[Old Man]
Beating a little kid?!

320
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,125
[Villager B]
Get outta here! Now!

321
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,000
[Black Star] You ever notice
how little dogs always feel

322
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,291
the need to bark loud...?

323
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,166
Why don't you mutts shut up?

324
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,750
You're scared of an enemy
that doesn't exist anymore...

325
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,625
How lame are you?

326
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,250
[Black Star] What's the point in
worrying about the past?

327
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,666
A real star always
keeps moving forward.

328
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,958
[Villager A]
Don't give us that!

329
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,458
[Villager B]
Go away!

330
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,250
[Old Man]
And don't come back!

331
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,750
[crowd hurls insults]

332
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,000
Uh oh.

333
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,750
Who'd wanna come
back here anyway?

334
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,541
I'm sorry!

335
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,250
Once you get to know him,

336
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,416
he's not bad. Really!

337
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,708
Even if he wasn't a
member of the Star clan,

338
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,041
I still wouldn't like that guy.

339
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,250
[Black Star]
So, Tsubaki...

340
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,833
Now that we're done
with the Enchanted Sword,

341
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,333
and you've taken care of
some baggage from your past...

342
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,375
...you're still gonna
be my weapon, right?

343
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,541
Of course!

344
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,000
All right!

345
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,041
[All]
Hey guys! Welcome back!

346
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,000
Thanks. What'd we miss?

347
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,291
I'm sorry we made
you all worry!

348
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,333
[Death]
Hey hey...!

349
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,250
Good work, you two.

350
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,083
Yeah, you guys were
amazing out there.

351
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,583
And you finally
bagged a soul, huh?

352
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,208
[Kid] The problem child
finally redeems himself.

353
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,875
[Soul] It sure took you
long enough, though.

354
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,500
[Black Star] I've always been
a little bit ahead of my time.

355
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,416
[Maka]
You did it, Tsubaki!

356
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,375
[Liz] That little
baby cried, you know.

357
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,666
[Patty] Nu-uh...!
That was you, sis!

358
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,000
You know, Lord Death...

359
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,833
I think I may have
underestimated what those

360
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,083
kids were capable of.

361
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,250
They're not so bad.

362
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,083
[Death] They are
still young, after all...

363
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,708
They've got plenty of
growing up left to do.

364
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,291
[Black Star]
Attention!

365
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,416
I hope you're all ready.

366
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,833
Because you're about to see
something incredibly awesome.

367
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,583
Oh, this should be good.

368
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,208
'Kay, listen to this...

369
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,416
Thanks to that soul we bagged,
Tsubaki's got a brand new mode!

370
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,083
[All]
Oohh!

371
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,791
Let's show 'em, Tsubaki!

372
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,250
[Tsubaki]
Right!

373
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,083
Enchanted Sword Mode...
Let's go!

374
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,041
[Tsubaki]
Black Star!

375
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,458
My soul wavelength
just got taken away.

376
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,333
I'm gonna miss it.

377
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,541
I don't think that's what
Black Star had planned...

378
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,875
He might not be
ready for that yet...

379
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,416
This is interesting, though...

380
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,625
Looks like Tsubaki
inherited her brother's power.

381
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,125
This settles it.

382
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,625
I was born way too soon...

383
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,833
The times are never able
to keep up with me.

384
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,208
Then we'll wait
for them together...

385
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,250
Right, Black Star?

had a happy ending!

388

Thanks Maka...!

You can have it too, you know?

390

Have what, Tsubaki?

391

[Tsubaki]
Happiness, of course!

In other words, this right here.

393

[Maka]
A jar...?

anyone can find true happiness.

in a second one free...!

limited time offer while
