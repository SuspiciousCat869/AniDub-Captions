1
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,951
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,162
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:49,956
...and a sound body.

4
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:05,430
Lady Arachne!
I can't feel her soul...

5
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:08,350
My mistress is
lost to me forever.

6
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,415
♪ opening song ♪

7
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:04,716
Maka...

8
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,509
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

9
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,511
I'm ready for anything.

10
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,597
Lord Death can't
fight anymore...

11
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,766
It's up to us now.

12
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:23,651
Asura Wakes...
To the End of the World?

13
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:30,283
Is that him?

14
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,868
Yes, it's the Kishin...

15
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:34,079
You can almost feel
the evil coming from him.

16
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:35,413
Let's get him, Tsubaki!

17
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:36,915
Right.

18
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,918
Hold on a sec, Black Star...!
I'm coming.

19
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,419
No Mifune...

20
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:44,172
You need to take that midget
and get outta here quickly.

21
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,257
Hey, you dummy!
Take that back!

22
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,593
Angie's not a midget!

23
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:51,137
Are you sure
you want to do this?

24
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,972
Yeah, I am...!

25
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:56,351
I'm the man who's gonna
surpass god, remember?

26
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,061
Black Star!

27
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,073
Not good... not at all.

28
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,826
What is that thing?!

29
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,077
A barrier.

30
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,578
A barrier?

31
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:17,205
The Kishin was badly
injured during

32
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,540
his fight with Lord Death...

33
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:21,626
He's going into
a deep sleep to heal.

34
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:25,463
No, he can't...!
If he does, then that means...

35
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,383
The madness wavelength
will continue to expand...

36
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,427
His insanity will
take over the world

37
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,637
without him lifting a finger.

38
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,015
No it won't...

39
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:37,600
I can't sit here
and let that happen...

40
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:39,436
Liz...! Patty!

41
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,937
Yeah!

42
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,071
I will take my father's place...
He can't fight now, but I can.

43
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:53,908
As a Grim Reaper...
I will protect this world.

44
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,874
Kid, where are you going...?!
You can't just run off...!

45
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,834
Come back here!

46
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,502
You're going to charge
in there without a meister...?

47
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,463
What good will that do?

48
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,428
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

49
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,971
Move it!
Move it!

50
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:35,909
Yo, Maka.

51
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,452
Getting' here a
little late, aren't ya?

52
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:38,453
Sorry...

53
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,039
I had some things
to take care of.

54
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,500
So, we all began this
battle in different places...

55
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,586
...and yet here we are,
back together at the end of it.

56
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,462
Yep...

57
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:48,797
I'm not complaining.

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,299
Yeah...
neither am I.

59
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,634
All right...

60
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:54,886
...keep a tight rein on
your souls at all times...

61
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,055
Do not let down your guard...

62
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,974
If you do...
the madness will consume you...

63
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,435
We can't afford
to let that happen.

64
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,187
We know.

65
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,356
He got me last time.

66
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,698
But this time I'm
gonna make him pay!

67
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,449
To preserve this world...

68
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,202
...and to avenge my father...

69
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,371
I will beat you!

70
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,338
If we manage to make
it out of this alive,

71
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,091
something tells me ghosts won't
scare me so much anymore.

72
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,426
Wow...!

73
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,344
That would make you
as strong as a Grim Reaper!

74
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,762
Now, now, Patty...

75
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,597
Let's not get too
carried away, okay?

76
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,851
I not gonna be volunteering
for that job anytime soon.

77
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,310
Can I?

78
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:45,812
Black Star.

79
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,188
Yeah?

80
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,107
Is today the day...?

81
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,402
Will this be the moment
when you surpass god?

82
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:55,113
Yeah...
just watch me.

83
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,283
Okay, guys...
Are we ready?

84
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,100
Hey, wait a second...!

85
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,394
That's not what he
looked like a minute ago!

86
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,104
Yeah, he got a lot bigger.

87
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:30,023
No fair!

88
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,859
He must have killed Arachne
and swallowed her soul!

89
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,528
I couldn't care less what
you look like, Kishin...

90
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,781
I'm still gonna destroy you...

91
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,282
Got it?!

92
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,951
Insects...

93
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,870
Yummy.

94
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:46,915
Come closer, little insects.

95
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,042
Listen up!

96
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,419
Soul is about to play...

97
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,338
Everyone ready?

98
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,478
Showtime...! Now...

99
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,605
Soul... play it!

100
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,703
Impossible.

101
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:28,456
That girl is combining
two incredible powers.

102
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,920
Black blood and Genie Hunter
working together?

103
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,630
Let's go!

104
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:42,429
His skin is as hard as armor!

105
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,556
Our attacks are
working, though...

106
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,516
Let's keep it coming!

107
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,352
You ready to go, Maka?

108
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,361
Damn...! Are you
sure this is working?

109
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,573
Yes, I'm positive...
Just look around you.

110
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,826
Up there!

111
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:07,495
The barrier he set up
is starting to weaken...

112
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,706
That's proof we're
doing something.

113
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,957
It does look a bit thinner.

114
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,834
That's good, right?

115
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,337
We're resonating
well together, too...

116
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,006
If we keep this up,
we can beat him!

117
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:22,635
What's happening...?
Something's off.

118
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,305
It feels like I'm forgetting
something important...

119
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,891
...something I need to remember.

120
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,768
But what is it?

121
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,405
Keep going...!
Let's pick up the tempo!

122
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,657
Hey, Soul!
Are you even listening to us?

123
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:47,535
Quit your whining!
Of course I'm listening to you.

124
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,246
You guys just shut up and
pay attention to my playing.

125
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,457
Faster now...!
Get ready!

126
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,001
We're building to the climax.

127
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,975
Fire Death Cannon!

128
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,702
Genie Hunt--

129
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,094
Soul!

130
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,646
This is the end
of the line, Soul.

131
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,024
You've played your last tune...

132
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,818
It's my world now.

133
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:07,032
Soul!!!

134
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:16,124
That's impossible.
No way!

135
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,209
He's still as good as new...

136
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:21,212
There's no sign
of a single injury.

137
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,431
The surgery went well.

138
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:33,016
We just need
to keep him stable...

139
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,019
Given enough time,
he should make a full recovery.

140
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:36,811
Yeah...

141
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:38,355
That's good to hear...

142
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,023
...but still...

143
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,524
Still what?

144
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,901
It's just that...

145
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,820
I said something I'll never
be able to take back...

146
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,906
I told Crona
I didn't trust him...

147
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:51,284
...that I never would again
unless we recovered you.

148
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:53,495
I was there with
him the whole time...

149
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,206
...but I couldn't keep him
from getting injured...

150
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,250
He's hurt because I forced
him into fighting Medusa...

151
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:02,045
It's all my fault.

152
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:04,172
So why not tell him that?

153
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:08,051
Crona's going to be all right...

154
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:10,470
You can tell him how you
feel when he wakes up...

155
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:12,639
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

156
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:21,690
Crona...! Are you okay...?

157
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:22,899
Crona?

158
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:25,360
Can't stay.
I have to go.

159
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:29,155
I have to go find Maka.

160
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,332
You're persistent...

161
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,501
How long are you
going to keep this up...

162
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,586
They've obviously betrayed you.

163
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,046
Oh, don't worry...

164
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,090
I'm going pay them
back with interest.

165
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:50,468
But before I do that,
I'm gonna take care of you!

166
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,512
Who's next on this list?

167
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,139
Who do you think?

168
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:57,350
It'll be that old hag, Arachne.

169
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:58,435
Oh, really...?

170
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,520
Well, I guess
you can always try...

171
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:03,356
...but I think you'll find it's
a little too late for that.

172
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,483
What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,069
Someone beat you to it.
She's already dead.

174
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,529
She is?!

175
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,865
Haven't you noticed you're
the only one still fighting?

176
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:14,325
Everyone else
has begun to retreat.

177
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:17,704
Arachnophobia's destroyed.
You're alone.

178
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,414
There's no way!

179
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,374
You have a decision to make...

180
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,170
DWMA troops will be
flooding in here soon...

181
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:29,632
You can run or fight
all of them by yourself.

182
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:31,926
Fine!
You lucky punk.

183
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,304
I'll go easy on you today!

184
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:37,015
Cat got your tongue?

185
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,685
Just remember one thing...

186
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,314
[BOTH] I'm still gonna kick
your ass someday!

187
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:46,024
Look at that...

188
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,860
I know you so well I can
predict your foul language.

189
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,695
Shut up!

190
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,906
I've had enough,
you damn priest...!

191
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:55,950
The next time we meet,
you're not gonna be so lucky!

192
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,036
Remember that!

193
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:07,754
What is it?

194
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,798
A barrier the Kishin created...

195
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,841
We think it's similar
to the Death Room...

196
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,095
...impenetrable
from the outside.

197
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,513
I see.

198
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:19,391
The spread of the madness
hasn't even slowed down...

199
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,643
I don't know what
more we can try to do...

200
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:25,146
We made Death City move, but we
still couldn't beat the Kishin.

201
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,816
Fools! What do
you use your eyes for?

202
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,317
Decoration?

203
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,612
His eyes look like a failed
arts and crafts project,

204
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,156
and he's asking me that?!

205
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,075
There's still a slight hope.

206
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,910
What are you talking about?

207
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,704
Three meisters made it inside...

208
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,038
Death the Kid's there...

209
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:42,872
...with Black Star...

210
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,040
...and Maka Albarn.

211
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,459
They all have their
weapons with them...

212
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:49,170
The battle's not over.
We've still got a chance.

213
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,506
Maka and the
others are in there?!

214
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,508
Victory still
isn't very likely...

215
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:57,137
...but if Maka can use her Genie
Hunter move, then maybe...

216
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,471
Yes, you're right...

217
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:01,099
If Maka can harness enough
power at the right time,

218
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:03,518
then she might be able
to defeat the Kishin.

219
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,812
That doesn't change
anything for us up here.

220
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:07,522
Huh?

221
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:08,982
All we can do...

222
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:10,900
...is stand here and watch.

223
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,114
Soul...! Soul!

224
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:18,033
Wake up!!

225
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,744
What's going on?
What happened?

226
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,495
Why's he just lying there?!

227
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,123
I don't understand what's
wrong with him, either...

228
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,499
Maybe...

229
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,127
Your friend bit off
more than he could chew.

230
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,628
He what?

231
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:33,923
What the--where did he go?

232
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,346
He did whatever he had to in
order to push all your powers

233
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,222
to their maximum potential,

234
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,808
which increased the
burden on himself.

235
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:47,145
This has been a long
time coming, indeed.

236
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,731
Because of the black
blood he has in his body?

237
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,983
Every power comes
with a price...

238
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,777
In this case,
it was his sanity...

239
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,737
...but he wasn't
willing to give it up...

240
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,155
He wanted both...

241
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:58,490
If he had just given in,

242
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,785
everything would have
been different.

243
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:05,330
If he'd done that, he would
have known a life without fear.

244
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:07,749
But he refused...

245
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:11,753
...and chose instead to
pointlessly destroy himself.

246
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,465
Shut up, jack ass!

247
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,883
You don't know what
you're talking about!

248
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:17,759
Quiet...!

249
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,427
He's trying to provoke us...!

250
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,763
We can't afford to get
caught up in that.

251
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:23,056
Why should I care...?

252
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,099
This is my show.

253
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,226
He can say anything
he wants to me.

254
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,854
One way or another,
he's still gonna die today!

255
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:33,817
No way...!

256
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,152
He did that using only
his wavelength?!

257
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,696
I shouldn't be surprised...

258
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,614
It is Black Star.

259
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,826
But we still have a problem...

260
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,119
With Soul out cold,

261
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,663
we have no one to
synchronize our wavelengths.

262
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,873
Kid, we've gotta keep going!

263
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,459
Yeah...
I know that!

264
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,431
He's not even flinching.

265
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,224
We have to gain some
ground before the

266
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:08,768
Kishin decides to
strike back at us.

267
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,108
Or we're going to lose.

268
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,612
His pulse is getting weaker...

269
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:22,073
...and he's
starting to turn pale.

270
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,325
If this keeps up...

271
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,785
Please, Soul...

272
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,370
Please come back.

273
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,164
What are you doing?!

274
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:31,374
Go get Soul!

275
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,918
Maka, you're the only one
who can save him now...

276
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,337
It's all up to you.

277
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,381
Hurry up and bring
that idiot back!

278
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,300
Kid, Black Star...

279
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:41,634
...are you sure?

280
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,219
Do what you need to...

281
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,471
I promise...

282
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,890
...we'll find a way to
keep the Kishin back.

283
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,350
What are you talking about...?

284
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,894
By the time she's back,
it'll all be over...

285
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,104
It's just too bad
for you, Maka...

286
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:54,981
Unfortunately, looks
like you're gonna miss

287
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,859
the chance to watch
my best show yet.

288
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:01,446
Foolish children...
You can't save him.

289
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,615
Stop talking...

290
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,825
This decision doesn't concern
you even in the slightest!

291
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,204
You should shut up and start
getting ready to fight me!

292
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,416
Good luck.

293
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,923
Soul... I'm coming for you.

294
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:28,682
It's weak, but I can feel it...
Soul's wavelength.

295
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,985
Wha...
...what's that?

296
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,369
What's going on here?

297
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,780
That sound...

298
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,283
I hear a piano...

299
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,285
That's Soul.

300
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,044
I've been waiting for you, Maka.

301
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:06,423
Is it you?

302
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:12,429
Yeah...
Who were you expecting?

303
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:29,863
Are you okay?

304
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,033
I'm...

305
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,743
...so...

306
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,244
...bored.

307
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:41,791
Now...

308
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,793
...die.

309
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,184
I'm not gonna let
you hurt them...

310
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:00,852
...ever...

311
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:03,980
...see I made a promise
to a friend of mine.

312
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,483
We keep the promises we make...

313
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,276
It's an academy thing...

314
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,695
You wouldn't get it.

315
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:16,326
Kishin Asura...
You die today.

316
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:21,414
♪ closing song ♪

317
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:51,004
Yahoo...! Let's go, Tsubaki!
It's our time to shine!

318
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:51,880
Shine...?

319
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,214
Yeah... sure...

320
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,299
What's up with you?

321
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:56,301
You don't seem
as chipper as normal.

322
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:58,887
It's something that's been
bothering me for a while now...

323
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,722
Do you really want
to hear about it?

324
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:01,556
Uh...

325
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,141
...sure... why not.

326
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,726
We weapons hardly get any lines

327
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,895
when we're in our
non-human forms.

328
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,938
On the next episode
