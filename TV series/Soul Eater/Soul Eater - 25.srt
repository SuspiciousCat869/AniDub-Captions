[Maka]
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:47,537
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,331
...and a sound body.

00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:00,008
[Justin] It's been
many years since

5
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,511
the last time I set
foot on this ground.

6
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,223
Oh, great lord... Please...

7
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:11,478
Grant the people comfortable
lives and dignified deaths.

Crona...

10
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,748
It's okay, really...

11
00:02:56,124 --> 00:02:57,751
I promise you.

12
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:03,840
I wonder how
he's doing now.

13
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,178
Aw, man.

14
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,890
[Sid]
About the Demon Sword...

15
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,433
[Death]
Hmm?

16
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:15,977
He surrendered to us after
the battle under the school,

17
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,896
so we've taken
him into custody...

18
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:20,065
...but I think you should be
the one to decide how he's

19
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:22,776
dealt with now
that we have him.

20
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,570
[Death]
Yes, I should...

21
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,823
Is there something
bothering you, sir?

22
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,825
[Death] Yes...
There's something...

23
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,745
...strange about
the Demon Sword.

24
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:36,081
What do you mean, by 'strange'?

25
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:37,499
[Death] The Demon
Sword has devoured

26
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,834
a great number of
human souls, right...?

27
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:44,255
So we'd expect him to be well
on his way to becoming a Kishin.

28
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,802
But nothing could be
further from the truth.

29
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,345
[Sid]
What do you mean?

30
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,305
[Death] I don't know how
it's even possible...

31
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:53,515
...but I guess you could say

32
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,433
it seems like something
has had a sort of...

33
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:58,812
...purifying effect
on him recently.

34
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:00,897
What do you think about it, Sid?

35
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,066
I don't have
the slightest idea...

36
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,943
But I do think we need
to hold the Demon Sword

37
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:08,279
accountable for all the
horrible things he's done.

38
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,865
I realize he's a child
and he was led by a witch,

39
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,493
but we can't ignore his actions.

40
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,120
I think the same
severe punishment

41
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,663
that we always use for cases

42
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,790
like this should
apply here as well.

43
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:21,334
Don't you agree?

44
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,253
[Death]
Hmmm...

45
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,338
[Sid]
Hmm...?

46
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:29,801
[Death] Dunno...
so I think I'm gonna put it off.

47
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,140

Scythes Convene...

Hey! What're you doing?

50
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,355
Just come on.

51
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,690
I'm not coming anywhere...

52
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,066
Lord Death specifically told us

53
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,569
to stay put until our
injuries are all healed.

54
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,279
Seriously...

55
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:52,532
If ya stay put any longer
than you already have...

56
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:53,533
Look...

57
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,743
You'll start sprouting
mushrooms,

58
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:55,577
and that's not cool.

59
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,870
[Maka]
I will not.

60
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:57,620
Oh come on.

61
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:58,872
You know you want to.

62
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,498
What are you planning, Soul?

63
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:02,959
Just a little change of pace.

64
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:04,210
Huh?

65
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,712
[Black Star]
Yo!

66
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,053
[Death]
On to the next issue...

67
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:14,637
Including Spirit,

68
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,681
what's our head count looking
like so far for the gathering

69
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,516
of the eight Death Scythes?

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,684
[Sid]
Well...

71
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,603
It appears that Justin
has now arrived...

72
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:24,022
Counting Spirit and the other
two that got in earlier,

73
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:25,732
we have a total of four.

74
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,942
[Death] Okay, we've got
half of them at least...

75
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,652
What're the other four up to?

76
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,113
It looks like the ones in
charge of Europe and West Asia

77
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:35,033
are too busy with work and
can't make it here right now.

78
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:36,159
[Death]
That's no good...

79
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,243
What about the one we've

80
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,496
got stationed down
in South America?

81
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,707
It's kinda hard to tell with
all the growling and barking.

82
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,000
And Africa?

83
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,336
Yeah, they won't take our calls.

84
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,342
[Death] Well... I guess
four of 'em is just gonna

85
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,635
have to be good enough...

86
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,345
Here's hoping.

87
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,645
[Marie]
Ugh. No, no, no.

88
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,021
[Yumi]
What's wrong with you?

89
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:06,356
What's wrong with me...?

90
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,941
This is not where I
should be right now,

91
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,401
that's what's wrong.

92
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,529
There are more important
things I need to be doing.

93
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,948
[Yumi]
Don't be ridiculous...

94
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:17,534
There's a Kishin out
walking the earth again...

95
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,495
What could possibly be more
important than dealing with it?

96
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:21,579
You're still young.

97
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,707
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

98
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,083
All I want to do is retire

99
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,459
and find myself a
good husband,

100
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:29,254
but I still get all this
work dumped on me...

101
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,006
Doesn't that seem unfair?!

102
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,466
When there's work to be done,
we don't have a choice.

103
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,927
I devote myself completely
to every man I date,

104
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,929
but they always
end up dumping me.

105
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:39,931
Have you ever thought that
maybe your devotion puts so

106
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,182
much pressure on them that

107
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,310
they feel the need to
run away from you?

108
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,149
[Marie] You don't understand
the power of love!

109
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,110
Yeah, maybe you're
right about that...

110
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,404
but you don't understand
the power of your punches.

111
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,322
[Marie]
Oh... sorry.

112
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,076
Anyway... it's old
fashioned to think that only

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,871
marriage can make
a woman happy.

114
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,129
Okay, Marie, what is it now?

115
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,047
[Marie]
I've decided...

116
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,091
I'm going to marry this toilet.

117
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,885
That's it! It'll be perfect...!

118
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,887
After all, what's more
accepting than a toilet?

119
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,472
It'll take anything
and everything!

120
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,766
It's an ideal husband!

121
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:25,852
Hold on a second.

122
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,354
Let's just think this over.

123
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,731
Wouldn't it be annoying when
the toilet seat was left up?

124
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:30,607
I can live with that.

125
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,858
It's not a big deal.

126
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,817
[Yumi]
Oh no...!

127
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,153
I've got to stop her!

128
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:36,946
Uh... Okay,
but nobody's perfect.

129
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,365
Even the toilet might complain

130
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:41,659
a bit if you put more pressure
on it than it can take.

131
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,161
And I hate to tell you this,

132
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,747
but he could secretly spring
a leak without you knowing.

133
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,792
[Marie]
A leak...? How indecent.

134
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,794
It's over...

135
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,839
You dirty cheater!

136
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:58,176
[Marie] Okay...!
We can go see Lord Death now.

137
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,221
And Marie the
Pulverizer strikes again.

138
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:04,808
She won't be
retiring any time soon.

139
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:16,820
[Death Scythe]
Need something?

140
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:21,324
[Stein] Yes... We need to go and
check in with Lord Death.

141
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,201
Nope. I'm not goin'. Sorry.

142
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:24,786
And why's that?

143
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:25,995
[Death Scythe]
Tell me this, Stein...

144
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,497
Why do you think Lord Death

145
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,917
is gathering all the other
Death Scythes here at the DWMA?

146
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,211
Because the Kishin's revived
and we need to come up

147
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,755
with a plan quickly before it
can do any more damage.

148
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,090
No, you're wrong...

149
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,342
Lord Death's totally
planning to send me away...

150
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:40,844
Transferred and demoted.

151
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,387
Oh... yeah?

152
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,014
I mean, think about it!

153
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:46,349
If I'd only stayed with
him like I'm supposed to,

154
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,185
he woulda been able
to use me to defeat Asura.

155
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,854
[Stein] So now you're
polishing sconces

156
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,605
to earn some points with him?

157
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:53,898
That a problem?

158
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,067
[Stein]
Wow, you are dumb.

159
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,780
Yeah, well, I'm a little
desperate here, Stein...

160
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:03,700
I don't want my ex-wife
to take full custody of Maka...

161
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:06,369
If that happens, I won't
ever get to see my little girl,

162
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:07,454
and then it'll hardly even

163
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,164
feel like I'm
her father anymore.

164
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,666
It already hardly
seems like you are.

165
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,670
You're actually desperate
enough to roll up your sleeves

166
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,172
and do some hard labor.

167
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,342
That's right! And I'll roll 'em
up even more if I have to.

168
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,135
Look over there.

169
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:23,595
It's Stein, your first love.

170
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,805
[Marie] I don't know what
you're talking about.

171
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:29,267
Hey...! Long time no see.

172
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,102
Hello you two.

173
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,479
It's her.

174
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,981
[Death Scythe and Stein]
Queen of Committee Chairmen

175
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:39,069
You were always an annoying,
bossy brat, Azusa.

176
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:40,653
Yes, I remember you complaining

177
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,906
every time I tried to
dismember a passer-by.

178
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,991
I'm with her on that.

179
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,286
[Yumi] Wouldn't you say the
Kishin's revival was largely

180
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,705
a result of your
blundering ineptitude?

181
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,999
Hey, now! Let's not go sayin'
stuff like that when we're

182
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,376
in front of Lord Death, okay?

183
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,960
[Yumi] I don't know if
that'll be possible...

184
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:59,172
I have a tendency to
speak my mind at all times.

185
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,007
Come to think of it, Marie...

186
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:02,759
Weren't you planning to retire

187
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:04,844
right after you became
a Death Scythe?

188
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,971
Please don't remind me.

189
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,141
All right...! There will
be no more talking.

190
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,435
Lord Death is waiting
for us in the Death Room.

191
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,062
Everyone line up!

192
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,772
At attention!

193
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,484
[Death Scythe and Stein]
Here we go again.

194
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,528
[Justin]
Oh!

195
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:22,904
Great Lord...!

196
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,948
Why will you not speak
your magnificent words that

197
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,991
I may hear them
and swiftly obey?

198
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,077
[Death]
Uhh...

199
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,497
Ooohhh...! This is a tragedy!

200
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,833
I am unable to hear your voice.

201
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,544
[Death] Umm...
actually, you should--

202
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,379
Take out the ear phones!

203
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:40,880
Huh?

204
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,758
It's good to
see you all again...

205
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:48,972
Justin, at your
service as always.

206
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:52,100
[Death] Thank you for coming
all this way, Death Scythes.

207
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:54,227
Now, then, let's get
down to business...

208
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,563
I assume you already know
why I've called you to the

209
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,024
DWMA on such short notice.

210
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,025
Please no transfer...!

211
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,943
Please no transfer!

212
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,238
[Death]
The Kishin Asura,

213
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:07,907
a former member of my
personal guard, has revived.

214
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,119
Obviously,
we need to discuss this.

215
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,038
Despite Asura's
incredible strength,

216
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:15,165
he's still a
big old scardey cat...

217
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:18,668
I doubt he will make
any moves this early on.

218
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,254
This means the most pressing
task for us at the moment

219
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,007
is not determining how
to counteract Asura's actions,

220
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,759
but establishing a strategy for

221
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:28,428
dealing with his
madness wavelengths.

222
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:30,597
That's the real danger now.

223
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,766
Stein, could you answer any
questions the others may

224
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,809
have about these wavelengths?

225
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:35,935
Yes.

226
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,562
What are they, exactly...?

227
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,105
Can we consider them comparable

228
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:41,649
to the soul wavelengths
of the Kishin?

229
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,986
Yes... but these wavelengths
are on a godly level.

230
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,072
What makes the
wavelengths so dangerous?

231
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:48,406
What can they do?

232
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,866
[Stein] Everyone in
the world possesses

233
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,410
at least a small
amount of madness.

234
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,915
I am no exception.

235
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,583
Asura's madness wavelengths

236
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,670
rouse the insanity that
sleeps deep in people's souls,

237
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:04,631
magnifying it.

238
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:07,550
The madness
spreads like a disease.

239
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:12,097
I could feel the waves of it
the moment Asura was revived.

240
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,182
[Stein insanely laughs]

241
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,522
A plague of madness.

242
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,108
And you're saying anybody
can feel its effects?

243
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,526
Not quite.

244
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:27,112
It might be relatively difficult
for a person like Justin

245
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,447
to be infected by the madness.

246
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,616
Also... for the time being,

247
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,993
at least, I think the
outbreak will be limited...

248
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:36,037
I doubt it will have
much effect on ordinary

249
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,790
people as they go
about their daily business.

250
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:42,002
Then, what major problem
does the madness pose initially?

251
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:44,671
[Yumi] It will
strengthen the wicked.

252
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:45,880
[Stein]
That's correct...

253
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,424
For example, dismembering living

254
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:49,467
things has always
intrigued me...

255
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,011
The madness enhances that.

256
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:52,303
[Death]
And?

257
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:53,680
[Stein]
There's much more...

258
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:55,390
The wavelengths will
awaken witches

259
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:56,641
who are now dormant...

260
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,601
...and they will affect
more than just people...

261
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:01,521
Natural disasters,
unusual weather phenomena...

262
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:04,149
All sorts of horrors
are possible.

263
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,316
Enemies who have been

264
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,278
inactive for a long time
will begin moving.

265
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,239
The reason we're
in this situation...

266
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,616
...is the blundering
of these two idiots.

267
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,452
[Yumi] Lord Death, have you
given any thought as to what

268
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:18,663
should be done with them?

269
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,332
[Death]
Yes... about that...

270
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,459
[Death Scythe]
No transfer!

271
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,336
Anything but
reassignment, please!

272
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:26,546
[Death] I'm thinking a very
slight staff reassignment

273
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:28,298
might be in order.

274
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:33,887
[Death Scythe]
What?! No!

275
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,767
My happy life
with my daughter.

276
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,852
It's gone...! Gone for good...!

277
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:43,563
What future can I
ever have now...?

278
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:46,066
How am I gonna
explain this to Maka...?

279
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:48,902
I don't wanna see the sad
look on her dear little face!

280
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:51,029
[Death]
No, no... Calm down, Spirit...

281
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,406
You're still going to
be my personal weapon.

282
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,035
Are you really
going to keep me?!

283
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,745
[Death] You shouldn't
be so surprised...!

284
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,330
You are the only Death Scythe

285
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:01,956
who is actually
a Death Scythe...

286
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,584
Have a little more
confidence in yourself.

287
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:08,672
Oh, Lord...! You are truly
a kind and benevolent ruler.

288
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:11,549
Recently I've sent you off
to serve as Stein's temporary

289
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,134
weapon whenever
he needed you...

290
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,594
That has to change...

291
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,763
You must avoid leaving
the academy as much as

292
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,973
physically possible from now on.

293
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,684
Understood, sir!

294
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,060
[Death]
One other change...

295
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,104
I think we should have
an additional Death Scythe

296
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:28,817
stationed here to help
fortify the DWMA's defenses.

297
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,736
Marie... I'm assigning
that duty to you...

298
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,197
I'd like you to be
Stein's new partner.

299
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,449
Huh...? Why me?

300
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:37,992
Oh no!

301
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,786
Please, you can't be serious...!

302
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,414
I've completely lost the
motivation to work...!

303
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,374
I even chose to be in
charge of Oceania because

304
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,960
I knew it would be
peaceful and easy...

305
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,587
If I'm always busy here
at the academy it'll take me

306
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:52,048
even longer to find a husband!

307
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,633
[Stein]
It's okay...

308
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,386
I have a feeling your obsessive
tendencies will come in handy.

309
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,430
[Marie]
Don't say that.

310
00:14:58,513 --> 00:14:59,597
Lord Death, sir...

311
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,850
What task would
you like me to take?

312
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,351
[Death]
You'll use your wide field

313
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,270
of vision to locate Asura...

314
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,980
...wherever he's run off to.

315
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:10,150
You'll also be in charge
of Oceania while Marie is

316
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,609
stationed here at the school.

317
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,111
Right.

318
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,781
[Death]
And as for your task, Justin.

319
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,867
Uh, Justin?

320
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,375
Well, never mind Justin for now!

321
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,295
Obviously, life here at the
DWMA is going to have

322
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:31,921
to change in the coming weeks...

323
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:37,177
We're entering a difficult time,
but at least it'll be exciting!

324
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,096
Okay! Class dismissed.

325
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:45,143
[Death]
Oh, hang back a second, Spirit.

326
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,062
[Death Scythe]
Yes, sir?

327
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,272
[Death] There's something
you and I need to discuss...

328
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,774
...in private.

329
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,367
[Black Star] All right!
Let's play some basketball!

330
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,868
Yeah!

331
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:03,953
Hey, Maka!

332
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,288
Get over here!

333
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:06,414
Why should I...?

334
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,582
You said you were fine

335
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,209
with me reading a
book on the sidelines.

336
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,711
That's the only reason
I agreed to come.

337
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:13,421
Well I lied. Sorry...

338
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,009
[Black Star]
It's not my fault, you know!

339
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:21,054
Liz suddenly flaked out on us,
so now we need you to play.

340
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:22,514
What am I supposed to do?

341
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,307
I don't know how to play this.

342
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,100
Here...

343
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:26,393
...it's for your hair.

344
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:27,769
All right. Three on three.

345
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,270
These teams should
work for right now.

346
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,480
Hey, Kid...

347
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,148
Why couldn't Liz come
out and play today?

348
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,110
Something about nice nails
that took a long time to grow...

349
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,737
A regular game of
basketball would be boring...

350
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,948
Let's say the losing
captain gets a punishment.

351
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,950
That oughta make
things more interesting.

352
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:43,326
Yeah, sounds good...

353
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,869
What're the punishments?

354
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,705
[Soul] If we lose,
we'll move the picture frames

355
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,164
in Kid's place two centimeters.

356
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:49,833
[Kid]
Whoa whoa whoa!

357
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,167
That would be interesting.

358
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,169
All right. And if we lose,
then Captain Maka here

359
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:54,379
has to spend a whole day

360
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,172
hanging out with
her creepy old man.

361
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,132
Huh?!

362
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,008
Hold on!

363
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,342
That doesn't make any sense...!

364
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,219
Don't you wanna
be captain, Black Star?

365
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:02,971
You'll be the
center of attention!

366
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:05,223
It's so hard...!

367
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:07,642
But I feel really bad
for forcing you to play!

368
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,227
It'll be a sacrifice,

369
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,522
but I'll regretfully surrender
my captain duties to you, Maka.

370
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:15,191
You have to decide now
not to be an attention hog?

371
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,402
[Patty] You are wearing
the captain's cap, Maka.

372
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,070
Huh...?!
That's what you gave me?

373
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,781
Damn it...! I wanna be captain!

374
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:22,699
Fine with me.

375
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,409
Let's switch!

376
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,037
Okay, here we go.

377
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,912
Bring it on.

378
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,748
Huh?
Soul isn't on our team.

379
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,583
What's he doing
passing it to Black Star?

380
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,751
[Black Star]
Here.

381
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,170
Huh? Why'd Black
Star pass it back?

382
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,963
Right... let's do it.

383
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,174
Patty...! Captain Maka...

384
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,717
Zone defense, okay?

385
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,968
'Kay!

386
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:43,178
What's a zone...?

387
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,430
Somebody please tell me!

388
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,390
Now we're starting?

389
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,933
Stop you guys! Wait!

390
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:52,312
--Soul...! Pass! Pass!
--This is absolutely hopeless.

391
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:53,271
How am I supposed
to find a husband

392
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,522
in a place that's full of kids?

393
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,067
It'll be impossible!

394
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,281
Hey, nice shooting, Kid!

395
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,575
Are they students from the DWMA?

396
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:09,371
Yes... And they're your
students starting tomorrow.

397
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,247
That was a foul, Maka.

398
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:12,791
You can't double
dribble the ball.

399
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,167
Come on, you're the captain!

400
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,669
Shouldn't you know better?

401
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:18,088
Huh? I don't get it,
what's a double dribble?.

402
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:20,507
I mean it sounds kinda cool.

403
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,761
Oh-kay...

404
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:26,388
I don't have a boyfriend
right now, anyway.

405
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,890
I guess I might
as well do some work.

406
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,642
Oh, yeah, I forgot...

407
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:31,976
Everything's happened
so quickly.

408
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll need to stay at
your place until

409
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,730
I can find an
apartment in town.

410
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,023
[Stein] That's fine,

411
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,692
but don't blame me if you
wind up dismembered.

412
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:41,236
[Marie] I have
complete faith in you.

413
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:44,197
[Death Scythe]
What is it, sir?

414
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,198
[Death]
Actually...

415
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,867
I need to talk to
you about Stein.

416
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,871
I'm pretty sure he's
realized it himself...

417
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:55,250
but his old madness is beginning
to take hold of him again.

418
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,336
[Death Scythe]
So you put him with Marie?

419
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,797
[Death] I think she's the best
partner for him right now.

420
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,507
Her soul wavelength
should have a positive

421
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,844
effect on the
madness inside him.

422
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,303
So, Spirit...

423
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,347
You're Stein's former partner...

424
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,182
Can I ask you to
keep an eye on his

425
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,976
situation for me as well?

426
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,686
[Death Scythe]
Yes.

427
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,773
Sheesh...

428
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,402
Is he always going to be
this much of a headache?

429
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:24,529
[Players shouting
out during game]

430
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:25,530
Hey.

431
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,824
Oh I didn't see
you there, Spirit.

432
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,535
What're they doing here...?

433
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:33,204
Didn't we tell 'em to stay
at home so they can heal?

434
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:36,666
I'm always amazed by
how carefree kids can be.

435
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,214
[Death Scythe]
I wouldn't call it carefree.

436
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,842
They just had the biggest
battle of their lives.

437
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:46,968
They're trying to regain

438
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,095
some normalcy in
their own way.

439
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:51,598
[Soul]
Game over...!

440
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,141
Final score: 20 to 4.

441
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,643
Maka's team loses.

442
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,646
--Pun...ish...ment...!
--I never even figured out
how to play the game!

443
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,148
Pun...ish...ment...!

444
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,358
Pun...ish...ment!

445
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,526
Whew...! Glad it's not me!

446
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,695
Maybe we should let
her off the hook.

447
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,906
I'm not so sure about that...

448
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,115
This doesn't seem much

449
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,034
more normal than
that fight underground...

450
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,953
It's still two sides
fighting for different goals.

451
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,205
Jeez, Stein...

452
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:16,664
A simple game like basketball,

453
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,584
and you still just can't
quite get it, can you?

454
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,674
Oh... Hey, what's
going on, Maka?

455
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,591
[Maka]
U-Umm...

456
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,135
...ya see... Papa...

457
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,262
Do... do you want
to hang out...

458
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,348
...like... Saturday?

459
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:42,816
[Death Scythe thinks] I never
thought this day would come!

460
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,652
To think, I almost
got sent away today!

461
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:46,903
[Maka in a dream] Hey, Papa!
Which do you want:

462
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:49,155
strawberry or banana?

463
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,950
Which shirt do you
think'll look better on me?

464
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,451
[Death Scythe]
It's cold out.

465
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:54,369
[Maka]
Thanks, Papa!

466
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,204
It's so nice and warm!

467
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:59,708
I... I thought Maka
was looking for normalcy!

468
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,752
Papa?

00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:11,011
Are you okay?

472
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:12,345
Sorry...

473
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,015
It's just that I'm so happy!

474
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:15,890
Hang on!

475
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,183
I'll get some medicine for you!

476
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,768
No-- it's really--

477
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,186
I'm okay!

00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,653
I guess that's one more
thing I don't understand.

481
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,699
[Sid]
Lord Death...

482
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,784
You put it off before,

483
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,494
but I think we need to
decide what to do

484
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,163
with the Demon Sword.

485
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,289
[Death]
All right then...

486
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,041
I've made up my mind...

487
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,376
We'll enroll him in the academy!

488
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,753
Seriously?

489
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,297
[Death]
Yes, of course seriously.

490
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,590
Really... Not joking...

491
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:50,884
That's my decision.

492
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,177
The kid has some major

493
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,054
issues we'll have
to deal with, I know...

494
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:55,972
...but if we guide him
carefully enough,

495
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:59,267
he'll become an excellent
ally for the DWMA...

496
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,812
We could really use someone
like him on our side right now.

497
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,230
[Sid]
I understand...

498
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:07,942
But he's still in no condition
to enroll in classes.

499
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,736
[Death]
I agree with you...

500
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,155
That's why we'll move slowly...

501
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:16,076
His trial enrollment in the
academy begins tomorrow!

502
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,164
♪ closing song ♪

503
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,001
[Death Scythe]
It connects!

504
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,669
[Yumi] Yes... Finally,
all the seemingly

505
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,421
unrelated incidents
are connected.

506
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:52,422
[Death Scythe]
No, not that!

507
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:53,506
[Yumi] Do you mean
the link between

508
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,758
global warming and
human overuse of--

509
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:55,800
[Death Scythe]
No no no!

510
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:56,885
[Yumi]
Okay, what then...?

511
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,178
Are you doing a
connect-the-dots puzzle?

512
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,471
[Death Scythe]
Please! Come on!

513
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:00,972
[Yumi]
Then maybe--

514
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:02,599
[Death Scythe] If you'll shut up
for a second, I'll say it!

515
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,809
[Both] The hip bone's
connected to the leg bone!

516
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,269
[Death Scythe]
Umm... Azusa?

517
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,229
[Yumi] On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

518
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,774
The Exciting an Embarrassing
Trial Enrollment!

519
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:13,610
The DWMA New Lifestyle
Support Fair is Open?

520
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:16,071
[Death Scythe]
You totally stole my thunder!
