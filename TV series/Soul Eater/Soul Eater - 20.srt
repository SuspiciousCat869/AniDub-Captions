...dwells within a sound mind...

00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,083
...and a sound body.

[Black Star] Fine...
he's all yours.

No stupid moves.

Gimme a shout if you
get yourself into trouble...

Thanks for the support.

after Kid and the others.

Right.

[Black Star]
See ya! Have fun!

19
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,333
That's okay.
I can handle this...

20
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:10,166
People are easier to deal with
when their backs are turned.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,583

22
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,041
No way!

23
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,750
Hey, that's no fair.

24
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,291
[Soul]
Nice punch...!

25
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,250
Cutting him won't do any good
because of the black blood,

26
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,458
so more impact strikes
like that are what we need.

27
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,750
[Maka]
We have to stop him here.

28
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,500
We'll do a Scythe Catch
then a left rush.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,583
His body's so hard it feels
like I'm punching lead.

about the brat who ran off and

32
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,083

right in front of you.

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,333
Round one goes to me!

34
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,833
[Crona]
I don't understand.

35
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,583
Why am I suddenly
all beat up...?

I don't know what to do.

37
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,791
How am I supposed to deal

38
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,791
with a girl who keeps
punching me like that?

39
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,666
[Ragnarok]
Kill her.

[Soul]
I think we can safely say

41
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,333
your first attack
went well enough...

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,583
But let's face it...

43
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,291
...you picked a fight
with the Demon Sword...

chance of winning?

Nope, not really.

How're you so smart,

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,500
yet so stupid at
the same time, Maka?

50

This is awesome...

Yeah, I'll figure something out.

00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,791
[Ragnarok]
Don't be an idiot, girl...

56
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,166
You're not gonna 
'manage' anything...

57

Don't you remember
how this went last time...?

58
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:44,166
You and your weapon
didn't 'manage' so well.

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,500
I don't know why I
bother with you anyway...

60
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,208
A puny little soul like yours
is hardly even worth eating.

61
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,958
That star brat from earlier
looked a lot tastier than you.

62
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,458
You're an unappetizing,
useless little girl...

63
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,916
I don't even
need to fight you...

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,125
I could probably bully
you to death from here.

00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,416

Hurray.

[Ragnarok]
Huh?

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,458
You finally see me
for who I am...

68
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,833
The last time we fought you
only saw me as food,

69
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,916
not as an opponent.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,708
But this time is different...

71
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,958
This time, you're seeing
me as a person.

72
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,416
So I say... 'hurray'...

73
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,666
And as for that
meister of yours...

74
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,500
Why are you always
so nervous...? It's pathetic.

You're such a weakling...

You'll just lose again...

79
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,750
Why do you insist on fighting

80
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,500
when you know
you can't beat me.

81

Don't look at me like that...

That's a determined
stare you're giving me,

and I don't know
how to deal with it...

It's very unsettling.

physically weaker than you,

think I'm going to lose...

00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,791
Oh, and one other thing...

164
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,833
...another part of your theory
that is completely wrong.

165
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:27,125
I didn't abduct the Demon Sword
meister from anywhere.

166
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,250
You see,
Crona is my own child.

167
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,916
Oh dear.

168
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,500
You shouldn't've gotten back up.

169
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,541
[Maka bellows]

170
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,291
Why are you still so
insistent on fighting me...?

171
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,125
You're never going to win.

172
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,958
Just give up...
I'm tired of trying

173
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,250
to figure out how
to deal with you.

174
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,666
[Maka]
He used his blood again.

175
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,125
Cutting attacks like that
are the wrong way to go...

176
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,583
The more he bleeds,
the worse off we're going to be.

177
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,750
Yeah, I know.

178
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,541
But there is one more
thing we can try.

179
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,625
You're right. There is that...

180
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,625
Let's go, Maka.

181
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,875
[Maka and Soul]
Soul Resonance!

182
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,500
[Maka and Soul power up]

183
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,083
C'mon... Get it in gear, Crona!

184
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,625
Scream Resonance!

185
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:26,416
[Ragnarok screams]

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,541
[Soul] We need to increase
our resonance rate!

187
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,000
[Maka bellows]

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,291
Such strong resonance energy!

189
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,166
So it's beginning.

190
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,916
Witch Hunter!

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,583
Screech Gamma!

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,375
Hey Stein,
what's going on out there?

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,958
[Stein] The black blood
is being activated.

194
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,458
[Maka bellows]

195
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,208
Figure-6 Hunter!

196
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,000
Letter-U Hunter!

197
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,541
Oh, really...?

198
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,416
Is that all you've got?

199
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,875
Uhh...

200
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,291
He took those hits
without even blinking.

201
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,416
[Soul] How can a toothpick
like him be so strong?

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
It isn't him, Soul...

203
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,583
His body itself may be weak.

204
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,750
But the black blood flowing

205
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,333
through his veins
strengthens him...

206
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:44,208
Ragnarok hardens Crona's body
so it withstands our blows.

207
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,583
[Crona] All right.
Now it's my turn.

208
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,625
Screech Gamma!

209
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,458
Stop it! Stop it!

210
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,625
Noooo! No no...

211
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,458
No no no noooo! No! 

212
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,125
Stop it! Don't make
me cut your weapon now!

213
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,583
Hey, Soul!

214
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,833
No shut up...!

215
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,416
Maka you have to
stay out of this!

216
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
But if we keep going
at this rate, you'll--

217
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,375
Listen! Just forget about
that other crap, okay...?

218
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,500
You need to keep your
guard up right now!

219
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,708
Come on, Soul...

220
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,625
There's no point in
struggling anymore,

221
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,916
and you know it...

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,375
It's time to wake up
and accept the inevitable.

223
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,416
Let me make you stronger.

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,166
Are you hanging
in there, Soul?

225
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,625
Yeah.

226
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,625
There's something...

227
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,583
I think I almost have it.

228
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,166
[Maka thinks]
I sensed something earlier.

229
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,458
Like there was
no way I could lose.

230
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,583
It's something in Crona's

231
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,458
wavelength that
I can almost grasp.

232
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,791
If I just had more time...

233
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,541
No.

234
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,708
Are you afraid now...?

235
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,166
You remind me
of the little one...

236
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,833
I still don't know how
to deal with it either...

237
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,291
You have that much
in common, at least.

238
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,791
[Medusa]
Now... defeat it, Crona.

239
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,833
[Crona whimpers]

240
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,500
Uhh--uh I can't do it...

241
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,958
I don't know how to deal
with something like this now.

242
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,416
[Crona sniffles]

243
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,916
You're a bad child.

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,625
I want you out of my sight...

245
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,208
This is your punishment...

246
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,708
You'll be locked in this
room for a long, long time,

247
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,208
so get used to it.

248
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,125
[Crona] No! Please pick
another punishment.

249
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,083
It's too dark in here!

250
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,500
I can't see anything...!

251
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:59,458
You can't leave the two
of us alone. Please don't lo--

252
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,000
[Door closes and
the lock is turned]

253
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,500
[Crona crying]
It's so dark in here.

254
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,166
I don't know how to deal
with darkness like this.

255
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,291
[Ragnarok]
Dammit Crona...

256
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,333
Look what you did!

257
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,625
No, Ragnarok.

258
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,000
[Ragnarok]
You got me locked up in here

259
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,916
with you because you
couldn't pull yourself together.

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,541
That hurts! Quit it...!

261
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,791
You're always picking on me,

262
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,250
and it's not nice...

263
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,000
Stop twisting my nose like that.

264
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,833
It hurts... I can't see
anything in here,

265
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,208
but I know I have
a nosebleed now.

266
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,708
[Ragnarok] It's all your
fault, you idiot...!

267
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,541
Take this. And this.

268
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,583
[Crona] Oww...! I'm sorry, okay,
I'm sorry! Just stop it now.

269
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,208
--Please...!This isn't fair.
--And this and this and this...!

270
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,000
Leave me alone
already. Stop it!

[lock being turned]

272
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,333
[Medusa]
You can come out now.

273
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,208
[Crona]
He's so mean!

274
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,208
Ragnarok keeps beating me up...!

275
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,750
It hurts, and I don't like it...

276
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,666
Please make him stop hurting me.

277
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,875
[Medusa] Come... We're picking
up where we left off...

278
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,666
You will defeat
it this time, Crona.

279
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,833
There's no way. I can't do it...

280
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,875
I still don't know how to
deal with something like that.

00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,333

of my sight a little longer.

[door lock turned]

284
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,291
[Ragnarok] Damn it Crona!
You complete idiot!

285
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,625
--Oww. Stop it.
--Take this. And this.

286
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,291
--And how about this!
--You're hurting me again.

287
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,791
--It still isn't enough?
--Leave me alone.

288

[door unlocking]

290
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,625
How many times have
we done this now...?

291
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,791
And how many more times

292
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,250
are we going
to have to do it...?

293
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,875
This is getting
you nowhere, Crona.

294
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:14,291
Heh. Did you know
my blood is black?

295
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,666
[stabbing sound]

296
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,833
Bye bye... you little one.

297
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,666
Come on Soul...

298
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,833
Now is the time to act.

299
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,500
Maka...

300
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,125
You're going to die if
you don't do something...

301
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,875
Why not just leave it to me?

302
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,583
Do away with reason...

303
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,958
Let me make you stronger.

304
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,291
Not happening...!

305
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,041
You can give me power...

306
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,750
That's all.

307
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,666
My reason stays with me.

308
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,375
Oh, no.

309
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,416
You can't beat the

310
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,250
Demon Sword's
madness that way...

311
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,583
You're sadly mistaken if
you think reason and

312
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,041
discipline will give you
the power you need now...

313
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,208
Those aren't enough.

314
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
I've never seen anyone
have it that easy.

315
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,000
Understanding fear then
fighting against it...

316
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,291
...maintaining complete
discipline always...

317
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,291
Those are great powers
in their own right.

318
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,083
Besides, this isn't just
about me anymore...

319
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,000
...if we resonate any higher...

320
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,416
...Maka will be affected too.

321
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,250
Don't be an idiot,
you damn brat.

322
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,250
You're turning into a

323
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,583
pathetic whiner
all of a sudden...

324
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,750
What happened to all that
spirit you used to have?

325
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,541
Where's your drive?

326
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,625
Forget reason!

327
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,458
Just let loose and
go crazy for once!

328
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,166
What kind of life
can you live without a

329
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,583
little bit of
insanity thrown in?

330
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,208
Shut up!
Why are you even talking?

331
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,625
You're just saying
the same damn thing

332
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,833
over and over again.

333
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,541
I'm so sick of listening
to you I could puke.

334
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,833
You're full of crap,

335
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,791
and I don't listen to crap,
you got it!? Huh?

336
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,875
So just shut your stupid

337
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,208
little demon mouth
and take the lead.

338
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,208
I'll decide if I want to

339
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,458
follow you or not
how about that?!

340
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,500
How can I shut my
mouth and take the lead?

341
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,000
I dunno, just point or
something you stupid freak.

342
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,416
Okay, okay...

343
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,625
Let's just cool down
for a second here.

344
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,416
You and I both
want to move forward.

345
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,166
But it isn't going to
work this way.

346
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,875
We can't make progress
if we keep on yelling

347
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,708
at each other like this.

348
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,000
Right?

349
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,375
Yeah.

350
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,625
Now, I invited somebody
over to join us.

351
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,375
You can come in now.

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,958
Huh...? Who's there?

353
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,458
Now that we're all here,
perhaps we can decide

354
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,125
things in a more
agreeable manner.

355
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,166
What do you say?

356
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,208
Maka!

357
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,291
I heard most
of what's going on.

358
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,791
How did you get here...?

359
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,750
What is this some kind
of weird meeting inside

360
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,083
my brain or something?

361
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,375
[Demon]
It's simple, really...

362
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,833
Your souls are
resonating right now.

363
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,250
Is it so difficult to believe

364
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,083
that your minds could
be connected as well?

365
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,166
Alright Demon...

366
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,333
How do I know this

367
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
isn't just some image of
Maka you created.

368
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,416
Why should I trust you? 

369
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,750
You're a very cautious 
young man, aren't you...

370
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,958
Remember, it's your mind
we're inside of now.

371
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,416
You're running the show...

372
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,875
There's only so much
I can do in here.

373
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,291
Maka... Chop!

374
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,333
Yeah, okay... it's Maka.

375
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:46,791
Now then... Why don't we put
on some nice, relaxing music.

376
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,541
[Maka]
You're going to have to lead...

377
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,541
I'm not sure I
know how to do this.

378
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,000
[Soul] It's fine.
Just do whatever.

379
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,625
Five and six
and seven and eight...

380
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,666
[slinky jazz music
begins to play]

381
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,833
I don't understand, Maka.

382
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,875
What are you doing here?

383
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,916
Did you hear the
demon guy's voice too?

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,958
I'm not sure... Maybe...

385
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,333
Thinking about it...

386
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,916
...it is possible I heard
it faintly before...

387
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,666
...back when we fought
the immortal werewolf.

388
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,458
Yes... That would
certainly make sense.

389
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,750
I had entered you
too at that point.

390
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,208
But I was removed
shortly after I got there...

391
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,750
I'm still not sure how, though.

392
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,416
If that's really what happened,
then you shouldn't be here...

393
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,458
You managed to
get rid of the demon.

394
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,250
You might not be so lucky
the next time, you know.

395
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,708
Hey... when our wavelengths
are matched like this...

396
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,833
...you can tell what I'm
thinking... can't you, Soul?

397
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,500
Are you...?

398
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,250
You can't seriously be
thinking of using the

399
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,375
black blood to give yourself
the same madness Crona has!

400
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,541
[Maka]
I knew you'd be angry.

401
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,708
It's something I sensed

402
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,333
when I used Witch Hunter
on him earlier...

403
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,208
...something that I could
almost grasp, but not quite...

404
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,125
If I could be as
powerful as him...

405
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,833
Maybe I would know...

406
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,208
Maybe I could figure out
what I need to about Crona.

407
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:20,083
No way... It's too dangerous to
do that without knowing more...

408
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,083
If you do this you could

409
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,541
end up as crazy
as Crona forever.

410
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,583
[Maka]
Yeah...

411
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,541
I'm sorry, Soul...

412
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,541
I've made up my mind.

413
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,750
We can't be sure
you'll return to normal.

414
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,791
I know, but it's
worth trying, right?

415
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,666
All right. Fine... I give...

416
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,916
Do whatever crazy
things you want to.

417
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Just remember,

418
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,583
no matter how far
away you end up...

419
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,458
I'm still your weapon,
and I will pull you back.

420
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,208
Oww!

421
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,875
[Maka]
Oh, sorry.

422
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,333
You really should lead, okay?

423
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,250
Uh-huh... I see that now.

424
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,125
This is more like it.

[Maka laughs insanely]

426
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,250
Ooooo! He flew!

427
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,458
I'm being pulled into
the madness with her...

428
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,625
Maka... I swear I will
not let go of you.

429
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,958
You're wrong
about that one, fool...

430
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,750
See I'm the one
who's leading now.

it's night outside?
