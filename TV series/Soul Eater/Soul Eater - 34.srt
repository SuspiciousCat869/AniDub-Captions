00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:57,839
[Death] The Magic Tool Brew is
located on an island north

5
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:00,842
of Alaska known as Lost Island.

6
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,263
This island was previously
home to a Magic Tool facility

7
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:07,557
created and
operated by witches...

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,227
However, an accident occurred,
causing a great explosion,

9
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,189
and the facility was destroyed.

10
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,941
[explosion]

11
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,669
[Death] That same accident
created a strong magnetic field

12
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:37,253
in the center of the island...

13
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:38,963
The magnetism is so powerful

14
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,758
that the entire area
remains inaccessible...

15
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,760
This is where the tool
known as Brew,

16
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,262
or The Tempest, is located.

17
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:49,349
There are serious consequences

18
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:52,686
for anyone who stays
inside the field for too long...

19
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,564
Fortunately, this difficulty
applies to our enemies too.

20
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,276
The longest anybody may
safely remain within the

magnetic field is
twenty minutes...

22
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:03,863
Which means not only

23
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:05,448
will we be fighting
Arachnophobia

24
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:07,033
for possession of Brew...

25
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:10,370
We will be battling

[Marie] As you know,
our mission here

28
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,349
is to acquire
the Magic Tool Brew.

29
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:57,227
You were briefed on the
battle plan a few days ago...

30
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,853
Does everyone remember?

31
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,355
We do.

32
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,986
[Marie] While Sid's squad moves
to head off Arachnophobia,

33
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,531
we'll make for the center
of the island's magnetic field,

34
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,700
where Brew is lying dormant.

35
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,077
However, only Marie and I

36
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,746
will actually be
entering the field itself...

37
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,207
The rest of you are not to
set foot inside the field.

38
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,293
You will stay outside,
awaiting our return.

39

This may be the
biggest battle you've seen...

40
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:27,507
Remember, you were chosen
because you're the elite

41
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,592
among all one star meisters...

42
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,468
Fight well.

00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,345
Don't prove our choice wrong.

55
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:54,886
Looks like the explosion
completely leveled the place.

Keep your wits about you.

57
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,390
The magnetic field interferes

You stay here and see that

means a bigger battle.

situation was fairly obvious...

Certainly to a student at
the top of her class, anyway.

00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:43,586
[Maka]
Professor Stein's and

165
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,506
Miss Marie's
wavelengths just vanished.

166
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,466
You've been able to sense
their soul wavelengths,

167
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,052
even in a magnetic
field that strong?

168
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,095
The static is loud.

169
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:54,681
I only get a spark
here and there.

170
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:59,644
But I can tell
something isn't right.

171
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,939
Alright... then I'll go
in and check it out.

172
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,315
Since I'm a Grim Reaper,

173
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,901
my body shouldn't be
affected too much by the field.

174
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:07,902
No, Kid...

175
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:09,195
It isn't safe to go alone.

176
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,363
Come on.

177
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:11,948
In that case, we'll go too.

178
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,199
Yeah.

179
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,451
[Ox] What about the
professor's orders?

180
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,286
He was very explicit.

181
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,704
[Kim] I can't come,
or there won't

182
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:20,081
be anyone here
to send a signal.

183
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,890
[Ox] At any rate, it doesn't
look like we're alone anymore.

184
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,060
Perfect.

185
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,687
No worries.
We can take care of them.

186
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,105
You guys get
inside the field.

187
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,273
Leave them to us.

188
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,067
[Troops cry out]

189
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,028
[Ox] You want to challenge
the Royal Thunder?

190
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,199
Bad idea.

191
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:56,493
As you will no doubt realize...

192
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,126
You can't win.

193
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,963
I'll protect my
dear Kim at all costs...

194
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,841
Does my manly display
impress you, sweetheart?

195
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,053
I'd be more impressed if
you were rich and handsome.

196
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:18,264
Does nobody appreciate
my massive intellect?

197
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,105
You aren't getting past me
without paying the toll, boys.

198
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,073
I can't go in there and

199
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,575
leave my team behind
to fight these guys...

200
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,786
Tell ya what, Black Star...

201
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:42,914
Take this... for energy.

202
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,917
Candy bar...! A warm and
comforting treat in a bleak,

203
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,168
freezing cold wasteland!

204
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,087
[Kilik]
Just take it.

205
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,759
We'll be back.

206
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,555
[Kilik]
Now then...

207
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,979
Let's warm up this party.

208
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,190
Thunder!

209
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,195
Ready for Soul Resonance!

210
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:37,886
Aphex... Twin!

211
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,971
[explosion]

212
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,354
Let's go.

213
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,177
[Maka]
Man, you guys move fa--

214
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:25,350
What...? When we were
looking in from outside,

215
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:28,478
the building seemed to
be completely destroyed.

216
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,188
Now it's whole.

217
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,818
I still can't sense
the professor's soul...

218
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,653
...or Miss Marie's...

219
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:39,572
Maybe they went
inside the pyramid.

220
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,992
Hey...! Look up
there in the sky!

221
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,078
It looks like--!

222
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,081
That's impossible!

223
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:51,167
But he's always said
he can't leave the city!

224
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,511
[Maka]
It's Lord Death!

225
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,682
But... he doesn't
look right somehow.

226
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:06,933
That's how my dad
used to look back

227
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:10,020
before he started the academy.

228
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,480
Things were a
lot different then.

229
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,775
I still don't get
what's going on...

230
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,485
Why's he here?

231
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:21,531
Come on. We need to hurry

232
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,117
and see what's
happening over there.

233
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,760
Good luck little Mizune!

234
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,930
The DWMA
versus Arachnophobia...

235
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:48,850
Whoever wins,
we still come out on top.

236
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,754
I never knew being chased by

237
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:20,840
a samurai could
be this exciting?

238
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:34,938
[Mifune]
Damn zombie.

239
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,538
Did I miss him?

240
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,554
[Azusa]
What happened, Sid?

241
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:08,805
Are you okay?

242
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:11,141
Just a scratch, that's all.

243
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:12,851
I'll rest here for a bit,

244
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,478
then go and meet up with Naigus.

245
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,946
[Witch A]
Did you see that...?

246
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,698
It was the Grim Reaper.

247
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,367
[Witch B]
This place is done for.

248
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,077
[Witch C]
We need to flee.

249
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,500
It's a bunch of witches.

250
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,878
It doesn't seem like they
can see us here, though.

251
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,547
Take a closer look.

252
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,633
Their bodies are blurred.

253
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,177
It's just a hunch...

254
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,262
...but I think what we're
looking at is the past.

255
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:50,805
Maybe when the
explosion happened,

256
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:54,559
it sealed the events of that
day within the magnetic field...

257
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:57,937
And what we're seeing
is them played out again.

258
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,314
But I wonder...

259
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,482
...my dad showing up like

260
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,984
that and the
witches acting afraid...

261
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,903
Something feels off.

262
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:08,031
Was whatever happened
here really an accident?

263
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,047
What's wrong?
You see something?

264
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,049
That looked like--!

265
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:31,888
Yeah, no doubt about it.
That's Arachne.

266
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,307
[Guardian 1]
Lady Arachne...

267
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,643
Mosquito is waiting
for you at your carriage.

268
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:40,021
[Lady Arachne] And you
have Eibon's blueprints?

269
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,107
Yes... They're right here.

270
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,487
Eibon again!

271
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:54,994
[Lady Arachne laughs]

272
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:56,454
The first part's done.

273
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,665
We managed to
lure the Reaper here...

274
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,625
Now all we have to
do is blow up Brew

275
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,253
and this building
along with it.

276
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,467
What is going on here?

277
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,104
[Arachnid 5] The battle
for Brew continues.

278
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:23,106
The outcome is still uncertain.

279
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:25,567
We'll do whatever
we must to obtain it...

280
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,068
Among Eibon's creations,

281
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,113
Brew is the most important.

282
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:32,532
It is the acme
of his achievements...

283
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:36,161
It dwarfs any other Magic Tool.

284
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,912
Eight hundred years ago,

285
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,290
I designed a plan to
blow up Brew along with

286
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:42,917
the facility that held it
in order to prevent the Reaper

287
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,837
from ever learning
of the tool's existence.

288
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,714
But Brew is a masterpiece...

289
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:48,757
No one could hope to

290
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,383
destroy it with
a mere explosion.

291
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,927
It is far too powerful for that.

292
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,355
And now, after eight centuries,

293
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,690
Brew will not fall into
the hands of the witches.

294
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:09,736
Or the Grim Reaper
and his dear DWMA...

295
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:16,034
No... it will be mine.

[Lady Arachne] So, everybody,
what do you think...?

298
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:50,587
I realize you only got
a tiny peek at what

299
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,422
I was like eight
hundred years ago,

300
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:53,840
but that should be enough...

301
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:56,009
In those days,
I was busy setting traps,

302
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:59,471
killing witches, tricking Death,
making things explode...

303
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,765
Of course, I'm turning
over a new leaf now...

304
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:03,183
Perhaps I'll settle down

305
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,810
and open restaurant in a
quiet little village somewhere.

306

Who would believe that?
