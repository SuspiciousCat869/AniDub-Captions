1
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,478
A sound soul...

2
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,689
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:35,483
...and a sound body.

4
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,221
Tsubaki...!

5
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:06,473
Enchanted Sword Mode!

6
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:07,974
Right!

7
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:54,729
♪ opening song ♪

8
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,108
Uh, Kid...

9
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,778
What're we doing flying into the
middle of nowhere like this?

10
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:27,405
It's not like it was
my decision...

11
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,200
And I would really rather
not talk about it, okay?

12
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:32,577
Yeah, fine, but do you think
you could at least give us an

13
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,745
idea of where we're going?

14
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:34,537
Yeah...

15
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,082
that's fair enough.

16
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,584
We're going to a place
called Sarcophagus.

17
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:40,919
Sarcophagus?

18
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,045
That's right...

19
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,172
And it's aptly named, too.

20
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,383
And why's that?

21
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,969
It used to be just an ordinary
old village like any other.

22
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,013
But that was twenty years ago.

23
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:54,391
Things have changed.

24
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,017
Changed how?

25
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:57,310
Well...

26
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:58,478
One day...

27
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,106
It's citizens suddenly
disappeared...

28
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,192
Every last one of them.

29
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,527
What?

30
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,987
How could all those people
vanish into thin air?

31
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:10,240
To this day, no one knows.

32
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,200
The people sent to
investigate vanished,

33
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:15,870
just like the village's
citizens-- gone without a trace.

34
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,706
After awhile...

35
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,499
The investigation was given up.

36
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:21,751
It would have been
too dangerous to continue...

37
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,503
The entire area was locked down

38
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,839
to prevent further
disappearances...

39
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,175
That's where we're going.

40
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,724
There it is.

41
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,559
That's Sarcophagus.

42
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:47,068
The Last Magic Toolo~ Mission
Impossible for Unarmed Kid?

43
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,238
See that?

44
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:53,158
That wall was hastily built...

45
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,909
Almost like the builders
were desperately

46
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:58,329
trying to cover something
up before anyone saw it.

47
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,624
Like the academy's doing now.

48
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,376
This place is givin'
me the creeps.

49
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,087
Maybe we should forget
the mission, huh?.

50
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,255
I hope we see a monster!

51
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:10,508
Don't say stuff like that!
Are you crazy?!

52
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:17,307
No, no, no!
Not happening.

53
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,558
I am not going in there.

54
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,477
You know I can't deal
with creepy stuff...!

55
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,895
I've even got a
doctor's note that

56
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,980
specifically says
to avoid monsters.

57
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,274
You want to see it?
I'll show it to you!

58
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:27,650
You can calm down...

59
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,737
I'm not taking the
two of you with me.

60
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:32,697
Seriously?

61
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,033
We don't know what caused
the disappearances...

62
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:36,284
It could be a monster...

63
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:37,619
...or a virus...

64
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:40,330
...or maybe even some kind
of chemical weapon...

65
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,999
...but one thing we
do know for sure...

66
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,751
...no human who's
ever gone in there

67
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,253
has made it back out alive.

68
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,964
I can't risk taking you
guys in there with me...

69
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,551
...not when I have no idea
what we'd be up against...

70
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:56,304
It would simply
be too dangerous.

71
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,849
Much as I hate to admit it,
you've got a point there.

72
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,227
I'm guessing that's why
Dad sent me instead

73
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,895
of one of the other meisters.

74
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:07,273
My Reaper body is less
vulnerable than most.

75
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,693
Even so, this is
still dangerous.

76
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,487
Yes, but what
does that matter...?

77
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,031
My dad has made his
policies on this clear...

78
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,701
Our top priority
is the Magic Tools.

79
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:19,744
That's what you're after here?

80
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:23,623
If I'm not out in forty minutes,
head back for the academy.

81
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:25,500
Go straight there...

82
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,169
You will not come in after me.

83
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,007
Instead of sending me out
to help battle the Kishin,

84
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,134
Dad gives me this mission...

85
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,635
Well, soon enough
I'll see what's

86
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,138
so important about this Tool.

87
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,642
We've lost contact with
the thirteenth squadron...

88
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,686
Fifteen and seventeen:
circle around and

89
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,814
attack the enemy in
area thirty-four!

90
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:51,192
It sounds like it's
complete chaos out there.

91
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,820
All in all, I'd say it
could be going better.

92
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:56,448
Maybe it's time for us to
assume the command.

93
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:58,116
And what're we supposed to say?

94
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,326
What orders do we
give that'll help them?

95
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,328
I don't know, but anything
would be better than

96
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,247
standing here doing
nothing while they fight.

97
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,540
That's where you've
got it wrong.

98
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,417
If we start giving
random orders,

99
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,086
we could stir up even
more confusion.

100
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:16,217
No, not the scary face again.

101
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,886
Listen to you two...

102
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,430
Sometimes I envy your freedom.

103
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,724
You can go wherever you want,

104
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,143
do whatever you want,
whenever you want...

105
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:26,728
You can take real action.

106
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,355
You aren't chained here.

107
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:30,774
Know what I mean?

108
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,904
He's got a point.
At least we can leave.

109
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:39,407
I guess we're not the only
ones who're frustrated.

110
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,826
If his soul wasn't
bound to Death City,

111
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,244
Lord Death would
have been the first

112
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:46,373
one on that battlefield
fighting the Kishin.

113
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:56,132
Here we are...
The vanishing village.

114
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,237
So far I don't sense
anything abnormal about

115
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,614
this place other than
its emptiness...

116
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,117
It's utterly silent.

117
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,204
But still, there has
to be something here.

118
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,255
What's that?

119
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,064
Where the hell am I?

120
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:58,319
This looks like the inside
of some sort of ancient ruin.

121
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,280
Hey...!

122
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:02,198
Hey, boss man!

123
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:06,161
I'm not your boss man...
Please, just call me Joe.

124
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:08,997
Boss, come here...!

125
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,498
We've got lunch all ready.

126
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,167
It's time to eat!

127
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,794
I don't care what you say,
I'm still not your boss.

128
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,254
Mister Boss Man...

129
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,798
There's coffee down
here for you, too!

130
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:22,469
Boss or not, I can
still have a cup of coffee.

131
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,890
The coffee?

132
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,641
Here...
Have some!

133
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:31,436
Yum-my, yum-my coffee!

134
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:37,192
This is the coffee?

135
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,449
This is the tool?

136
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,871
Looks like a key.

137
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,586
The biggest key
that I've ever seen.

138
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,046
This seems too easy...

139
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:01,257
I just waltz into a deserted
city, grab the Magic Tool,

140
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:03,510
and walk back out again?

141
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,178
Maybe it's a fake...

142
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,888
If so, it's a good one...

143
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:10,100
It looks authentic
enough to me, anyway.

144
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,751
Hold on...!

145
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,378
Slow down...!

146
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,005
Maka!

147
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:41,756
Do you hear me...?

148
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,675
Stop running!

149
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,763
I know you want to move fast...

150
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,016
But where are you going?

151
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,148
I don't know.

152
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,867
Nice one.

153
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,411
Probably should have figured out
where we were going first...

154
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:13,705
I know you want to
find Medusa and Crona...

155
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,874
...but you won't do it
running around blindly.

156
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,042
You are familiar with the whole

157
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,710
'look before you
leap' thing, right?

158
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,129
Yeah...
I know you're right...

159
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,088
Sorry.

160
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,842
So...
what do you wanna do now?

161
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:26,926
Well...

162
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,970
I can try using my
soul perception...

163
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,264
...that should sniff out Medusa.

164
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:34,851
That won't do any good if
she has her Soul Protect on.

165
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,729
True, but there's still
Professor Stein...

166
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,356
...and Crona and
Miss Marie are out

167
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:41,149
there hunting the witch too...

168
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:45,028
If I can find any of their
souls, they'll lead me to her.

169
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:45,945
Lovely.

170
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,322
So now we've got
Professor Stein,

171
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:48,907
who even Lord Death
couldn't locate...

172
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,618
...and then there's Miss Marie
and Crona, who went after him...

173
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:53,661
We're trying to find three
people who could be anywhere in

174
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,914
the world and we don't have a
clue where to start looking...

175
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,249
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's
going to work out perfectly.

176
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:02,420
Don't be so negative, Soul.
I know it's going to work.

177
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:08,134
Of course...
I'll still need your help.

178
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,512
Uh...
sure thing.

179
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:17,977
Damn it!

180
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:25,318
I guess this is the security
system guarding the tool.

181
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,197
Are you qualified?

182
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,244
Do you have what it takes
to wield the Magic Tool?

183
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:35,954
Creepy clown...

184
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,414
Who are you?

185
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,165
What are you doing here...?

186
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,418
Were you the one
who destroyed the village?

187
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:42,919
Answer me!

188
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,763
What am I doing here?

189
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:56,516
I prevent meddlesome humans
from entering this place...

190
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,351
...or from leaving
it alive, at least.

191
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:01,062
I destroy anyone who
touches the Magic Tool.

192
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:05,066
You're responsible for what
happened twenty years ago!

193
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,443
That is correct...

194
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:09,529
I protect the resting place
of the last Magic Tool.

195
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:12,198
You killed them all
because of the tool?

196
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,576
Those foolish humans...

197
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,120
They dug up this ruin
twenty years ago

198
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,581
and discovered the tool...

199
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:22,667
They weren't qualified
to wield it either...

200
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:25,295
So I ate them...

201
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:28,298
I ate them all.

202
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,592
They were delicious.

203
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,971
All trespassers must die...

204
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,057
That includes you, too.

205
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,101
Snack time!

206
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,898
You won't make a
meal of me that easily.

207
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,232
Running, are you...?

208
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,818
I won't let you get far.

209
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,412
With a huge body like that,

210
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,790
he'll never be able to
squeeze in after me.

211
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,918
What a poorly designed
security system.

212
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,675
Aw, are you stuck?

213
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,891
Not good!

214
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,484
Close one.

215
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,819
But I did it.

216
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,613
Now I just have to make
it back to Liz and Patty.

217
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:36,533
What's that?!

218
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:41,413
There're two?!
Didn't see that coming.

219
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,046
Chow time.

220
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,969
Oink! Oink! Oink...!
Oink! Oink! Oink!

221
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,471
Kid sure is taking
his time, huh?

222
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,682
There's no reason to worry.
It might take a while,

223
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,018
but I'm sure everything'll
be hunky-dory...

224
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,395
If anyone can do it,
it's our meister.

225
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:06,938
Do it, Kid!
I believe in you!

226
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,314
But just to be safe...

227
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:10,942
...maybe we should go in
there and check up on him.

228
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,695
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What,
are you kidding me?!

229
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,947
We'd be nuts to go into
someplace as creepy as that!

230
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,699
Do you have a death
wish or something?!

231
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,242
It'll be fine.

232
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,411
I say we go in after him.

233
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:22,829
Seriously...?

234
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:27,751
Were you listening
to a thing I just said?

235
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:28,918
Of course I was...

236
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:31,421
You said something
about a pig, right?

237
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:32,172
Don't...

238
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:32,922
...you...
...ever...

239
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,633
Listen when I talk?!

240
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,095
What's that?

241
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,514
What's what?

242
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:42,307
I don't know what
you're talking about.

243
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,433
I didn't hear anything.

244
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:45,060
Nothing at all!

245
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,238
Still coming.

246
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:02,494
Perfect symmetry!

247
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,455
No symmetry!

248
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,124
Perfect symmetry!

249
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,127
Not symmetrical at all.
Now perfectly symmetrical.

250
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,630
Now not symmetrical at all.

251
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,049
What a perfect pose!

252
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,842
Unbelievable beauty...

253
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,011
The very definition
of symmetry...

254
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,182
Oh dear.

255
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,187
Oh, the destructive
power of true beauty!

256
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,158
A little further.
Just to that building.

257
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,457
Give it back...

258
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,252
Hand over the Magic Tool now!

259
00:16:56,006 --> 00:17:06,182
Hiya Kid, how are ya?

260
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,768
We just came to check on you!

261
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,729
You came after me?

262
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:11,813
Sure...

263
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,732
...what else would we do?

264
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,029
Not so scared of
creepy monsters anymore?

265
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,245
Now, Patty!

266
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,121
Okay...!

267
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:29,622
On it!

268
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:41,051
You had no right
to destroy this village...

269
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:42,886
You're going to pay for that.

270
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:45,305
Are you ready
for your punishment?

271
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:54,773
Hand it over.
Hand it over.

272
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,733
Hand it over NOW!!

273
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,361
These guys aren't easy.

274
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:03,031
This is bad, Kid.
Our shots won't go through.

275
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,702
What now?

276
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:25,387
Resonance stable.
Noise: two point seven percent.

277
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,390
Black needles are fully
charged with soul wavelength.

278
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,724
Feedback ready...

279
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,101
In five seconds.

280
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:32,102
Four.

281
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,186
Three.

282
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:34,145
Two.

283
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,313
One.

284
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,773
Ready to fire.

285
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,274
Symmetry...

286
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:41,236
At least your end
will be beautiful.

287
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:51,162
Death Cannon!

288
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,051
Mission accomplished.

289
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:18,064
Unable to activate
auto-recovery...

290
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,441
System down...

291
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,775
Not responding...

292
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,446
Estimated damage received:
ninety-two percent...

293
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,574
Activation time remaining:
three minutes.

294
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:30,160
It moved...?! What now?

295
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,582
You who defeated
this guardian...

296
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,292
Hear me now.

297
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,837
It's different from
the voice before...

298
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,255
What's going on?

299
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,090
This is a warning.

300
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:45,508
Before you proceed...

301
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,344
Make certain you have
the will to use

302
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,263
the Magic Tool you now possess.

303
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,725
For those who
are not qualified...

304
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,769
...there will be no glory...

305
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,563
Only destruction awaits.

306
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,072
Maybe he's right.

307
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:12,285
How can we know for certain
that the course we follow is

308
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,788
better than the one our
enemies have chosen...?

309
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,499
Who can promise that the
academy will never use

310
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,377
the Magic Tools
with evil intent?

311
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,191
So that's it...?

312
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,235
The thing we
were sent here to find?

313
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:46,569
Yes...

314
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:48,154
And given the level of
security set up around it,

315
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:51,324
I'd say my dad's not the only
one who thinks it's important.

316
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:52,409
Kay...

317
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,911
...so what's he
planning to use it for?

318
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,621
That I don't know yet.

319
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:59,290
If I did know...

320
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,501
...things would be much simpler.

321
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,797
What that robot thing said...

322
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,049
...is it still bothering you?

323
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,301
Yeah, it is.

324
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:11,553
Because of that...

325
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,471
I'm not sure if
handing this over to

326
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,474
my dad is the right
thing to do.

327
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,059
This is a warning.

328
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,395
For those who
are not qualified...

329
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,313
...there will be no glory...

330
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,233
Only destruction awaits.

331
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,661
Ya-hoo!

332
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:40,665
Well then.

333
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,335
Looks like it's just you and me.

334
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:06,358
♪ closing music ♪

335
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,611
Despite the dangers
that lie ahead,

336
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,405
they continue on their path...

337
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:37,699
The woman who would
recover her lost partner...

338
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,118
...and the boy who would
confront his devious mother...

339
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:43,329
A mismatched pair struggling
toward an unknown fate...

340
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,373
What will await them at the
end of their journey...?

341
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,499
Will they find hope?

342
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,084
Or only more despair...?

343
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:50,211
Hey, who is that?

344
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,671
It's Patty, silly!

345
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:53,757
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

346
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,592
Weakling Crona's
Determination...

347
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,136
For You, For Always
Being By My Side?

348
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,221
Patty's here!
