00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,458
How do you feel
about Mama? Be honest.

165
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,666
[Death Scythe]
Don't show any hesitation.

166
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,541
That's easy.
I love her, of course.

167
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,083
Then how come you cheated
on her all the time?

168
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,416
[Death Scythe thinks] That was
way too much hesitation!

169
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,666
Now no matter what I say,
it won't sound convincing.

170
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,416
I'm in big trouble!

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,666
Hang in there...

172
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,875
Millions of men everywhere
are on your side.

173
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,250
Don't run away from this...

174
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,375
Stand and face your
daughter like a man...

175
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,958
Don't run, don't run,
don't run... don't run!

176
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,750
It's getting chilly,
don't you think...?

177
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,291
Maybe we should
head inside, huh?

178
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,375
Already...?

179
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,791
But we just got here.

180
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,750
[Death Scythe thinks]
I didn't run away quick enough!

181
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,083
All these pointed questions...

182
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,666
She's starting to take
after her mother.

183
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,666
Listen, Maka...

184
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,958
Papa loves you and Mama

185
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,666
more than anything
in the world...

186
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,375
...and that's the truth.

187
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,625
It's the truth...

188
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,916
It... is... the truth.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,375
I swear it's the truth, Maka!

190
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,375
[Kid]
This is it.

191
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,458
[Black Star]
Yahoo!

192
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,666
Excalibur's up there
waiting for me.

193
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,083
Yes... According to this,
we'll have to climb up

194
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,791
there and find the
cave the sword is in.

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,791
[Black Star]
Hey...! No fair...!

196
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,125
Damn it...
Spoiled rich kids

197
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,916
have all the
best toys, don't they?

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,166
You're not
leaving me behind!

199
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,083
[Black Star starts
a rallying cry]

200
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:45,875
Kid's not here.

201
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,416
Where'd he go?

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
In there maybe?

203
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,416
[Kid]
Black Star...

204
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,750
I can't come down.

205
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,041
There's water... My pants
are going to get wet.

206
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,666
[Black Star] What are
you talking about?

207
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,541
You carry me.

208
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,666
Yeah, right...

209
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,125
You can stay there.

210
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,791
Such a terrible obstacle
so early in the quest...

211
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,250
Our chosen path...

212
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,083
is truly a cruel one.

213
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,708
Yeah, you've really got it
rough here, don't you?

214
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,208
I'll ward off the
water from above,

215
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,791
and you can handle the
water on the ground, okay...?

216
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,000
We'll work together.

217
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,041
It's a good thing there
are two of us here.

218
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,250
This way would
be impassible alone.

219
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,583
Quite an obstacle!

220
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,833
Dude, you're kind of a
useless idiot, aren't you?

221
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,500
Aah!

222
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,041
It looks like a fairy...

223
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,875
What's something like
that doing here?

224
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,916
We're hunting after
a legendary sword...

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,916
Finding a fairy or two
shouldn't be surprising...

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,083
Is Excalibur up ahead?

227
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,833
Are we in the right place?

228
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,833
She's not a very
polite fairy, is she?

229
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,791
Looks like the
path dead-ends here.

230
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,083
Hey... over there.

231
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
Yes... no doubt about it...

232
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,583
That's it...

233
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,125
The Holy Sword Excalibur.

234
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,041
Awesome!

235
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,208
The air here is vibrating.

236
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,500
Standing here I can easily
believe what the book says

237
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,791
about becoming a hero

238
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,583
and earning everlasting
fame and glory.

239
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,458
This cave certainly seems
like a magical place.

240
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,250
Just look at the sword.

241
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,125
Such precise, detailed
ornamentation on the hilt...

242
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,083
and not a single
nick on the blade.

243
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,375
This is indeed deserving
of the title "Holy Sword."

244
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,625
A magnificent sword,

245
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,500
which can only be pulled
out by the chosen hero.

246
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,375
By... me...

247
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,875
Yay! Looks like I'm a hero!
A big, big hero! Yahoo!

248
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,166
[Kid] This is some
kind of mistake...

249
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,708
I hate to break it to you,
but you're no hero.

250
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,083
How about a do-over?

251
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,833
Huh? You saying that
didn't count or something...?

252
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,125
Fine, but I'm sure it's just
gonna be the same every time.

253
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,958
No, this time I'm
going to do it.

254
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,333
Yeah right. You wish...

255
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,333
The sword chose me
to be its hero, Kid...

256
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,291
I'm a big, fat hero!

257
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,208
Best to be safe.

258
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,583
Who knows who else has touched
this sword over the years?

259
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,458
Hurry up and do it.

260
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,333
It came out!

261
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,541
Huh?! How come you
were able to get it out, too?

262
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,833
It must be because
I loosened it.

263
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:25,916
[Excalibur]
Welcome...

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,625
Welcome to my cave,
young ones.

265
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,333
It's talking!

266
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,625
[Excalibur] Please forgive the
belated salutations...

267
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,166
I am the Holy Sword...

268
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,041
...Excalibur!

269
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,625
How... incredibly...

270
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,083
...lame.

271
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,583
[Death Scythe makes childish
gibberish sounds]

272
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,250
Papa... Would you tell me
more about the Demon Sword...

273
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,708
...Ragnarok?

274
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,500
Long ago...

275
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,125
...meisters and weapons
worked together under

276
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,000
Lord Death to maintain
peace and order in the world,

277
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,708
the same function for
which you are being trained.

278
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,750
No meister and weapon
pair was allowed to

279
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,458
collect the soul of a
human being for

280
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,208
any reason whatsoever.

281
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,833
That rule still stands...

282
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,125
and now it seems as
natural to us as breathing.

283
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,958
Because while a human
soul increases a weapon's

284
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,291
ability and power just
as a Kishin soul does,

285
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,875
the price is steep...

286
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,125
A weapon that takes a
human soul will pay by

287
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,166
losing his or her
own human heart.

288
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,250
[Death Scythe continues]
Despite the risk, however...

289
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,375
...there were meisters who
broke that sacred rule.

290
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,875
These meisters feared
death above all else...

291
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,125
Their constant battles
left them frightened...

292
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:16,250
broken... and they took to
hunting human souls.

293
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,500
Again and again,

294
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,916
they defied the rule,
secretly feeding their

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,958
weapons the souls
of innocent humans.

296
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,125
As a result...

297
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,416
...a Kishin was born
into this world.

298
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,083
[Death Scythe] Death Weapon
Meister Academy was founded in

299
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,833
order to recover souls who
have left the human path and

300
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,708
become eggs of Kishin...

301
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,333
It was also created to
train and oversee meisters

302
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,000
and weapons who are
too young to hunt down evil

303
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,750
without someone to guide them.

304
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,125
The ultimate goal is to
prevent the Kishin from

305
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,500
ever being reborn and

306
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,833
once again raining terror
down upon the world.

307
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,625
[Maka]
So... the Demon Sword...

308
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,416
[Death Scythe] Yes...
It devours human souls...

309
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,666
It was melted down by a
witch and implanted in

310
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,583
the body of a
meister as black blood.

311
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,875
Now... The Demon Sword...

312
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,750
...Ragnarok is only one step
away from becoming a Kishin.

313
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,000
And it's not just the

314
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,041
sword we have
to worry about...

315
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,041
There are people who
could become Kishin as well.

316
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,125
And beyond that...

317
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,291
There's Soul...

318
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,375
...whose body now
contains black blood.

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,375
Let's see...

320
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,916
Are you still hard at work
like a good boy, Black Star?

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,958
Ooh! See what you

322
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,750
can do if you
put your mind to it!

323
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,458
(oh) Hi, Professor Sid...

324
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,750
After I put this book away,
I'll be all done.

325
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,500
Tsubaki?! So, that sneaky
little brat dumped his

326
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,375
punishment on her
and took off, did he?

327
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,750
Back when I was still alive,

328
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,791
I hated it when dirty tricks
like this were pulled!

329
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,041
[Tsubaki] It's okay Professor,
don't worry about it...

330
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,333
I enjoy cleaning.

331
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,583
If you're looking
for Black Star,

332
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,750
he's not here.

333
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,375
He and Kid went to
find the Holy Sword...

334
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,458
Why has he done
something wrong?

335
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,583
[Sid]
The... Holy Sword.

336
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,125
Yes... Excalibur.

337
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,666
The same sword...
that tears the air...

338
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,708
...and shakes the very ground?

339
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,875
Let's stop talking about it.

340
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,250
Yeah... in some way,

341
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,000
this is the ultimate
remedial lesson.

342
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,708
I'll let this one slide...

343
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,916
That's the kind of man I was.

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,208
Okay... I've got a bunch of
tests that need grading.

345
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,458
[Tsubaki]
Huh?

346
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,000
[Black Star]
You're the Holy Sword...?

347
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,375
In the top hat?!

348
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,583
Seriously?!
[Kid snickers]

349
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,958
[Excalibur] You're one to talk,
in that funny outfit...!

350
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,291
Who are you, exactly?

351
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,166
Who am I...?

352
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,625
I'm Black Star, the bi--

353
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,958
[Excalibur] My legend dates back
to the twelfth century,

354
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,208
thank you very much...

355
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,083
From the looks of you,
you must be meisters...

356
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,583
Where are you children from?

357
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,416
Who do you think you are,
pointing that thing at me...?

358
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,666
Put it down freak.

359
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,250
We're from Death Weapon Meis--

360
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,666
[Excalibur] I know that. Here,
I want to show you something.

361
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,083
Then why did you ask if
you already knew the answer?

362
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,583
[Black Star]
What's with this guy...?

363
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,750
And why the hell isn't
he wearing any pants?

364
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,333
What's he showing us, I wonder.

365
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,416
[Excalibur] Young ones, do you
want to hear the legend of me?

366
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,708
[Black Star]
Put that thing away!

367
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,291
[Excalibur] Do you want to
hear a heroic tale?

368
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,208
Get that out of my face!

369
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,583
[Excalibur] Where have you
traveled here from?

370
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,583
[Black Star]
Like we said!

371
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,958
We're from
Death Weapon Meister--

372
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:06,791
[Excalibur] What is
your favorite number

373
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,875
between 1 and 12?

374
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,666
[Black Star]
What...?

375
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,583
Between 1 and 12?

376
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,208
One, obviously, cuz I refuse to
back down until I'm number one.

377
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,333
And mine is eight...

378
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,083
...because of its
perfect symmetry.

379
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,625
[Excalibur] Fools...! What right
do you have to choose a number?

380
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,166
My legend dates all the
way back to the twelfth century,

381
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,541
you know.

382
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,500
You asked us to pick a
favorite number, so we did!

383
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,000
[Excalibur] Do you want to
hear my legend or not?

384
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,166
Just quit with the
cane already, will ya?

385
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,375
[Excalibur]
As I said...

386
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,625
...my legend begins
in the twelfth century.

387
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,666
My mornings begin
with a cup of coffee

388
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,833
with cream at the café.

389
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,833
My afternoons begin
with a cup of hot tea

390
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,791
with two lumps of sugar.

391
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,666
And my evenings--

392
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,500
Let me guess, booze...?

393
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,291
Sounds right for
an old guy like you.

394
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,500
[Excalibur]
Fool!

395
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,041
In the evening,
I change into my pajamas.

396
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,666
Why do we
care about that?

397
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,416
That's all irrelevant
to the legend...

398
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,833
Besides, pajamas---

399
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,291
[Excalibur] Fools...! Do you
know what this hat is?

400
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,125
Huh?

401
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,125
[Excalibur]
I asked...

402
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,458
...do you know
what this hat is?

403
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,833
How should we know that?

404
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,125
It appears to be
made of silk,

405
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,291
if that's what you mean.

406
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,750
[Excalibur]
Fools...! If you don't know,

407
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,250
I guess I'll have to tell you...

408
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,125
The taller the chef's hat,
the greater the chef.

409
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,166
Okay, so what you're

410
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,458
trying to tell
us then is you're--

411
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,625
[Excalibur] Fool!
Who said that I was a chef ?

412
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,041
Dude, nothing you're
saying makes any sense!

413
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,375
[Excalibur] This is why
I can't abide hayseeds.

414
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,791
AHHHH!

415
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,541
You are beyond annoying!

416
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,875
Black Star calm down...

417
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,958
Don't let this guy and
his nonsense get to you.

418
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,958
'Holy Sword',
you gotta be kidding me!

419
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:31,875
Let me see that book!

420
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,583
It's completely unreliable!

421
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,458
Who wrote this...?

422
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,125
Let's see... the author is...

423
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,333
Eee...eks, cal,

424
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,583
ee...mmm....bur?

425
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,791
[Kid]
Excalibur.

426
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,791
It was you?!

427
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,666
[Excalibur]
No autographs.

428
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,625
Professor...?

429
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,125
I have a question.

430
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,916
What kind of weapon
is the Holy Sword?

431
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,791
Oh...that, huh?

432
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,791
Whoever draws the sword

433
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,333
is said to be
made a great king,

434
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,666
given wings of light,

435
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,833
and granted the ability
to soar through the sky...

436
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,750
The sword can cut through
space with a single swing...

437
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,958
Without a doubt;

438
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,666
it is the most powerful
weapon in the world.

439
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,625
I see... but only a hero
who's been chosen can

440
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,458
match soul wavelengths
with it, right?

441
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,333
No... that's not true,
unfortunately.

442
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,458
[Stein]
Surprisingly enough,

443
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,791
Excalibur can
match with anyone.

444
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,875
[Excalibur] Before becoming
my meister, there is a list of a

445
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,416
thousand provisions
you must peruse.

446
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,708
Be sure to look
through all of them.

447
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,333
They're important.

448
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,583
Even the backs of these
pages have been written on.

449
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,916
[Excalibur] I greatly look
forward to your participation in

450
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,583
number four-hundred-and
fifty-two...

451
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,916
the five hour
storytelling party.

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,375
And thus...

453
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,291
Thus, you have
been chosen.

454
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,166
It shall all be yours...!

455
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,500
Victory... and glory!

456
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,708
Victory!

457
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,375
Glory!

458
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:54,375
[Excalibur]
Now, let's go! Together!

459
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,250
Yeah, right...who'd ever
want a sword like you?

460
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,500
Useless piece of metal.

461
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,791
Anybody can match their

462
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,500
soul wavelength with
the sword just fine,

463
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,125
but there's no one in
the world who can ever

464
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,875
match personal wavelengths
with Excalibur.

465
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,583
[Excalibur] Hey...
Hold on...! Come back!

466
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,625
I'll tell you what...

467
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,833
I can lower those one thousand

468
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,083
provisions down
to eight hundred.

469
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,208
Just as long as you

470
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,375
take part in the
story telling party!

471
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,625
[Black Star] Anyone who can put
up with him is a hero.

472
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,083
[Kid]
Disgusting!

473
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,583
Oh hi!

474
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,416
Did you meet the
Holy Sword Excalibur?

475
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,541
[Fairy]
Yeah, they met him.

476
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:43,625
[bells toll]

477
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,250
[Black Star] We've both got
fine partners already, huh?

478
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,250
[Kid]
Mm hmm.

479
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,500
[Liz and Patty]
Hmm?

480
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,083
[Soul] All right...! It looks
like the gang is all here.

481
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,375
[All]
Hey Soul!

I'm starting to get the
strange feeling that

489
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,458
other people have
been laughing at us.

What is that thing?
