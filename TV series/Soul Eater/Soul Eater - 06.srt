00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,166
[Soul thinks] This guy
was strong enough

164
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
to bring down Anubis.

165
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,291
[Black Star thinks]
He's gotta have guts

166
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,916
to try and outshine
me all the time.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
[Kid thinks] These two punks
may not be perfect...

168
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,208
...but they did manage to

169
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,375
defeat Sid and hold off
Dr. Stein's attacks.

170
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,750
I'll need to keep my guard up.

171
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,375
Let's go.

172
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,458
[gunfire]

173
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,083
Hey what...?

174
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,125
[Student 1]
Dr. Stein...

175
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,541
It's Soul and Black Star...

176
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,458
They're fighting
someone outside.

177
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,916
[Stein] Hmm?

178
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,416
[Maka] Soul, that idiot...
What is it now?

179
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,208
Excuse me Dr. Stein ...

180
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,625
There's a rule
about two meisters

181
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,000
dueling on campus...

182
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,041
It states that, in order for
the duel to continue,

183
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,250
there must be a professor
there to witness it.

184
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,291
I hate to stop here,
but it can't be helped.

185
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,041
[Cuckoo nervously cries out]

186
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,833
We'll have to
postpone the dissection.

187
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,500
As Soul and
Black Star's partners,

188
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,916
Maka and Tsubaki,
come along with me.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,166
Everyone else study something.

190
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,875
We can't even get
close to the guy.

191
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,375
What was that...?

192
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,125
You're looking for a more up
close and personal fight...?

193
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,125
Fine by me.

194
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,416
[Black Star thinks]
We'll see.

195
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,125
[Soul cries out as he attacks]

196
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,083
Damn it!

197
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,416
What the hell?

198
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,083
[gun fires]

199
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,166
[gun fires]

200
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,875
Oh man, that hurt
really, really bad!

201
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,750
Did you think a pair of
normal pistols would be

202
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,083
enough for a Grim Reaper?

203
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,458
We aren't like regular
guns that shoot bullets...

204
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,791
We shoot compressed wavelengths
of our meister's soul...

205
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,291
[Soul thinks]
Damn it.

206
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,208
[Black Star thinks]
How dare he go easy on us?

207
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,625
[Stein]
Oh, my...

208
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,500
They probably should have
picked a different opponent.

209
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,458
Dr. Stein, is that the boy...?

210
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,500
The one with the guns.

211
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,666
Is he the new
kid that everyone's

212
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,208
been talking about so much?

213
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,291
Yep...
That's Lord Death's son...

214
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,541
Death the Kid...

215
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,250
It was his own decision
to attend the academy...

216
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,916
But he won't be
a normal student...

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,833
His abilities are far greater
than anyone else's here.

218
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,125
[Tsubaki thinks]
But why Black Star?

219
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,500
Sorry, Tsubaki...

220
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,666
We're switching out...

221
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,416
I'm gonna be Soul's
meister from now on.

222
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
[Maka]
Tsubaki...?

223
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,500
Is something wrong?

224
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh no, it's nothing.

225
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,000
[Stein] My dear soul-seeing
Scythe Meister Maka,

226
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,000
can I borrow you for a moment?

227
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,541
Uh, yeah...?

228
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,375
[Stein] I have a special lesson
in mind for you today.

229
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,833
[Maka]
Oh... okay.

230
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,875
[Stein] Now, now... there's
no reason to be worried...

231
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a very simple question.

232
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,333
Take a look at the duel.

233
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,875
Watch Kid and his
twin pistols as they fight...

234
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,666
I want you to
pay particular attention

235
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,875
to their souls' wavelengths.

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,541
[Maka] Normally
it's almost impossible

237
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,083
to sync the wavelengths
of two weapons like that...

238
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,291
But the connection between

239
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,291
all three of them is
strong and very stable.

240
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,083
[Maka] And the weapons seem
to share a respect for him...

241
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,083
No, that's not the word.

242
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,875
Admiration... is that it?

243
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,375
Exactly correct...
a good observation...

244
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,458
The twin pistols are
called the Thompson sisters.

245
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,083
They grew up on the streets...

246
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,333
Their lives were much
harder before they met Kid...

247
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,333
It's natural they would have
a strong admiration for him.

248
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,708
[Stein] The partnership
works for Kid, too.

249
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,208
It's good for him to
be around people so different...

250
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,708
The Thompson sisters' laid-back

251
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,250
attitudes have
a positive influence

252
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,833
on him by quieting
his neurotic tendencies.

253
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,666
They do make a really
good team, those three.

254
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,291
Don't they?

255
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,500
You can't even compare
'em to our two idiots out there.

256
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,041
Let's hurry up and
finish this guy off.

257
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,041
It's about time.

258
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,375
[Kid]
For what?

259
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,416
You should quake with fear
of your impending death!

260
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,791
When you say that,
it just makes me want to laugh.

261
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,125
You won't be laughing when

262
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,833
you taste our
"Power of Friendship."

263
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,958
That's right...

264
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,166
It's incredible...

265
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,000
The power is beyond belief.

266
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,458
What?

267
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,833
Let's do it.

268
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,291
Yeah.

269
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,125
[Soul]
Transform!

270
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,791
Whoa!

271
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,416
That's so cool!

272
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,791
I don't think they're
taking this very seriously.

273
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,250
Come on, Soul!

274
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,291
[Soul]
Friendship!

275
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,541
[Black Star]
Fusion!

276
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,583
[split]

277
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,458
[Soul] Why the hell did you
catch me with your head, moron!?

278
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,333
Ah! I don't know!

279
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,916
[Soul]
Do it right this time.

280
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,250
You're too freaking heavy...!

281
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,291
I can't pick you up.

282
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,625
[Soul]
I'm not heavy.

283
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,083
Maka swings me around
without breaking a sweat.

284
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,791
Black Star and Soul
are definitely

285
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,375
lacking in the compatible
wavelength department.

286
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,833
So it seems.

287
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,958
[Black Star]
Come on, you stupid scythe...!

288
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:16,791
I just need to lift you up.

289
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,041
What the hell are you

290
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,166
doing hitting me with
your soul's wavelength?

291
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,250
That hurt, you idiot!

292
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,333
[Black Star]
Oh... my bad.

293
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,750
It's almost hard to
watch... Those morons can't

294
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,125
seem to sense each other's
wavelengths at all.

295
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,791
Before a meister and his or
her weapon fight an opponent,

296
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,791
they need to adjust their
wavelengths to each other.

297
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,708
[Soul] Black Star...
It's over between us.

298
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,541
Wh-What exactly are
you saying, Soul?

299
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,625
[Soul] If we try to stay
together like this...

300
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,958
I'll only end up hating
you... It's for the best.

301
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,041
[Maka and Tsubaki]
Huh?

302
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,250
[Stein]
Huh?

303
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,500
[Kid] Hey...
can I shoot them now?

304
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,291
[Liz] Let's wait. Things are
just starting to get good.

305
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,041
Oh... I understand...

306
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,125
but even though it's over...

307
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,166
Would it be okay...

308
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,541
...if we stay friends?

309
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,291
[Soul]
You idiot...!

310
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,166
Of course we're still
going to be friends. Forever!

311
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,250
Oh Soul!

312
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,250
Black Star!

313
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,291
Oh Soul!

314
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,166
Black Star!

315
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,958
Oh Soul!

316
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,833
They need professional help.

317
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,125
[gunfire]

318
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,208
[Kid]
Oops. Sorry.

319
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,208
My fingers slipped.

320
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,500
We can't just quit in
the middle of a fight.

321
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,500
Right...! We're not giving
up 'til we beat him.

322
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,666
Kay... We'll see how
well that works.

323
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,375
[Soul and Black Star
bellow as they attack]

324
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,708
[Black Star] Let's see how you
handle a taste of my soul waves.

325
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,125
[Maka] Black Star's
specialty is martial arts...

326
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,750
...but Kid is just
playing with him.

327
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,166
And the way he's
been fighting today,

328
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,833
Soul has no chance
against him either.

329
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,083
[Kid] You're as low
as you are stupid.

330
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,125
You're going down!

331
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,291
You idiot, you fell for it.

332
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,291
Hah...! Gotcha!

333
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,041
[Black Star weakly]
Okay...

334
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,875
Now I really
wanna kill that guy.

335
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,541
Our partners are
pretty useless, huh?

336
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,666
And now it's time...

337
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,958
...to see the power
of a Grim Reaper.

338
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,083
Let's go! Soul Resonance!

339
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,875
Huh...? It looks like their
souls have begun to expand.

340
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,541
Now they're showing
off their true strength.

341
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,083
Okay...! Let's see what
you've got, huh?

342
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,125
"Reaper Shmeaper!" Bring it on!

343
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,708
Execution mode, ready.

344
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,666
Prepare to die.

345
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,000
Um... I don't
like the looks of that.

346
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,750
Come on, what're
you gonna do, little man?!

347
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,500
I've swatted flies
scarier than you...!

348
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,666
So there!

349
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,875
[Liz]
Resonance stable...

350
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,750
Noise at zero
point three percent.

351
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,291
[Patty] Black Needle
soul wavelength--

352
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,166
fully charged.

353
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,625
[Liz]
Preparing to fire...

354
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,625
Feedback in four seconds.

355
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,750
Three.

356
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,458
[Patty]
Two.

357
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,500
One.

358
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,166
Firing now!

359
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,958
[Kid]
Death... Cannon.

360
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,083
This doesn't look good...!

361
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,125
We should run.

362
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,208
Hah...! Don't be ridiculous.

363
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,333
No way is something like
that gonna hurt me!

364
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,291
That's impossible!

365
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,333
[explosion]

366
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,541
Black Star!

367
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,166
Oh man. What were
those idiots thinking?

368
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,500
Looks like a decisive defeat.

369
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,458
[Stein thinks] But... you can
hardly expect anything less

370
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,541
from the son of
the Grim Reaper.

371
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,666
His potential is great...

372
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,958
and already far above that

373
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,291
of any other meister
at the academy.

374
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,833
And somehow I have a

375
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,750
feeling that he still isn't
showing us everything he can do.

376
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,875
Lord Death's very
own flesh and blood...

377
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,333
What I wouldn't give
to study that one.

378
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,583
[Patty]
Aye-yai-yai.

379
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,083
Great, here we go again.

380
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,125
[Stein]
What happened to him?

381
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:16,958
Not much.

382
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,625
It's just a little cut.

383
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,833
What got cut?

384
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,708
I think I might have
an idea of what it was.

385
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,375
[Maka] Well... I'm pretty sure
it happened during

386
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,458
Soul's last attack on kid...

387
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,833
I think that Kid got a

388
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,416
little hair cut off
from his bangs.

389
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,333
After the explosion happened
and things died down...

390
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,750
Kid finally noticed that

391
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,666
one side of his bangs was
shorter than the other...

392
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,958
His symmetry was off,

393
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,291
so he spit up
blood and fell over.

394
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,583
He's the one bleeding now,

395
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,500
so that means we actually
won the fight, huh?

396
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,416
Yeah, right...

397
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,541
It means we won, and I,

398
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,625
Black Star, have
defeated the Reaper...!

399
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,083
I knew it! ...Who's going to be
talking about this guy now?!

400
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,750
[Black Star laughs]

401
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,791
Are you really sure

402
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,333
you're all right now,
Black Star?

403
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,125
Hell yeah,

404
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,125
of course I'm all right...

405
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,666
I beat Death today!
I'm awesome!

406
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,791
[Tsubaki]
Yeah... It was amazing.

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,375
[Maka]
Hey.

408
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,333
Hey.

409
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,625
Don't let yourself get involved
in stupid fights, all right?

410
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,125
Come on...

411
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,208
That's exactly what
you used to tell me, Soul.

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,833
Yeah, I guess I was the
uncool one of us today, huh?

413
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,541
[Tsubaki] Please try not to do
anything too crazy from now on.

414
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,583
Yeah, right...

415
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,333
Nothing's too
crazy for me now...

416
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,958
I've beaten up
a Reaper, after all.

417
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,000
What's crazier than that?

418
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,833
[Maka] Tsubaki's the
only one for him.

419
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,333
I don't think anyone else
could handle Black Star.

420
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,000
[Soul] Yeah...

421
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,875
...you're probably right.

422
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,750
[Maka]
Coming?

423
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

424
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,000
[Soul]
Sorry.

425
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,333
[Maka] Let's stay cool, okay?

426
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,875
[Soul]
You got it.

427
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,666
[Death]
What's up...? Whassup...?

428
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,666
Whaaaazzzup?

429
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,708
Hi there Lord Death!

430
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,083
[Death]
So, I heard my son had

431
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,125
an eventful first
day at school...

432
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,125
Kid can be
difficult sometimes...

433
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,833
I hope no one's hurt too badly.

434
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,833
[Maka thinks]
I wonder...

435
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:54,041
What does the soul of
Lord Death look like?

436
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll take a look.

437
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,041
[Maka thinks] Huh...?
I can't see it.

438
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,291
[Death]
All right, everyone...

439
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm going to go ahead
and take Kid home now...

440
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:14,041
I think he could use
a little rest... Byyyee!

441
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,083
[Black Star]
Right! See ya later.

442
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,291
[Maka thinks]
I don't understand...

443
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,458
Kid's his son,
and he has a soul...

444
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,416
I saw it with my own eyes...

445
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,125
Why can't I see Lord Death's?

446
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,208
[Soul]
Hey...! Maka!

447
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
What are you doing
standing around like that...?

448
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,583
Let's go back inside.

449
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,500
[Maka]
Yeah, okay.

450
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,000
[Maka]
I guess it's possible that

451
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,125
Lord Death just
doesn't have a soul.

452
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,250
[Maka]
Oh well... Whatever.

I'll punch you in the face.

brawling, dueling...

463
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,625
every day, they seem to get into
more trouble than the last...

But maybe a little romance
will slow 'em down...
