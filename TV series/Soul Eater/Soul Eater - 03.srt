...more commonly
known as the DWMA.

6
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,416
It stands as a defense
against the forces of evil,

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,541
which would plunge the
world into chaos and

8
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,041
drag humanity to the very
depths of fear and madness--

00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,875
the demons known as Kishin,

10
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,541
and their insatiable
hunger for destruction.

11
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,791
To ensure the Kishin
never regain their

this academy was founded by

So basically...

15
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,666
we're an organization
that exists

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,750
to protect and preserve peace.

17
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,916
I guess it's not
exactly a typical school...

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,958
Oh well,
that isn't important...

Your soul has

It is pure evil.

Ah, Kid...

00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,333
Do you really think now

33
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,958
is the time to be
worrying about that?

[Kid]
Yes, I do...

00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,208
I want it to be
perfect every time.

I know, but do you think
that this once, maybe--

quiet and listen
when I'm talking?

Is that so much to ask, huh?

00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,166
Okay.

[Kid]
Symmetry is key...

45
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,541
Everything must be

Oh wonderful. Here we go.

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,916
[Kid] That's why I use the

When I hold you both,

I'm completely balanced
on the right and left...

51
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,666
It isn't perfect because
your human forms are so

52
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,541
different from each
other, though.

53
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,166
Your hairstyles and
height for example.

54
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,041
Even your boobs
are different sizes!

Excuse me for being
smaller than my little sister!

What right do you have to
talk about symmetry, anyway?!

Three stripes on the left side

none on the right...?

00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,458
That doesn't look
symmetrical to me!

I'm an abomination...!

one set of stripes...?!

Now, now, Kid.

You can't forget that
you're a Grim Reaper...

00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,708
Yeah, Kid,
you're not garbage!

If you were garbage
then you'd smell a lot worse.

So why don't we just
get up and try again, okay?

You don't think I'm

Stop it Dad...

89

I'm not a little kid anymore.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,708
Is that really necessary?

91
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,250
That's a sensitive
topic right now sir.

But Kid... don't forget...

98
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,666
You're a Grim Reaper...

99
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,833
You don't really need to

100
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,958
be training weapons
or reclaiming souls.

101
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,750
Even so, I want to
make my own weapons,

102
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,458
to my own specifications.

103
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,250
[Death] In that case,
since you have two weapons,

104
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,000
the number of souls
you must collect is double

105

106
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,583

I do have one.

Magnificent Mission?

132
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,125
[Death] In the heart of the
scorching Egyptian desert,

133
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,541
there is an ancient ruin...

134
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,750
It is known as the
pyramid of Anubis.

135
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,291
You will find a witch there,
a necromancer...

136
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,666
She's raised a great number

137
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,500
of the dead who were
entombed in the pyramid.

138
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,708
Every night, she leads

139
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,541
out these mummies
to feed on human souls.

140
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,708
A necromancer is
difficult to stop...

141
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,875
Her first set of mummies

142
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,791
will be sent out to
create another set,

143
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,750
which will in turn
create yet another,

144
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,291
until she eventually has
an entire army of mummies.

145
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,875
The ancient pyramid
of Anubis. I see...

146
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,666
It was built at a time
when all construction

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,833
followed strict theories
of symmetry...

148
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,125
Sounds great.

149
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:18,958
Actually...

150
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,291
I was originally thinking

151
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,583
about assigning a three-star
meister to this one.

152
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,583
Don't worry Dad...

153
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,541
I can handle it myself.

154
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,333
[Kid thinks] After
I've defeated the witch,

155
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,208
I can take some time
to enjoy the architecture.

156
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,166
So... what do you guys think?

157
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,458
[Soul] Anyone else want
to go find out who

158
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,041
took on the big mission?

159
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,416
Yeah, of course I do.

160
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Whoever this guy is,
he's a real show off.

161
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,666
He actually thinks he

162
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,583
can build a bigger
reputation than mine!

163
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,708
Kay, then let's get going.

164
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,083
Hey wait...
come back you two!

165
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,958
[Soul and Black Star yelling]

166
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,541
[Kid] Oh...! Would you just look
at the exquisite symmetry!

167
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,750
All that time in weapon

168
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,291
form makes my back
ache like crazy.

169
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,416
[Patty]
That thing's huuuuuge!

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
[wind gusts]

171
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,958
[Kid] I could do
without all this dust.

172
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,708
Let's all go inside then, okay?

173
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,125
[Liz] Are we sure that
we wanna do this?

174
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,375
This place gives
me the creeps.

175
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,458
[Patty] It's okay!
I'm sure we'll be fine...

176
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,833
Let's go!

177
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,791
[Kid]
My eyes itch.

178
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,625
[Kid] Wow...

179
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,958
It's perfect on
the inside, too!

180
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,291
[Liz]
I hate it here...

181
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,916
I don't do well in
creepy, dusty, icky places.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,375
Hey, sis, I've been
wondering something.

183
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,541
How come everyone

184
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,166
always closes their eyes
when they sneeze?

185
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,250
Is it to keep their eyes from
popping out of their heads?

186
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
Do you know?

187
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,083
I don't know, Patty.

188
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,000
That is certainly one theory
that might explain why it is...

189
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,500
Of course, it could also be

190
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,166
an involuntary reflex triggered
by normal brain activity.

191
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,583
[Patty]
Hmm... Maybe I could do a

192
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,666
test next time I have a
cold and tape my eyelids open!

193
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,416
Yes, but what if your
theory is right and

194
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
your eyeballs do pop
out of your head?

195
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, yeah...

196
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,333
You might be right
there, big sis.

197
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,208
You're so smart!

198
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,750
Kid, what's wrong with you...?

199
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,583
You've been quiet
for a long time now.

200
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,750
Hmm...?

201
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,208
Well, uh... Maybe
it's my imagination...

202
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,458
but I have this horrible
feeling that the painting that

203
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,750
I have hanging in my
living room is leaning

204
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,458
a little bit to the right.

205
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,541
Does some stupid painting
really matter right now?!

206
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,166
[Kid] Yes, of course
it matters...!

207
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,166
What should I do...?

208
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,125
I can't go on like this!

209
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,791
I can't wait...!

210
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,875
I have to go back
and make sure!

211
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:40,833
[Liz] Hey! Hey...!

212
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,375
Hey! Hey! Hey!

213
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
[Patty laughs]

214
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,375
[Liz] There's a limit to the
insanity I'll put up with...

215
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,125
You can worry about
it when we get home.

216
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,833
[Kid] I'm worrying about it.
I'm worrying about it.

217
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,041
--I'm worrying about it.

218
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,166
Don't worry. I won't
let you worry about it!

219
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,541
Shut up...!

220
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,833
--You spoiled brat!
--I'm worrying! I'm worrying.

221
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,708
Worrying!

222
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,708
[Liz screams]

223
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,125
Oh no! It's a mummy!

224
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,125
Mummy mummy mummy!

225
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:08,500
[Mummies giggle]

226
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,666
Hey... They're kinda
cute, aren't they?

227
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,125
[Patty giggles]

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,583
[Liz] A mummy licked me!
A mummy licked me!

229
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,291
A mummy licked me!

230
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,958
Mummy slobber!

231
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,458
How could this happen to me...?

232
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,166
It's time to transform, Patty!

233
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,541
Okay!

234
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,416
Hey, Kid, let's go!

235
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,375
Huh?

236
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,250
Don't know.

237
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,083
[Kid voice over]
Dear Liz and Patty...

238
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,458
I'm still worrying about it.

239
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,916
Nothing you can say will help...

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,875
I am going back home

241
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,583
at once to check
on the painting.

242
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,875
Watch your step.

243
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,916
It's dark in the pyramid.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,166
Death the Kid.

245
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,125
[Liz]
He's joking, right?!

246
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,250
Patty.

247
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,708
Right!

248
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,000
Beat it! Mummy!

249
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,000
Patty! Don't stick me in that
monster's dirty mouth! Eww!

250
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,083
Oh, okay. Sorry!

251
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,083
[Samantha]
Ancient statue...

252
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,166
I lend you the dark
heart from my body...

253
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,541
that you may live again
and do my bidding.

254
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,000
Awaken, Pharaoh...

255
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,041
Your master is calling you.

256
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,666
[Pharaoh] The wrath
of the Pharaoh.

257
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,333
[Samantha]
He's gotten me...!

258
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,125
I'm being dragged in...!

259
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,458
He's going to eat my soul!

260
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,875
[Pharaoh]
There is no one in

261
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,916
this world who can
ever be my master.

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,583
All who enter beware...
The wrath of the Pharaoh.

263
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,458
Where do you suppose those
two idiots have run off to now?

264
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,791
Just my imagination after all.

265
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,583
It's perfect.

266
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,875
And now...

267
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,916
...the girls are waiting for
me to come back...

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,500
I should get going.

269
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,083
[Liz]
That's it...

270
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,708
We've recovered every last
one of the mummies' souls.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,791
Do we have them
all evenly split up?

272
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,041
Since Kid would get all

273
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,875
depressed if we didn't
divide them up evenly.

274
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,208
I don't like this...

275
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,000
Did you hear that creepy noise
coming from over that way?

276
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,875
Huh-uh.

277
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,125
Let's just go!

278
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,166
[Liz] Why don't we wait
until Kid comes back?

279
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
Nah, it'll be okay...

280
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,708
I've got my big
sis here with me.

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,583
Oh no!

282
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,500
[Liz] The noise...
It's coming from down here.

283
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,791
Quietly, Patty...

284
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,916
We need to be quiet.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
[Patty]
I got it, I got it.

286
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:40,416
Oh no! Did you see that
thing move over there?!

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,791
[Liz] Don't do that, Patty;
it isn't funny.

288
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,041
[Patty laughs]

289
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,208
[Samantha] Oh dear...
I'm leftovers.

290
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,875
[Liz screams]

291
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,250
[Sid] What are you
two doing here?

292
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,500
The bell rang. Your classes
have already started.

293
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,125
What are we doing?
What about you?

294
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,500
You're a teacher right...?
Shouldn't you be in class, too?

295
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,916
I have other things to
take care of right now...

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,583
I'm a teacher and a busy man.

297
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,041
You two should move along.

298
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,291
Yeah, we will.

299
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,750
But before we get going,

300
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,708
there's something we need
you to tell us about first.

301
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,541
We want to know about
the Pyramid of Anubis.

302
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,375
Who signed up to
take the mission?

303
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,166
[Sid] That mission wasn't taken
by a student from our school...

304
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,791
It's much too difficult
for one of you.

305
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,875
If not one of us,
then who took it?

306
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,041
It was taken by
Lord Death's son.

307
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,000
Lord Death has a son?

308
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,875
Well, I'll be damned... 

309
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,416
Really?

310
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,958
Yes, really. I'm not a
man to tell a lie.

311
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,333
He's a Grim Reaper
just like his father...

312
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,625
His name is Death the Kid.

313
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,541
[Kid] Nice to see
you again, Anubis.

314
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,208
You're even more beautiful
than the last time we met.

315
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,833
[Kat Ball]
Meow.

316
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,416
What are you!

317
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,333
Such perfect symmetry!

318
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,875
You are amazing!

319
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,333
Hey, no.

320
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,250
You make me sick! Get away!

321
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,625
How incredibly disappointing.

322
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,625
Liz! Patty!

323
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,958
Kid, here.

324
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,166
[Kid]
Didn't mean to intrude.

325
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,208
Hey hey hey hey!

326
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,708
[Kid]
What is this...?

327
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,041
You two hurry up and
switch to weapon form.

328
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,333
Our powers don't work with
us wrapped up in these bandages.

329
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,541
[Kid]
What?!

330
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,291
Tornado... Flip!

331
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,958
Okay!

332
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,833
And... go!

333
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,583
[Kid]
A Pharaoh's soul, huh?

334
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,250
Now it will be mine.

335
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,000
What's happening, Kid?
Are you okay?

336
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,125
Kid, why don't
you do something...?

337
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,000
This isn't like you!

338
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,875
Look at the Pharaoh closely...

339
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,333
He is...

340
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,625
Perfectly symmetrical
in every way.

341
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,666
[Liz screams]

342
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,666
[Liz]
Kid!

343
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,291
[Liz]
Forget about the symmetry...!

344
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,791
It doesn't matter right now...!

345
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,333
You'll die if you
don't do something fast!

346
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,625
You're supposed to become
a great Grim Reaper

347
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,750
with us as your weapons.

348
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,708
Don't let us down!

349
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,041
No, I can't.

350
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,875
[Kid thinks] I can't pull
the trigger on him.

351
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,583
[Liz]
Kid!

352
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,958
[Patty]
Kid!

353
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,500
[Pharaoh]
The wrath of the Pharaoh.

354
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,791
Wrath...! Wrath...!

355
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,791
Wrath...! Wrath...! Wrath...!

356
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,208
Wrath...! Wrath...!

357
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,958
Wrath...! Wrath...!
Wrath...! Wrath...!

358
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:48,041
I will come and deliver
the final blow myself.

359
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:03,083
[Kid]
Right...left...right...

360
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,958
...left...right.

361
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,041
[Kid] You're
disgustingly hideous!

362
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,791
It's all over now.

363
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,083
[Patty laughs]

364
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,250
[Kid] What the hell kind
of thing are you...?

365
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,208
I've never seen anything
so messed up in my life...

366
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,708
Do you know nothing
about symmetry...?

367
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,916
Whoever made you should
be dug up from his grave,

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,500
shot, and reburied!

369
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,666
You make me violently ill.

370
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,333
Just look at your forehead.

371
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,833
You don't deserve
such a jewel...

372
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,916
...in fact...

373
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,583
...you don't even
deserve to exist.

374
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,208
Disgusting, disgusting,

375
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,916
disgusting, disgusting,

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,333
disgusting, disgusting,
disgusting...

377
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,208
You are disgusting,
disgusting, disgusting!

378
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,083
[Kid]
I feel much better now.

379
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,666
[Liz] Kid, we collected an odd
number of souls this time,

380
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,208
so I have one more than Patty.

381
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,208
[Kid] Damn it,
I can't handle that...

382
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,375
We need another mission.

383
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,750
[Patty]
Okay!

384
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,375
[Kid] I want to put this whole
episode behind me...

385
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,208
That Pharaoh
was absolutely horrific.

386
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,833
At any rate,
the mission is over...

387
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,416
Let's say goodbye to
the beautiful Anubis.

388
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,000
[cracks and explosion]

389
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,000
You broke the Pharaoh!

390
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,500
--You broke the Pharaoh!
--Uh-- what'd we do?

391
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,333
You went a little nuts in
there, don't ya think...? Crazy.

392
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,000
--[Kid] I'm a pig...! A louse!
--You broke the Pharaoh...!

393
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,375
--A useless cow...!
--You broke the Pharaoh...!

394
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,750
--I destroyed Anubis...!
--You broke the Pharaoh...!

395
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,541
Such utter garbage cannot
be allowed to live...

396
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,083
I deserve to die!

397
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,541
No, you don't need to die...

398
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,958
I mean, who hasn't destroyed

399
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,958
one or two pyramids
in their life, really?

400
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,041
See, it's okay.

401
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,875
Girls, thank you...

402
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,083
[Kid] But why are your breasts
still two different sizes!?

403
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,333
[Death] As punishment
for destroying

404
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,750
the Pyramid of Anubis,

405
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,291
all of the souls you've
collected will be confiscated.

406
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,166
[Kid] Damn it...!

407
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,166
I'm garbage...! I'll die!

408
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,750
[Narrator] There is the
Scythe Meister...

409
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,083
Maka... and her
partner and weapon...

410
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,541
Soul Eater.

411
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,000
The assassin, Black Star...

412
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,041
...with the magic
Dark Arm, Tsubaki.

413
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,125
And Lord Death's son...

414
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,291
Death the Kid...

415
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,666
...with his twin pistols,
Liz and Patty...

416
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,541
The Thompson sisters.

417
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,083
The prologue is complete.

418
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,958
And now...
the real story can begin.

[Maka]
Hey, Soul...

421
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,250
Why is this happening to me?

422
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,416
[Soul]Because
you're annoying...?

423
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,875
How the hell am
I supposed to know.

424
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,375
[Maka] I'm an 'A' student,
unlike you and Black Star...

425
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,208
...and I study a lot and turn
my homework in on time!

426
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,083
[Soul] Please, don't compare
me to Black Star.

427
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,041
[Maka] This is impossible!

428
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,333
It must be a mistake!

429
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,291
Please tell me it isn't true!

430
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,166
[Soul]
Calm down...

431
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,500
It's only an extra class.

But why am I in it?!

[Soul] On the next
episode of Soul Eater...

434
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,958
Engage the Witch Hunter!

435
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,958
A Remedial Lesson
in the Graveyard?

436
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,583
[Maka] Watch it...
Or I'll take your soul.
