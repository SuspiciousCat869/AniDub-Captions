00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,875
so they didn't
take my soul...

161
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,416
That's when the
school took me in.

162
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,833
That's it... The end.

163
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,166
But is it though...?

164
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,375
You don't resent the
academy for what they did?

165
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,458
[Black Star] Nah,
this was all way back when...

166
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,625
So long ago that I wasn't
even close to being

167
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,500
the big star I am now. 

168
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,708
It was a simple case
of cause and effect...

169
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,875
My old man and old lady

170
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,541
crossed a line
they shouldn't have...

171
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,583
...and they paid for it

172
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,208
by having their
souls taken away...

173
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,166
That's all there is to it.

174
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah, I guess...

175
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,041
...but I still don't like
to see people treating

176
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,666
you so badly for it...

177
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,333
It wasn't your fault.

178
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,041
Come on, are you
kidding me...?

179
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,333
All because of my name,

180
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:30,250
I was the center of
attention earlier! Yahoo!

181
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,958
Remember a little while ago...

182
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,541
...when I said I had
something I needed to tell you?

183
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,875
[Black Star] You don't have to
tell me until you're ready.

184
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,958
I don't know how
you're connected

185
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,000
to the Enchanted Sword...

186
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,041
...but he's an enemy we
have to defeat, isn't he?

187
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,125
That's all I need
to know to fight him...

188
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,333
Take some time to get
whatever's inside you settled.

189
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,500
And then you can tell me
everything you need to tell.

190
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,708
[Tsubaki]
Okay.

191
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,750
[Black Star] The rain's
starting to come down harder.

192
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,791
[thunder clap]

193
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,833
[Masamune]
I could stand here thinking...

194
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,833
Or go sleep... or play...

195
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,500
Or...

196
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,666
Eat!

197
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,708
[thunder clap]

198
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,208
[Maka]
Lord Death!

199
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,541
I wanna know why you
sent them after Masamune? 

200
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,750
[Death] Whoa!
Easy there, meister...!

201
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,791
Who invited you to the
Death Room in the first place?

202
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,500
[Maka] The one hundred
and eighteenth rule in

203
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,750
the Death Weapon Meister
Academy handbook states:

204
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,916
In the event of an emergency,
students are allowed to

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,375
enter the Death Room without
first obtaining permission."

206
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,833
[Death]
Really...? It does?

207
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,958
[Kid] What type of enemy is
this Enchanted Sword, father?

208
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,625
[Death] Kid, you've come
to join the party?

209
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,833
The Enchanted Sword guy's

210
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,791
not like the Demon
Sword guy, is he?

211
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,458
I hope not.

212
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,791
The Enchanted Sword doesn't
have a witch with him...

213
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,833
He might actually be
less dangerous if he was

214
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,875
under a witch's supervision.

215
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,166
The Enchanted Sword takes

216
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,541
advantage of the
fear in people's hearts...

217
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,041
He uses that fear in order to

218
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,791
take possession of
his targets...

219
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,208
And gain control
of their bodies.

220
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,416
He then consumes
his victims' souls...

221
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,333
Unless someone stops him...

222
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,125
He will become a Kishin.

223
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,166
[thunder clap]

224
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,250
[Ryoku] How could that
Star clan murderer

225
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
dare to show up here?!

226
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,333
Will this sickle do
any good against

227
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,583
someone like him?

228
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,541
I'm old enough now to
get revenge for what they did...

229
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:48,416
It was those assassins who
killed my mother and father.

230
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,750
[Masamune]
You see, I think...

231
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,791
And therefore, I am.

232
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,041
And therefore, I eat.

233
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,625
Hey, who are you?

234
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,916
[Masamune]
I think, therefore I eat...

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,875
You have fear hiding
in your soul, don't you?

236
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,291
Fear? What would make
you think that?

237
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,458
No, I don't have any fear.

238
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,166
We'll see now, won't we?

239
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,625
With my power...

240
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,750
Your fear could
disappear for good...

241
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,916
Gone, just like that...

242
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,208
What do you say?

243
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,958
[thunder clap]

244
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,250
[rain pouring down]

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,125
[Old Man] Ah, Ryoku... so this
is where you've been hiding.

246
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,083
I brought some stuff
we can use as weapons if

247
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,958
that assassin comes back.

248
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,375
Thirteen years ago we
put up those needles...

249
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,791
In all that time we haven't
had a single thief come along...

250
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,375
Not that you have
anything to worry about.

251
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,416
I'll protect the village
like I did in the old days...

252
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm still just as spry
as I used to be.

253
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,375
No one can take me.

254
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,875
[Old Man] That's an
interesting sword you got...

255
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,916
What's a fancy old weapon
like that doing in here?

256
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,916
Ryoku... are you okay?

257
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,541
[Old Man screams]

258
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,875
It's him!

259
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,916
Let's go!

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,375
Right!

261
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:26,000
No... wait Ryoku...
what's gotten into you?

262
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,291
[Masamune] Ryoku...?
Who is this Ryoku...?

263
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,208
I am the Enchanted
Sword Masamune.

264
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,291
I think, therefore
I am hungry... for souls!

265
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,333
[Old Man groans with fear]

266
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,208
[Black Star]
Ya--hoo!

267
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,500
You're the Enchanted Sword, huh?

268
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,791
Wait a sec...

269
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,291
You're the bratty
kid from earlier,

270
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,375
the one with the money.

271
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,166
What the hell's happening here?

272
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,250
It's the Soul Possession
technique...

273
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,500
Just one thing that
sword can do.

274
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,291
I've never heard
of that before...

275
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,875
How's it supposed to work?

276
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,958
[Tsubaki] You know how normal
meisters, and weapons match

277
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,791
each other's soul wavelengths
to unify themselves...?

278
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,791
The Enchanted Sword
doesn't do that...

279
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,791
Instead of matching,
he simply takes over

280
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,291
a person's soul and
controls their body.

281
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,083
And when he's finished,
the host's soul is devoured.

282
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,791
[Tsubaki]
That's the Enchanted Sword...

283
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,500
Its blade was so
beautiful once,

284
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,416
but now that beauty
is clouded by darkness.

285
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,208
[Masamune]
Oh, it's you, is it?

286
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,750
Tsubaki...what now?

287
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,541
He may be powerful but

288
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,333
he can't control two soul
wavelengths at one time.

289
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,666
Listen, Black Star...

290
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,750
If you shoot your soul

291
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,375
wavelength directly
into that boy,

292
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,416
the Enchanted Sword will be
forced to separate from him.

293
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,041
After that,
leave the rest up to me.

294
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,458
Just shoot my
soul wavelength at 'em.

295
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,166
That's all you
want me to do?

296
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,625
[Tsubaki]
Yes.

297
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,625
[Tsubaki]
I joined the academy in

298
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,041
order to hunt down
the Enchanted Sword.

299
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,500
This is my fight.

300
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,958
And I'm sorry...

301
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,541
...to put you in the
middle, Black Star.

302
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,958
Tsubaki...

303
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,166
Come on. Please tell me

304
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,166
that isn't what you're
actually thinking...

305
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,500
You know better
than that don't you?

306
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:34,041
Weapons and meisters... depend
on each other, don't we?

307
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,458
[Black Star] You can
lean on me, Tsubaki...

308
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,625
And you can do it a

309
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,500
heck of a lot more
than you do now, got it?

310
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,208
Yes.

311
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,416
Puppet Shadow.

312
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,583
[Tsubaki]
Black Star!

313
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,416
What the hell was that?

314
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,916
[Shadow] Shadow...
shadow... shadow!

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,083
[Black Star] You gotta
be kidding me...!

316
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,333
The Enchanted Sword can

317
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,375
even control a possessed
person's shadow?!

318
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,916
[Shadow]
Shadow!

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,958
[Masamune]
Get him, puppet!

320
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,208
So it's two against one, huh?

321
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,125
Let's shake this thing, Tsubaki!

322
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,375
Ninja sword mode.

323
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,833
[Tsubaki]
Right!

324
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,958
Speed Star!

325
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,833
[Black Star]
Ha! You missed...!

326
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,666
I'm too fast.

327
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,041
You can't catch me!

328
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,000
Yahoo...!
Can't see me, can you...?

329
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,000
Nope, I bet you can't...!

330
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,375
And do you know why...?

331
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,375
Because I'm one dude
who's way ahead of his time...

332
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,541
You'll be lucky to even
see one hair on my head...!

333
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,583
Blink for just one second,
and you'll miss me...

334
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,750
That's how fast I am...! Yah--

335
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,875
[Tsubaki]
I think you may want to

336
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,375
save Speed Star for days
when it isn't raining.

337
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,416
I'm just a dude who's

338
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,375
way ahead of
his time, you know...

339
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,958
Does that mean
I was born too early,

340
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,125
because time can't
keep up with me...?

341
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:14,666
Man, Speed Star...
is way deep, huh?

342
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,708
[Shadow]
Shadow!

343
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,416
Ow! Ow...!

344
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,666
It's all I can do
to avoid his attacks...

345
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,833
I don't have any time to
hit him with one of my own!

346
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,208
I have to do something!

347
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,500
Playtime's over...

348
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,416
Now we fight for real.

349
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
[Tsubaki]
That stance!

350
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,750
Careful, Black Star...!

351
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,958
He's going to shoot
a beam from the sword.

352
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,458
Now die.

353
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,916
Puppet Thrust!

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,375
[Black Star]
I see it.

355
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,125
[Black Star thinks]
Blocked!

356
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,166
Branch out, shadow!

357
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,000
[Shadow]
Sha-dow!

358
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,541
[Black Star thinks]
I'm not done with you, not yet.

359
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,791
[Shadow]
Shadow!

360
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,458
[Black Star thinks] Damn...!
I'm still ahead...

361
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,500
It's not my time yet.

362
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,958
[Black Star thinks]
Come on...

363
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,458
Come on...

364
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,916
Come on...

365
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,500
Is it my time now?

366
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,083
Tsubaki...! Kusarigama!

367
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,541
[Tsubaki]
Right!

368
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,041
Now?

369
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,416
[Black Star]
Now!

370
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,875
Here we go, Tsubaki!

371
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,333
Okay!

372
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,083
[Black Star and Tsubaki]
Let's go! Soul Resonance!

373
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,625
[Black Star]
Shield Star!

374
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,291
[Tsubaki] I'll do
anything to defeat you.

375
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,416
You dive relentlessly
into destruction without

376
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,333
considering what lies ahead.

377
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,333
And now Black Star has you!

378
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,500
Puppet!

379
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,541
[Shadow]
Shadow!

380
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,666
Your time is finished now!

381
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,416
Mid-air combat is
something I'm good at.

382
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,958
Which makes this...
my time!

383
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,583
Now, Tsubaki!

384
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,041
[Tsubaki]
Right!

385
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,791
[Tsubaki thinks]
Black Star... Thank you.

386
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,250
I'll be back.

387
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,500
Oh, interesting...

388
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,250
I see... You're planning to
come inside, aren't you?

389
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,041
[Tsubaki thinks] From this point
forward, it really is my fight.

390
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,875
I will bring down
the Enchanted Sword.

391
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,791
[Tsubaki screams]

392
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,041
[Soul]
What just happened?

393
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,250
[Stein] Tsubaki's gone inside
the Enchanted Sword.

394
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,541
Why would you do that,
Tsubaki...?

395
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,083
We have to stop this somehow!

396
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,500
What is she thinking?

397
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,333
How is a weapon supposed
to fight without her meister?

398
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,041
[Death]
You don't get it.

399
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,041
The fight is taking
place inside their souls...

400
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,041
Anything could happen now.

401
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,458
It had to come to this...

402
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,541
You see... Tsubaki is the only

403
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,416
one who can stand
against the Enchanted Sword.

404
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
[thunder clap]

405
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,000
[Black Star]
Tsubaki...

406
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,625
You're in, make sure
you come back.

407
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,500
[Tsubaki] This is the
inside of the sword.

408
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,750
[Tsubaki]
Where are you?

409
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,708
[Tsubaki] I know what
you're going to do...

410
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,458
You'll come after my soul...

411
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,958
You'll try to possess it.

412
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,500
[Masamune]
Soul Possession...?

413
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,000
No... not that.

414
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:25,166
I think I'll devour your
soul just the way it is.

415
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,208
[Masamune]
It's so nice to see you...

416
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,666
...Tsubaki.

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,583
Hi, brother.

418
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,416
[Both]
Ready?

420

[Maka] Hey, Soul!
The preview's already started!

421
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,000
[Soul] Uh-oh! We don't
have much time left...!

422
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,041
What should I say...?

423
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,541
I can't think of anything!

424
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,500
[Maka] Well, hurry up. We only
have fifteen seconds left.

425
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,041
[Soul] I dunno.
I'm all choked up...

426
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,166
I've barely said anything
until this preview.

427
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
[Maka]
You're useless.

On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

429
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:46,541
Tsubaki, the Camellia Blossom...
What Lies Beyond the Grief?~

430
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,333
Watch it...

00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,458
...or I'll take your soul!

take my screen time!
