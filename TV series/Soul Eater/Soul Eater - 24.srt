...and a sound body.

4
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,500
[Stein narrates]
Our battle to stop the

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,583
Kishin's revival was
drawing to a close.

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,916
Death Scythe and I wanted to
end our fight with Medusa

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,333
as quickly as possible so we

8
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,416
could continue on
and help the others.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,750
But Medusa knew that
was our plan, and she did

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,791
everything she could to
draw the struggle out longer.

00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,208
[Stein narrates] After I hit
Medusa with my soul wavelength,

14
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,916
we found ourselves
in a deadlock.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,916
Neither of us could
take a single step.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,958
One movement could mean death.

Meanwhile, Kid and his group
fought one last battle against

18

to stop the Kishin's revival.

00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,833
[Stein narrates] Kid and
Black Star tried to destroy

23
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,375
the syringe that Medusa had
filled with black blood.

24
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,041
Eruka was attempting to inject
the black blood into the Kishin.

25
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,541
[Stein narrates] At first it
appeared that Black Star had

26
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,375
succeeded in
shattering the syringe

27
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,625
that would wake the Kishin.

28
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,833
But unfortunately...

29
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,791
Black Star had
been hallucinating.

30
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,791
We failed?

31
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,875
[Stein narrates]
At that moment, Medusa let her

32
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,500
guard down,
and our battle ended.

33
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,250
And then it happened...

34
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,166
The Kishin awoke.

[Asura] I take it that's
also why you talk

167
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,666
in a funny voice now?

168
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,458
Yes... I've grown quite used
to all of it over the years.

169
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,875
Now, I'm sorry to do this
right after you've woken up...

170
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,208
But it's time for
you to die again.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,958
Reaper... Chop!

172
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,208
[Asura laughs maniacally]

173
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,583
Tell me, Death.

174
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,666
Do you know the pain of

175
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,458
having all of
your skin torn off...

176
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,791
...ripped from
your entire body...?

177
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,250
I've actually forgotten
how it felt myself.

178
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,041
Try to make me remember!

179
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,875
[Death]
Ka!

180
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,541
Shockwaves, huh?

181
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,250
[Asura] My turn.
Let's see how you like this.

182
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,291
[gothic-like chants]

183
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,875
[Asura powers up]

184
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,875
[Asura laughs]

185
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,125
[Death]
Oh no!

186
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,750
[Asura laughs]

187
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,583
What is all of this...?

188
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,125
What's going on here.

189
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,625
[Sid]
What are you doing?

190
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,875
Split up and help
anyone who's injured.

191
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,375
Oh... right.

192
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,791
Gather all of the civillians
and lead them out of town...

193
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,625
You got it?

194
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,291
Yes, sir!

195
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,375
[Sid thinks] A full-scale
battle between those two could

196
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,125
very well blow away
all of Death City.

197
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,375
Lord Death...

198
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,250
We're counting on you.

199
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,041
[Death] You're not
going anywhere!

200
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,541
[Asura struggles]

201
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,000
Whoa... now that is cool.

202
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,166
Ha!

203
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,333
[Death] He hasn't reached
full strength yet...

204
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,458
...but I don't have
my Death Scythes...

205
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,208
He may be able to
strike a blow that

206
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,458
would finish me off for good.

207
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,291
[Asura laughs]

208
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,750
[Asura]
Outta the way!

209
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,500
[Asura]
Vajra!

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,250
[Asura]
You can't stop me now!

211
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,083
Lord Death, no!

212
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,208
[Death] You filthy,
unforgivable swine...

213
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,833
That's it. I'm going to
skin you alive again.

214
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,208
[Asura laughs]

215
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,750
They bounced away...?

216
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,375
But... how?

217
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,166
[Death]
You deflected my attack...

218
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,916
Damn you, shrewd demon.

219
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,041
You knew there was a
boundary past which my

220
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,541
attacks wouldn't
be able to hit you?

221
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,583
I doubt we'll ever
be meeting again.

222
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,583
Goodbye, master...

223
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,458
It's been fun.

224
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,375
[Sid]
Lord Death!

225
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,583
[Death] Sid...
our first priority is

226
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,875
taking care of the students
who went underground to fight.

227
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,250
Right.

228
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,333
[Death] We'll need
reinforcements...

229
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,708
Contact the Death Scythes

230
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,958
that are scattered
across the continents... 

231
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,708
Tell them to gather...

232
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,583
Quickly.

233
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,250
Yes, sir.

234
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:21,833
[Death] To think a Kishin would
revive on today of all days...

235
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,875
The anniversary celebration
of the academy I built to

236
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,458
prevent the creation
of more Kishins.

237
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:32,250
Things are about to
get very busy.

238
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,500
[Eruka] We should be
safe here for now.

239
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
Who is this chick, anyway?

240
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,541
A combination of five Mizunes.

241
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,875
Oh, okay.

242
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,291
[Eruka] I can't sense
Medusa's magic anymore...

243
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,333
I guess that means
she died in there.

244
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,916
I just have one regret...

245
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,708
I didn't get to see her die.

246
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,083
In a way, though,
I suppose I did

247
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,250
kind of look up to her.

248
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,875
There aren't many witches
of her caliber out there.

249
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,750
Funny, huh?

250
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,166
It looks like Lord Death
and the Kishin were

251
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,625
fighting it out up here.

252
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,000
But the madness
seems to be fading.

253
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,833
He got away.

254
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,083
[Stein]
I wish I could've seen it.

255
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,416
If only I had stayed by

256
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,625
Lord Death's side like I'm
always supposed to...

257
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,708
...then we could have
stopped him...

258
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,083
Things turned out horribly...
and what's worse,

259
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,875
everyone'll blame me.

260
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,416
There's no use crying
over spilt milk, Spirit...

261
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,583
Besides, this isn't over yet...

262
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,125
If we can't figure out
a way to make this right...

263
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,875
we'll have a lot more
problems than your ego.

264
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,958
[Death Scythe]
Stein!

265
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,250
Damn!

266
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,041
I love you, you know...

267
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,041
... a man after my own heart.

268
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,916
Don't be stupid.

269
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,916
At your core, Medusa,
you're just like me...

270
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,416
You can't possibly understand
a concept like love.

271
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
What kind of woman...

272
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,791
...would be willing to
extinguish her own soul?

273
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,958
You can't imagine how
disastrous it will be...

274
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,625
...if the Kishin
is revived again...

275
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,333
Its madness will
spread like a plague.

276
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,333
[Death] It has been a very
long night indeed...

277
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,166
An exhausting, difficult night

278
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,500
that felt at times like
it would go on forever.

279
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,500
And yet...

280
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,333
...not all is hopeless...

281
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,625
Even after a night like this,

282
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,666
morning will eventually come.

283
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,666
Hot...! Hot...! Hot!

[Maka]
Hey, Mister Kishin,

287
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,250
it must feel good to be
outside after all this time.

288
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,291
What do you wanna do first?

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
[Asura]
