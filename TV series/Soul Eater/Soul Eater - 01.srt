It stands as a defense
against the forces of evil,

00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,500
which would plunge the world
into chaos and drag humanity

fear and madness--

the demons known as Kishin,

10
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,208
and their insatiable
hunger for destruction...

00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,166
To ensure the Kishin
never regain their hold

and additionally collect the
soul of one witch...

obtain the qualifications

when they challenged a witch.

You'll need to be
very careful, Maka...

111

But if you're lucky,

112
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,041
maybe the Death Scythe
you create will be as powerful

created before you.

I'm sure that's why
your nose is bleeding.

161
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,166
Yeah. Nevermind.

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,375
Your soul is mine--

163
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,333
[Maka] You idiot...!
What were you thinking?!

164
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,833
Sorry to interrupt...

165
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,166
...but I'll be taking
your soul now.

166
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,166
I hope that cute boy
will be all right...

167
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,625
Wha--

168
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,125
Could you transform
into a scythe?

169
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,083
Working on it, Maka.

170
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, that's it, witch lady...

171
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,000
Naked or not,

172
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,875
I'm still gonna
eat your soul now.

173
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,750
Witch lady?

174
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,958
Oh, wow...!

175
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,666
He really became a scythe.

176
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,000
After I take your soul,
he'll be much more...

177
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,958
Soul will be a Death Scythe.

178
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,083
And I'll have created a
weapon stronger than my dad!

179
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,166
[Blair[
I like it.

180
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,875
Why don't you be a good
little girl and give it to me.

181
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,125
Pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin...

182
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,791
Halloween Cannon!

183
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,958
[Death Scythe laughs]

184
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,541
[Lisa]
Wow, Death Scythe...

185
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,416
...you're a real
frisky one, aren't you?

186
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,916
Oh, and I heard that
you have a little daughter, too.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,208
Isn't that right?

188
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,958
What sort of girl is she?

189
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,125
You don't wanna ask that...

190
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,458
Trust me on this one.

191
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,083
Kay... but why?

192
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,916
Just in case you haven't
figured it out yet,

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
Death Scythe is
a bit of a player...

194
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,208
and that didn't go over
very well with his wife.

195
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,625
Huh...

196
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,791
They're in the process
of getting a divorce right now.

197
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,375
The worst thing is his

198
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,041
daughter Maka, is on her
mother's side. She hates him!

199
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,541
That sounds complicated...

200
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,541
Maka!

201
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,791
Please don't hate me, Maka!

202
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,458
I love you and Mama...!

203
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,916
I promise, Maka...!

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,958
It's true! It's true...!

205
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,000
I love you...!I love you!

206
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:04,125
Thank you very much, sir.

207
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,708
[Lisa and Arisa]
Bye, Mister Death Scythe!

208
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,333
Please come again!

209
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,083
[Death Scythe]
Yeah. [PAUSE]  Bye!

210
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,083
[Soul]
Damn that witch...!

211
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,333
How am I supposed to be cool

212
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,708
when she's all hot and
naked like that, huh?

213
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,041
We expected a stiff attack.

214
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,625
She is a witch.

215
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,750
But you lost your chance to
become a death scythe because

216
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,375
you couldn't resist her.

217
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,208
You're just jealous
of her boobs.

218
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,625
[Soul]
It's her. What now?

219
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,208
[Maka]
I'm thinking.

220
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,250
Ah! My little scythe-ey boy!

221
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,625
[Maka] Listen up, Soul...!

222
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,708
This time I wrote down

223
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,291
a detailed plan on this
piece of paper.

224
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,250
And that's supposed to
give us an edge this time?

225
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,416
We aren't exactly going
grocery shopping here.

226
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,583
A piece of paper isn't gonna
help us beat a witch.

227
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,625
Fine, then you tell me

228
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,125
what we need to
do to beat Blair!

229
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,000
Who knows?

230
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,000
I vote for brute force, though.

231
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,208
That's your answer
for everything!

232
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,375
We have to work together here,

233
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,791
or don't you wanna
become a Death Scythe?

234
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,916
--You have to take
--Yeah, I get it, Maka...

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,583
--this seriously, Soul!
--You can shut up now.

236
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,375
[Maka] This is a witch we're
going up against!

237
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,750
--Let's just follow my--!
--[Blair] Pumkin... Pum-Pumkin

238
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,125
--[Maka and Soul] Hmm?
--[Blair] Halloween cannon!

239
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,583
[explosion]

240
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,458
[Blair laughs]

241
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,541
You should give it up...

242
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,208
You can't beat me, girl.

243
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,708
[Soul] What are you
doing, you idiot?

244
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,875
[Maka]
Shut up!

245
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,041
Or were you just gonna try

246
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,166
beating her by getting
a nosebleed again?

247
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,500
Men are completely
useless sometimes...

248
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,541
You only ran into Blair's
house in the first place

249
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,291
because you knew
she was taking a bath!

250
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,875
Now you're just
making false accusations...!

251
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,666
And would you tell me
how girls always come up

252
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,958
with these wild assumptions
in the first place?!

253
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,333
Women's intuition.

254
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,500
[Soul] I don't understand
you sometimes.

255
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,125
Hey there, little scythe boy...

256
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,000
is that dumb girl of yours
giving you a hard time?

257
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,875
Why don't you forget about
her and come be mine...?

258
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,250
I would never, ever yell at you
like she is no matter

259
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,791
what you did to me.

260
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,625
[Maka]
Hold on, witch!

261
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm Soul's partner,
not you, okay...?

262
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,708
Our conversations
don't concern you.

263
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:23,250
[Blair]
Hmmmm...Is that so?

264
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,666
Well...We'll see
about that, girlie.

265
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,958
What the--

266
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,833
[Blair] Pum-Pumpkin, pumpkin...

267
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,083
Smashing Pumpkin!

268
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,541
[explosion]

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,583
[Maka cries out]

270
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,000
What should we try now, Soul...?

271
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,250
My attacks won't work on her!

272
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,750
Soul?

273
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,166
Soul? Hello...?

274
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,833
What's wrong?

275
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,166
Why don't you forget about
her and come be mine?

276
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,083
[Death Scythe chuckles]

277
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,166
Hah...!

278
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,666
Good times at Chupa Cabra's. 

279
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,833
You're out drinking when
your daughter's in trouble...?

280
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,625
What kind of father are you?

281
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,083
[Death Scythe]
What? Maka...?!

282
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,750
Something happened?

283
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,833
[Death] She's not doing so
well against this witch...

284
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,083
It looks like she might die.

285
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,708
What? Maka, hold on!

286
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,000
[Death]
Stop right there...

287
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,375
Think about what
you're doing...

288
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,791
You or I could win against

289
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,125
an opponent like
that with one blow...

290
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,458
A single Reaper Chop is

291
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,125
all it would take
to crush her skull...

292
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,458
We both know that, Death Scythe.

293
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:52,416
But our skills aren't
being tested right now.

294
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,666
You're her father...

295
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,333
You must understand
the situation.

296
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,458
Maka.

297
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,666
[Death] Still...There's
something a little

298
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,541
weird about that witch.

299
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,583
[explosion followed
by Maka bellowing]

300
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,666
Soul, what's going on?

301
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,541
I don't understand why
you haven't been answering me!

302
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,833
[Soul]
Maka...

303
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,500
There you are.

304
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,708
Stop talking.

305
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,291
Hey, what did you
drop me like that for?!

306
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,208
I don't think we should
be partners anymore Maka...

307
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:44,416
You see... I only want to be
Witch Blair's weapon now!

308
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,458
Oh! Do you really want me?

309
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,625
Yeah, that's more like it...

310
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,500
Leave my daughter alone,
ya little scumbag!

311
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,583
Is now really the time
to be saying that?

312
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,583
Blair! You used your magic
to make Soul want to

313
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,666
be with you.
That's a dirty trick!

314
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,625
[Soul]
You really are stupid...

315
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,500
Any man would choose a girl
with a body like Blair's

316
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,375
over you and your flat chest.

317
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,250
She didn't have to trick me to
make me pick her instead of you.

318
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,458
Now that you mention it,

319
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,958
that witch does have a really
nice body, doesn't she?

320
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,500
[whack]

321
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,166
[Death] It would be best if you
just shut up for a while.

322
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,916
[Maka]
You men.

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,416
All of you. You're horrible...

324
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,875
Cheating on every woman!

325
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:38,125
But you... You I actually
decided to trust.

326
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,625
I put my faith in you.

327
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,916
[Maka]
I can't believe this.

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,791
I wish that all of
you would just die!

329
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,166
Hey Soul...You said that all
women make wild assumptions

330
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,833
without reasoning
first, right...?

331
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,875
That's what you said?

332
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,250
Well, what reason do
men have for cheating...?!

333
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,291
It's not fair...

334
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,083
How am I supposed
to know? I can't answer that.

335
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,666
After all, cool men don't

336
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,583
cheat on their
partners, do they?

337
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,500
Maka!

338
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,708
We've got them all...
Good job.

339
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,041
[Maka thinking] Yes,
Soul...Thank you for that.

340
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,166
In the end, the shape and form
don't matter at all...

341
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,625
It's only the soul
that matters, right...?

342
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,500
Nothing else.

343
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,375
[Maka]
Once you eat that...

344
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,833
That's right... With this soul
I'll become a Death Scythe.

345
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,208
[Soul cries out]

346
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,458
The power...!

347
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,791
I can feel incredible power!

348
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,250
[Soul]
Or not.

349
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,375
[Soul burps]

350
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:24,125
No way.

351
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,041
Meow.

352
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,208
[Maka]
Don't tell me...

353
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,500
You're not really...

354
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,291
I never said that I
was a witch, did I?

355
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,333
You just made that
assumption all on your own.

356
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,833
I'm really just a cat with a

357
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,250
ridiculous amount
of magical power.

358
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,791
Huh?!

359
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,708
The shape and form don't
matter, isn't that right...?

360
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,291
Huh, Soul?

361
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,583
[Death]
Yes... Just as I suspected.

362
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,750
The cat'll do...

363
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,625
Yes, Blair...

364
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,750
I'll be your cat toy any day--

365
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,791
[whack]

366
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,875
[Soul] You've
gotta be kidding me...!

367
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,125
Does this mean
I ate 99 human souls

368
00:19:59,208 --> 00:19:59,958
and one cat soul?!

369
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,833
That just cannot be right!

370
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,583
And that's not all.

371
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,291
[Death] The witch's soul
is very important...

372
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,333
If you slip up,

373
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,875
all of the ninety-nine
Kishin souls

374
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,916
the two of you have collected
so far will be confiscated.

375
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All of them will be confiscated.

376
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,583
All... confiscated.

377
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,833
[Maka]
So that means...

378
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,500
We failed?!

379
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,791
[Soul] Damn it...
damn it... damn it.

380
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,166
We have to start all over.

381
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,083
As the meister,
I'll take responsibility okay?

382
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,375
Aw, man! And I was this

383
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,625
close to being the coolest
guy in the academy!

384
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,416
He just ate your soul,
you damn cat.

385
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,958
What are you
still doing up there?!

386
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,708
You aren't very smart,
are you little girlie?

387
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,041
Don't you know that
all cats have nine souls?

388
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,458
So, Soul...

389
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,958
When are you gonna leave
this dumb girl for me anyway?

390
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,166
Blair go away...!

391
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,875
Stop following us, will ya?!

392
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:52,291
[Blair] Come on Soul...
you know you want to.

393
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,625
This situation
isn't cool at all.

394
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,791
[Narrator] The boy's name...

395
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,500
...is Black Star...
He is an assassin...

396
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,833
...shrouded in darkness.

397
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,250
With his partner,

398
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,708
he stalks his enemies
from the shadows.

399
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,333
[Black Star] Tsubaki... the head
of the table... he's the target?

400
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,583
[Tsubaki] Yes... We're
after Alcapone

401
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,125
along with his associates...

402
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,208
About a hundred souls in all.

403
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,375
[Black Star]
A hundred versus me...

404
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,791
What I like.

405
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,458
[Tsubaki]
Black Star...

406
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,208
Those are Kishin souls
down there-- ones who have

407
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,166
strayed out onto
the path of evil...

408
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,541
We have to reclaim them all.

409
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,833
[Narrator] Black Star...
He is the meister

410
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,208
who controls Tsubaki,
the magic Dark Arm...

411
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,250
But this powerful young
boy still has much to learn.

412
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,916
Let's go.

413
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,750
[Narrator]
Prologue Two...

414
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,791
Black Star... Coming soon...

415
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:56,333
♪ closing song ♪

416
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,583
[Maka]
And that's it...

417
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,083
That's the beginning
of Soul Eater...

418
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,375
I hope everyone liked it.

419
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,791
[Soul]
It wasn't cool.

420
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,166
[Maka] All right, Soul, when are
you gonna stop sulking?

421
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,500
[Soul] Fine... So, in the next
episode, you get to hear all

422
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,750
about an arrogant assassin and
his fights against a mob boss

423
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,083
and a samurai.

424
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,000
[Maka] Good. But we're not
gonna tell you any more.

425
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,375
It's not dinner time yet.

426
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,541
This is just a snack.

427
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,791
[Soul] What good
is a little snack?

428
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,875
[Maka] Well... it's tasty,
for one thing.

429
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,583
[Soul] On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

430
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,416
"I am the Star! ~The Big Man
is Showing Up Here?~"

431
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,791
[Maka] Watch it,
or I'll take your soul!
