1
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,160
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:47,370
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:50,165
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:55,795
After a long journey...

5
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,299
Crona and I had
finally reached Medusa.

6
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:02,802
Crona wanted to settle things
between himself and Medusa...

7
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,805
And I wanted to
bring Stein home.

8
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:09,100
Vector Arrow!

9
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:11,019
So, the battle began.

10
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:15,482
We had come with a plan in
mind for defeating Medusa.

11
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:19,944
Unfortunately...

12
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,238
...we realized she had a
few unexpected tricks

13
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,574
up her sleeve as well.

14
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:30,872
This is the end.
It's time you die!

15
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,598
Medusaaaa!!

16
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:53,645
♪ opening song ♪

17
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,735
Maka!

18
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,988
Stein!

19
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,325
I have you now, Medusa!

20
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,082
What took you so long...?

21
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,793
We almost died over here!

22
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,003
Crona...

23
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,715
I'm sorry...
But I'm here now.

24
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,051
Thank you.

25
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:50,011
Let's end this.

26
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:54,432
Hold on, Maka!

27
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,976
We can't injure the
body she's inhabiting...

28
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,521
We would be hurting a
little girl named Rachel too.

29
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:01,523
There's our deal as well.

30
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,442
Maybe you haven't heard,
but according to its terms,

31
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:07,946
no one from the DWMA
is allowed to hurt me.

32
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,906
Well, you know what?

33
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,283
I don't give a damn!

34
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:18,415
This little brat's
trying my patience.

35
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,500
Great...

36
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,752
...we still don't have
a plan, do we?

37
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:25,130
You know as well as I do...

38
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,925
We can't beat Medusa
if we hold anything back.

39
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,969
We'll get our chance
to go after her...

40
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,596
...but we have to wait
for a good opening...

41
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,723
It's not exactly cool...

42
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,933
...but that's the way it works.

43
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:40,270
Stop blabbering Soul.
You're not being helpful.

44
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:44,566
I'm not waiting anymore...
Let's kick her ass.

45
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,651
Um...

46
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,405
Yeah that would kinda
mess up the whole plan.

47
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,411
Anti-Magic Wavelength...

48
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:59,706
Fierce Attack, the
Anger-Filled Genie Hunter?

49
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,834
Maka's being
reckless at this point...

50
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,211
...but part of me
knows she's right.

51
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,047
We're up against
a strong witch...

52
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,300
...and the best weapon meister
the academy's ever seen...

53
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,345
It won't end well for us
if we drag out this fight.

54
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:15,764
Which means...

55
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:17,974
...we've got one choice...

56
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,976
We combine all our strength...

57
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,645
...and strike at her together.

58
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,401
Now...

59
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,863
...let's get this party started.

60
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:34,532
Crona...
Miss Marie.

61
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:37,827
Follow my lead.

62
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,047
Listen to Soul's song.

63
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:00,100
Let's go!
Soul Resonance!

64
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,817
I'll leave them to you, Stein.

65
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,360
Professor Stein...

66
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,487
Please step aside.

67
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,240
What's that noise
I'm hearing...?

68
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,909
And how do I make it go away?

69
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,498
It's completely broken...

70
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,834
You won't be able to repair it.

71
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,128
I have to.
It hurts my ears.

72
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,838
You could destroy it...

73
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:32,799
Then the noise would stop.

74
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:34,217
Destroy it?

75
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,677
That's right...

76
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,887
I said destroy.

77
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,597
Destroy it.

78
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,560
Destroy it!

79
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,649
Maka! Crona!

80
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,152
Maka...

81
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:53,528
...are you all right?

82
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,613
Yeah, more or less.

83
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,534
We deal with Stein first.

84
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:01,870
You two try to limit
his movements...

85
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,664
I'll handle the rest.

86
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,708
What are you going to do?

87
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,127
I'll have to think of something.

88
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,837
Look out!

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,894
So much noise.

90
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:28,772
Yahoo!

91
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:30,273
Which way, Tsubaki?

92
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:31,441
Straight on ahead.

93
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,151
Roger that!

94
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,277
But Black Star...

95
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,612
...be careful.

96
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:37,614
You can't charge in
there blindly...

97
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:39,824
There's bound to be a greater
concentration of the

98
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,618
enemy the closer you get.

99
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,536
More traps, too.

100
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:51,419
They think that'll stop me,
they're stupider than they look.

101
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,089
Over there!

102
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,809
Now!

103
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:11,731
(ah!) Miss Marie!

104
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:14,109
Noisy children.

105
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:22,951
Did you think you
stood a chance

106
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,704
against the academy's
best meister?

107
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,377
Professor Stein,
listen to me...!

108
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,962
You have to wake up...!

109
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,297
We need you now...!
Please, Professor...!

110
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,632
Come back!

111
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,301
Please, Professor Stein!

112
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,307
The noise won't go away.

113
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,394
It's meaningless static.
Nothing more than that...

114
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,980
Let's silence it, shall we?

115
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,700
Nosy little girl.

116
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,660
Say goodbye.

117
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,388
Crona!!

118
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,375
Crona!!

119
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,586
Crona!

120
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,588
Stay with me Crona!

121
00:09:58,672 --> 00:09:59,714
Crona!

122
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,383
Crona...!

123
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,884
Crona!

124
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:08,640
Great...

125
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,433
...now we're both dying.

126
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:12,352
And it's all because of you...

127
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,770
...idiot.

128
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:16,106
No, you'll be all right.

129
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,735
Ma...
Maka.

130
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,240
This is the end of the line.

131
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,325
We're really finished now...

132
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,078
You've been nothing but trouble
since we've known you...

133
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,830
You really suck.

134
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,998
Yeah, you suck...

135
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:38,420
...but at least you're here
with stupid Crona at the end.

136
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,174
Maka, please...

137
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:44,968
Don't cry.

138
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:46,011
I...

139
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm happy now
for the first time.

140
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:51,850
I finally am.

141
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,518
Because you...

142
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:57,147
...were my friend...
It's okay.

143
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:09,075
You really wrapped him
around your little finger, huh?

144
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,537
I never imagined
he'd throw away

145
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,540
his life to save
somebody else's.

146
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,380
Hey... Maka.

147
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:29,220
Medusa!!!

148
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,723
Aw...
Did I make you angry?

149
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,394
Stop, Maka!

150
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,688
Don't let your anger
take control of you...!

151
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,774
Maka...!

152
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,359
What the--?

153
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,738
Wasted breath.

154
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:51,493
You may as well give up...
She can't hear you right now.

155
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:52,369
Maka...

156
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,412
...you've got to listen to me!

157
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,789
Say something...!

158
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:56,664
Maka!!

159
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,876
No need to get so worked up.

160
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,713
Sit back and relax.
It'll be over soon.

161
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,760
Hang on to yourself, Maka.

162
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,680
You can't keep going like this.

163
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:14,224
We'll drown in the madness!

164
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,146
Her anger is consuming her.

165
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,732
She's completely lost control.

166
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:28,238
Get back...
now!!

167
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,033
Maka...

168
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,619
...stop this.

169
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:45,005
I've finally reached you.

170
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:47,757
Healing Wavelength.

171
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:56,391
Stein?

172
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,352
Who is that?

173
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,063
Whoever you are...

174
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,314
Please do something.

175
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:06,276
Stop this noise inside my head.

176
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:08,987
I can't do it.

177
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:13,575
Is destroying it the
only way...?

178
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,785
She said it couldn't be fixed...

179
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:19,748
What choice do I have?
It has to stop.

180
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:22,459
There's no need
to fix anything...

181
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,045
...or destroy it, either.

182
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:28,631
Just accept it as part of you.

183
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,056
It finally stopped.

184
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,143
Now try...

185
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,854
...try very hard to picture it.

186
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,398
...the place you're
supposed to be.

187
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,362
I know you can do it.

188
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,365
If you try.

189
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:17,764
Marie.

190
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,645
Welcome back, Stein...
You're home.

191
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,315
Vector Arrow.

192
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,234
Snap out of it!

193
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,321
Finally...

194
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,906
it's about damn time.

195
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:38,493
Sorry...
I'm back.

196
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,287
Seems I've caused you
a lot of trouble lately.

197
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,747
Yeah...

198
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,750
...thanks to you I've got a
whole new set of wrinkles.

199
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:50,672
Now that you're back...
maybe you can help us?

200
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:05,437
Well, Stein...
can you?

201
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,938
Yes...

202
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:09,691
Let's do it!

203
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:16,197
Please professor,
about Crona...

204
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,867
Calm down.
It's going to be all right.

205
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,118
It's faint...

206
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:23,163
...but I still feel the
presence of his soul.

207
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:27,417
I promise you...
I won't let Crona die here...

208
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,877
But right now...

209
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,172
...we need to concentrate
on Medusa, okay?

210
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,673
Right.

211
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:38,553
There are some friendships
that can never end.

212
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,223
It took me a long time
to figure that out...

213
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,559
...but I finally get it.

214
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:46,019
Well, Medusa...

215
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,854
...looks like the
tables have turned.

216
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:49,856
So it would seem...

217
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:52,192
Are you really serious
about killing me?

218
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:53,401
You bet we are.

219
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,528
What about the deal
I made with the Reaper?

220
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,280
The deal was conditional...

221
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:01,242
It doesn't apply if you seek
to betray the academy.

222
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,038
And what about this body...?
It still belongs to Rachel.

223
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:08,416
Here's the plan...
Use Resonance Link...

224
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,542
Can you do it?

225
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,044
--Yes!
--Yes!

226
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:13,630
Let's go!
Soul Resonance!

227
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:18,301
Resonance Link, go!

228
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:24,140
All right...
Can you hear me, Maka?

229
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:25,350
Yes.

230
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:28,103
Marie and I will
create a diversion.

231
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,397
We'll draw Medusa's
attention using the

232
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,607
threat of Marie's
Healing Wavelength...

233
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,109
Wait for your chance...

234
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,194
Then finish it with one blow.

235
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:37,195
But...

236
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,571
...how do I do that?

237
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,490
You need me to tell you?

238
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:43,451
You already know
the answer to that.

239
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:48,081
The strongest move you know...

240
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,834
The one you inherited
from your mother.

241
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,461
The technique that can
repel evil and purge

242
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,715
the darkness filling even
the most twisted soul...

243
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,425
The Genie Hunter.

244
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,595
Use that technique properly,

245
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,640
and you should be able
to defeat Medusa...

246
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,435
...without risking harm
to Rachel's body...

247
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,770
I'm counting on you.

248
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:12,147
Careful, Maka...

249
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,024
We don't want to
get reckless here...

250
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,402
The last time we managed
that move it was pure luck.

251
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,197
Even so, we'll try it.

252
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,825
Defeating her is
all that matters.

253
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,535
Vector Arrow!

254
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,788
Vector Plate!

255
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:31,958
Vector Storm!

256
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,168
Marie!

257
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:34,669
Right.

258
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:36,296
That's your big plan...?

259
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:39,674
You'll never drive me out of
this body using that old trick.

260
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,426
Don't be so sure.

261
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,971
No matter what special
wavelength you have...

262
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,557
...it only works
if you can hit me.

263
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,311
There's someone else here
with a special wavelength...

264
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:53,313
You should look behind you.

265
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:55,774
Medusa!!!

266
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,986
I won't show any mercy.

267
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,626
You don't deserve it.

268
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:17,420
She's using Genie Hunter!

269
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,341
Time to go.
Vector Plate!

270
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:24,219
Genie Hunter!

271
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:27,097
I told you, it doesn't
matter what you try--

272
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,111
I never knew that the Genie
Hunter had so much power...

273
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:43,863
But still, all you did
was drive me out.

274
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,782
You're wrong.

275
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:49,369
It's over.

276
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,870
What?

277
00:18:56,793 --> 00:18:57,961
Impossible!

278
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:01,965
Now you've seen Genie
Hunter's greatest power.

279
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:06,177
It's ability to destroy
any evil it touches.

280
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:09,139
How does it feel to
be beaten, Medusa?

281
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,310
A word of caution for you...

282
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:17,105
Genie Hunter may have
been enough to defeat me...

283
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:20,734
But it will never
win against the Kishin.

284
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,531
It's over.

285
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,245
The stab wound
Crona took is very deep...

286
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:35,248
...but he should make
a full recovery.

287
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,500
Crona.

288
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:42,922
What's that?

289
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:46,301
It's a postcard my
mother sent to me.

290
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:48,678
There's something written
on the corner of it...

291
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:51,181
...but I couldn't read it.

292
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,399
It says "Shujaat."

293
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,276
Huh?

294
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,152
What's that?

295
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,196
Kinda sounds like a spell.

296
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,369
"Bravery"...
that's how it translates.

297
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,748
Bravery?

298
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,127
An important word indeed.

299
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,755
Only seven letters...

300
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:26,508
But so many meanings behind it.

301
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,514
Yeah.

302
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,099
Stein and I should get going...

303
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:36,518
We'll head straight
back to the academy...

304
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,103
We need to
write up our reports...

305
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,688
...and see about these two.

306
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,773
What are you guys going to do?

307
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:44,359
That's easy...

308
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,778
We're going after the Kishin.

309
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,698
Yeah, that's what
I expected you to say...

310
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,908
Listen, Maka.

311
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:55,620
As long as Lord Death's soul
keeps him bound to Death City,

312
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,789
your Anti Magic Wavelength
could be the only

313
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,126
chance we'll have of
defeating the Kishin Asura.

314
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,546
Do you understand
what that means?

315
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,047
Yes.

316
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,720
Too bad, Lord Death...

317
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,389
It seems you don't
have enough soldiers left...

318
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:19,019
You'll never take Baba Yaga
Castle with that paltry force.

319
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,024
What the hell...?
What's happening out there?

320
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,275
Mosquito, sir...

321
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,235
...there's someone
closing in on the castle!

322
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,571
The traps are all activated,
but they're not stopping him.

323
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,948
He's still coming!

324
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,867
That's impossible!

325
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:42,542
So, you've come.

326
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:45,879
Why can't I find it?

327
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,089
Where is that damn castle?!

328
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,181
Good. Looks
like we've found it.

329
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:58,266
Yeah...
We have.

330
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:09,486
Here you are...
it's about time.

331
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,948
Sorry to keep
ya waiting, Mifune.

332
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,159
Right, now let's do this thing.

333
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:21,247
♪ closing song ♪

334
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,418
I'm finally back.

335
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,003
Isn't everyone glad to see me?

336
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,713
Before we get too excited,

337
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,798
we should make sure
you're the real Stein...

338
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:56,009
Please say 'suture'
ten times quickly.

339
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:57,010
All right...

340
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,219
...but let's hear
you do it first.

341
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:58,803
Huh?!

342
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,221
Well, Maka?

343
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,141
Suture, suture, suture,
suture, suture, suture,

344
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,226
suture, suture, suture, suture.

345
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,353
Impressive.

346
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,313
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

347
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:10,023
Warrior or Slaughterer...

348
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:12,609
Showdown:
Mifune vs. Black Star?

349
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,861
Suture, suture, shu...

350
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:16,196
Oh, that is hard.
