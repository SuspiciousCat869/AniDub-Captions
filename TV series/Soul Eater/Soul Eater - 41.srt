1
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:45,368
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:47,579
dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:50,373
and a sound body.

4
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:01,676
Hurry... You must hurry, Stein.

5
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,429
It's time to shed
your fake skin.

6
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:08,516
Give in and do
what must be done.

7
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:12,812
Look for the light.
The way out is up ahead.

8
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,106
Stop right there Stein.

9
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:19,486
Where do you think
you're going...?

10
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,197
You should be
locked in the laboratory.

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,783
That's what I'm doing:
trying to find my way back...

12
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:28,745
The fog is too thick...
and I think I've lost my way.

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,083
You have...
The madness is taking over.

14
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,294
I don't understand.
What're you talking about?

15
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:39,923
Haven't you
realized it yet, Stein?

16
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,884
I am the law's hound...
I guard this door so no one

17
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,512
with the taint of madness
can pass through.

18
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,932
You had better not
come any closer.

19
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:04,322
What's happening?

20
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:09,661
♪ opening music ♪

21
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,375
I wonder where everyone is.

22
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:42,962
They cancelled morning classes
since no one showed up.

23
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:44,714
That buncha cowards.

24
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:47,759
They're probably too afraid of
the madness to come outside...

25
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,053
I bet they're all at home right
now hiding under their beds

26
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:53,682
like babies... But
there's no need to be scared.

27
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:58,061
Not with me here... I'll tear
that Kishin apart in a second.

28
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:01,314
It'll take a whole second?
You're losing your edge.

29
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,399
Hi, Soul.

30
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:03,900
Yo.

31
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,822
You'll pee your pants
once you see the Kishin.

32
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,281
Oh, shut up.

33
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,700
Maka's not with you?

34
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:15,870
Nope, she isn't... She won't
be coming later, either.

35
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,747
She says she
can't concentrate...

36
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,917
She's too worried about Crona
and the nutty professor.

37
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,047
Hang in a little longer.

38
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,174
They let Medusa go,
didn't they...?

39
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:32,762
After that, what excuse can they
have for keeping you locked up?

40
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:36,391
Yeah... but what's going on
with Professor Stein...?

41
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,643
Has he come back yet?

42
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,313
Please tell me...
Don't you think

43
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,858
Professor Stein's disappearance
has something to do

44
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:47,152
with Lady Medusa?

45
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,324
It's possible. But you don't
need to be worried about that.

46
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:57,495
It's Professor Stein...
He's tougher than he looks...

47
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,581
He'll come back to us.

48
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,087
Call off the search? But why?

49
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:08,173
He's already left the city...

50
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,967
The way things are right now,
we can't afford to send

51
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,136
anyone else to look.

52
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:19,351
But it's so obvious what he's
doing. He's gone after Medusa.

53
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:22,062
If so, it's even
worse than we thought.

54
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,273
No one from the academy,
can so much as lay a finger

55
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,568
on that witch... Anyway,
I came to tell you we have

56
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:32,072
a Death Scythe mission for
you... Time to get it together

57
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,615
and come back to work.

58
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,868
Is that all you care about?!
You're not just a Death Scythe.

59
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:42,207
You were his partner too!
How can you give up so easily?!

60
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,417
He's been fighting
all this time.

61
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,545
Keeping the madness locked in.

62
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:55,887
Maybe he's stronger
than you think he is, Marie.

63
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:06,314
Impressive, Medusa...!
No witch has ever been able

64
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,776
to strike a bargain with
the Grim Reaper before.

65
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,946
It's so simple now...
All we do is sit and watch.

66
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,198
Arachne and the Reaper
will destroy each other,

67
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,742
and we won't have
to lift a finger.

68
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:21,413
Of course, if the plan
doesn't work... Both of them

69
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:25,458
will come looking for us...
That could get ugly real quick.

70
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:30,255
The Reaper won't break the
contract. He's too honorable.

71
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:33,174
And Arachne... Well, the
Kishin will destroy her if

72
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:36,136
the Reaper doesn't
get to her first.

73
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:39,305
We just wait a little longer
to make our move.

74
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,975
Where are you off to this time?

75
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:46,980
I've got a little
appointment with my lover.

76
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,405
Twirl 'Round and 'Roundo~ A New
World in Which The Doc Dances?

77
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,127
Don't cry.

78
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:12,422
If you can make it
through this anguish...

79
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:15,800
Happiness will be
waiting on the other side.

80
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:21,765
No matter how lost you feel...
There's always a way out.

81
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:24,684
Are you little girls
lost in here too?

82
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,978
What do mean, "girls?"

83
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:31,900
It's just me...
I'm all alone with you.

84
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:36,613
Just you and me, and that's
okay! I came here to get you.

85
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:41,076
Come with me.
We'll follow the path...

86
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,454
Pretty soon, it'll lead
us right out of here.

87
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,673
Can't you see she's a witch?

88
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:06,309
You can't stay here
forever, you know.

89
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,896
You have somebody waiting
for you. It's time for you

90
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,817
to leave this place...
but be careful of the witch...

91
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,823
If you let the madness take you,
you'll never find the way out.

92
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,449
But how do I leave?

93
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,993
That's easy.
All you have to do

94
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:27,122
is think about where
you're supposed to be.

95
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:32,002
Where I'm supposed to be...
Who are you, kid?

96
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:41,553
Zero reaction to magic...
It is still as a stone.

97
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:45,432
Well I could use
my wavelength to activate it.

98
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:49,227
No... there's gotta be
some trick to it.

99
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,732
How am I supposed to think
straight when all I have

100
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,734
to drink is this awful coffee?

101
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,904
Now look what I've done! The
coffee's spilling everywhere.

102
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,784
What's that?

103
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,996
Way to go!
This is a breakthrough!

104
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,292
Crafty Eibon, hiding a secret
page right in the front cover!

105
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,502
It's the information
we're looking for.

106
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:17,172
To activate Brew,
we have to find the key...

107
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,507
It's another Magic Tool.

108
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,009
We should send someone
out immediately...

109
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:24,095
Kid can handle
the mission easily.

110
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:29,517
We're not exactly
on the best terms right now...

111
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,895
I don't know
if he'll take it on.

112
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:35,398
He's still suspicious about what
we're planning with the Tools?

113
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,692
Too much is going on for
him to be acting like

114
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:40,403
a petulant child.
You're his father.

115
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,447
Tell him he doesn't
have a choice...

116
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,784
There's one more thing...
We need someone else.

117
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:49,871
I'd like you to call
on Uncle Bob for assistance.

118
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:54,834
Um... yeah... Who's he again?

119
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,503
How could you forget...?!

120
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,255
He's the owner of
the coffee shop nearby!

121
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,841
"The only coffee so delicious
it'll make you want to dance!"

122
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,719
Come on everybody, sing with me!
I'm falling apart at the seams

123
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,764
without my Mandheling
coffee beans! Oh!

124
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,182
Mandolin?

125
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,101
Mandheling, man!

126
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:15,271
I can't concentrate without
Uncle Bob's Rumba coffee...

127
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:18,149
I should have found that
secret page long before now...

128
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:22,112
If I keep going like this,
my work will continue to suffer!

129
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,322
Now, now, is it really that bad?

130
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:25,740
Yes...

131
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:29,035
Normally I'd never pause
to ask for outside help.

132
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,079
Paws?

133
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,795
It smells so good
I'm almost drooling!

134
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,090
Keep your pants on.

135
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,217
Lunch will be ready
in just a few more minutes.

136
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,344
You're calling this plate
of charred fish lunch...?

137
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,847
Besides isn't it Maka's turn
to cook today, anyway...?

138
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,432
Where is she?!

139
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,934
She locked herself in her room
and she refuses to come out...

140
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:54,811
She should really eat
some lunch, though...

141
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:58,106
I'm sure a bite of my yummy
fish would cheer her up.

142
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:01,443
Soul, give me a hand.

143
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,487
How about you be
my taste tester?

144
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,532
Here. Open up and say 'ahh'!

145
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:10,577
Hey, what the hell?!

146
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:26,384
How could they let
her go like that?

147
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:32,015
After everything she's done...
to Professor Stein... and Crona.

148
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,852
I have to stop...

149
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:39,689
If I keep thinking about it,
I'm gonna go mad too.

150
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,319
Mail for you.

151
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,534
A postcard from Mama!

152
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:14,265
The place where
I'm supposed to be, huh?

153
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:31,574
Come back here, Stein!

154
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:40,166
The laboratory?

155
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:45,130
It's a good thing I'm home
now, but I still violated

156
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:48,133
my curfew and ran off
without telling anyone...

157
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:51,052
I wonder what excuse
I should use.

158
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,729
Marie!

159
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,450
What're you doing, Marie?!

160
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:17,162
From up here...
the city looks so small.

161
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:21,958
Kind of like a prison floating
in the clouds, don't you think?

162
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,293
Somewhere out there...

163
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:26,504
I'm sure there's a world
that will fit you better.

164
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,423
Goodbye, Stein.

165
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:29,924
Marie!!

166
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,848
Aww... looks like she died.

167
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:39,559
But wait, isn't that
what you wanted?

168
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,356
You never cared about her
the way she cared about you.

169
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:47,942
Bye, Marie.

170
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:54,074
You went through
the wrong exit.

171
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:57,494
The madness has taken over
just like I thought it would.

172
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,371
What happened to Marie?

173
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:00,747
No need to worry.

174
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,041
You'll forget everything
once I'm done with you...

175
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:07,337
Everyone you knew in your old
life... even your own name.

176
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,173
What are you going to do to me?

177
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,424
You have to be punished.

178
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,260
You broke the law
and gave into madness.

179
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:17,555
I need to cut you open
and fix you up.

180
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:22,102
Stop it! No, don't!

181
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,483
So many pretty pictures!

182
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,778
Mama sent one to me every time
she went somewhere new.

183
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,571
She hasn't sent one
in a long time...

184
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,782
I've been kind of
worried about her.

185
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,493
Your mom must be
a pretty amazing lady.

186
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:43,915
A minute ago you were depressed,
but now you're all smiley!

187
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,129
Yeah.

188
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:52,966
So what place did she send you
a postcard from this time...?

189
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:56,553
Hey... Something's
written in the corner.

190
00:14:57,387 --> 00:15:00,015
You're right... What is it?

191
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,020
Hey Maka.

192
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,358
Teaching is nothing but trouble.

193
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,070
I never thought I'd do it...
But look at me now...

194
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,865
These kids need
someone to help them...

195
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,451
I don't think I can quit.

196
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,540
But you need me too,
Stein... Don't you?

197
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:32,714
Stop it... The kids
can't see you like this.

198
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,397
Don't fight it, Stein.

199
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,025
I'm giving you the
chance to be reborn...

200
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:54,194
Let me cut you open.

201
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:56,279
Yes, a new world is waiting.

202
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:58,698
It's time for you
to shed your fake skin.

203
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:01,951
Shut up!
Shut up...! Shut up!!

204
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,455
This is the fruit of life.

205
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:09,125
One bite of this and all your
suffering will come to an end.

206
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,796
You'll feel much better.

207
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,428
Don't fall for it.

208
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,724
You were reaching
for a shadow...

209
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:27,352
An illusion you created.

210
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,567
You. I know you. You're me.

211
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:38,113
I know you're nervous,
but there's no reason to be...

212
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:41,324
Go on... have
a sip of your tea.

213
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,159
--Um... uh...
--Oh no.

214
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,412
Don't tell me you're
a coffee drinker, too.

215
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:49,207
I don't think I can handle any
more Tango or Rumba or whatever.

216
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,252
I want to make a request.

217
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:54,963
Please sir...

218
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:58,341
Please let me leave here
and go after Lady Medusa...

219
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,553
I wanna to try and bring
back Professor Stein!

220
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:08,977
You're still being held prisoner
for your betrayal of the DWMA...

221
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,063
...and you want me to trust you?

222
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:15,817
I have to go after them.
Maka's always stood up for me.

223
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,946
I owe her that much...
I have to do this.

224
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:22,407
Okay.

225
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:25,702
You have some things to
settle with Medusa as well...

226
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:27,287
...don't you?

227
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,413
Yes.

228
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:31,708
My... you've got guts,
don't you?

229
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,918
M-- Miss Marie!

230
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,587
I asked her to meet us here.

231
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,798
She says she wants to talk
to you about something.

232
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,343
I am so sorry...
This is all my fault...

233
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:45,180
I lied to you... and...
now Professor Stein's gone.

234
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:49,476
Don't apologize.
Lift up your head.

235
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,398
I'm not ready to hear
apologies from you yet...

236
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:59,527
Maybe someday, but not now.
As for Stein...

237
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,405
He's too important
to be entrusted to you.

238
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:06,451
Not alone...
That's why... I'm coming.

239
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:11,664
Just then... When I
went through that door...

240
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:14,292
I was lost for a moment.

241
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,711
I wasn't sure if
that's where you meant...

242
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,631
The place I'm supposed to be.

243
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:22,092
Weren't you satisfied
with your life?

244
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:26,554
Yes, I was... Even in a world
governed by morality,

245
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,891
I made it a long time
without feeling guilt.

246
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,518
But now...

247
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,436
But now what?

248
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:39,150
You finally feel guilt,
but you don't understand why.

249
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,821
Because instead of fulfilling
your own desires...

250
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,740
...you found something
more important.

251
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,620
You already know
the right choice.

252
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:52,706
You just have to make it.

253
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,251
That's why you
called me, isn't it?

254
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,380
Open the right door
and walk through it...

255
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:04,175
The world you seek
is waiting for you.

256
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:06,928
The world that I'm seeking...

257
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,560
There's always a way out.

258
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:17,063
The place I'm supposed to be.

259
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,156
Oh yeah!

260
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:30,326
Damn it...! You only made
that shot 'cause I let you!

261
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,038
Well, you'd better not go
so easy on me this time.

262
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,831
'Cause the person
who makes this shot...

263
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:36,332
...is the one
who beats the Kishin.

264
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,834
What?!

265
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,837
Crap.

266
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,465
You idiot.

267
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,924
Come on.

268
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:46,760
With all that's going on,
this is what they're doing?

269
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:49,888
I think it's okay... Sometimes
you have to take a break.

270
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,890
Not you too, Tsubaki!

271
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:53,933
Maka! Catch!

272
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:55,143
Would you quit it...?

273
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:57,312
You know I'm no good
at this game, Soul!

274
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,190
Here... You go play.

275
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:01,274
Thanks, Maka...

276
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,234
Now I'm the one
who'll beat the Kishin.

277
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,987
How could you betray me
like this, Tsubaki?!

278
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,572
Aw, you'll be okay.

279
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,824
Does it really matter
who beats him?

280
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,161
Who cares, as long as
he's destroyed... Right?

281
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,163
Then we can play in peace.

282
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:19,334
Don't space out on us, Maka.

283
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,963
Hand over the ball, little girl!

284
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,051
Take... Thiiiis!

285
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,605
Hey, it went in.

286
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,694
See that...? I got the ball
in just by using my head.

287
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,903
Uh...

288
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,405
So clearly, I'm the
one who's gonna pound

289
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,031
the Kishin into dust.

290
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,826
Um, I think something's
wrong with your neck.

291
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,454
You're playing basketball...?
Right now?

292
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,415
Oh, hey, Kid.

293
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,959
You skipped school again,
didn't you...?

294
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,877
What're you up to, anyway?

295
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,796
I came to tell you
all something.

296
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,841
Do you know where we got
our information about

297
00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:10,218
the Kishin...? From Medusa.

298
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:13,513
They made a deal with her?

299
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,056
Exactly...

300
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,684
They released her because she
told them Asura's location.

301
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,396
They took a witch's
word just like that.

302
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,274
Even if it meant
risking students' lives.

303
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:27,652
I don't understand
what they're doing...

304
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,154
From now on...

305
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:32,991
We have to be careful about
who at the academy we trust.

306
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:38,038
Hurry. Hurry...

307
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:42,667
It's time to shed your fake
skin... Stop fighting it.

308
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:46,671
Just keep walking...
Don't you see that light?

309
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,840
You're almost there.

310
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:59,517
Is this it...? My exit?

311
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:22,457
♪ closing song ♪

312
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:50,503
What's going on...?
It's kind of like... you know...

313
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:52,839
I agree. It's very...
"you know."

314
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:54,090
So what do you know?

315
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,675
Oh, you know... "You know."

316
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,428
Oh, I know... But do you?

317
00:23:58,511 --> 00:23:59,512
I definitely know.

318
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:02,265
But I don't know
if you know, you know?

319
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,351
I'm lost. What're we
talking about?

320
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,353
Um... I don't know.

321
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,229
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

322
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,981
Charge Baba Yaga's Castle...!

323
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,983
Things are Kind of Gloomy?

324
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:15,445
Watch it... or I'll take
your soul...! You know...
