161
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,425
Now get out of my sight.

162
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:26,593
[MAKA gasps]

163
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,094
How can you say that...?

164
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:30,889
Black Star is the one who's
holding us up, it's not me!

165
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:33,391
He's always
so infuriatingly cocky!

166
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:34,893
[STEIN]
Let me get something straight.

167
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:37,187
What you're asking is that
Black Star hold himself back.

168
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,438
Is that correct?

169
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,190
Don't you see
that's counterproductive?

170
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:43,526
Who do you think is the most
powerful attacker on your team?

171
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,990
Why is everything,
all about Black Star?

172
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,785
You seem to have misunderstood
serial soul resonance

173
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,204
somewhere along the line...

174
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:58,583
You need to consider it
on a more fundamental level.

175
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:02,671
If you can't do this,
you will leave my class.

176
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:06,633
[MAKA]
I'll do it.

177
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:07,967
Oh?

178
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,970
[MAKA] I'm going to stay
in your class, Professor.

179
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,770
I wish I could say the same...

180
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,730
But things are changing.

181
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:24,984
How much longer will I
be able to teach properly?

182
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,823
Where did Maka run off to?

183
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:31,616
We've got work to do.

184
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,416
[SOUL] Maka...

185
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:42,460
[BLACK STAR] You went and whined
about me to the professor?

186
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:48,216
Looks like I'm not the only
one who's selfish, huh?

187
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,884
[MAKA] You...!

188
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,678
[MAKA gasps]

189
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:53,054
[MAKA yelps]

190
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,973
I guess that's about all
we have in common, though...

191
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,183
I'm not some little
weakling like you.

192
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:00,437
Cut it out you two.
This is getting us no--

193
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,647
[SOUL]
Let them handle it.

194
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,024
[KID] Fine.

195
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,150
[MAKA yells]

196
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:11,781
[BLACK STAR]
You satisfied yet?

197
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:16,286
It doesn't matter to
me if it is you, Maka...

198
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,580
If you take this
one step further...

199
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,541
I'll consider
it an official fight.

200
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:24,085
I'll hold nothing back.
I will crush you.

201
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,378
[MAKA gasps]

202
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:50,028
[MAKA]
You bastard!

203
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,823
[MAKA sobs]

204
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:58,286
[MAKA screams]

205
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,497
[OX] I guess things
aren't going well.

206
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,041
[BLACK STAR grunts]

207
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:10,924
Sorry. I deserved that.
Will you help me?

208
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:12,342
Yep.

209
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:33,488
[TSUBAKI]
Hey, Maka... Can I sit?

210
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,370
[MAKA] Don't you get
tired of it, Tsubaki?

211
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:44,332
Having your life ruled
by Black Star's whims?

212
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,585
[TSUBAKI] Tell me... what do
you think about Black Star?

213
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,087
You can be honest.

214
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,964
[MAKA]
He drives me nuts.

215
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,259
[TSUBAKI LAUGHS SOFTLY]

216
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,594
I've never told
anyone before, but...

217
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:59,764
Black Star actually studies
for every test he takes...

218
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,850
I doubt he'll ever
admit to it, though.

219
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,978
What? Seriously? No way...!

220
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,647
But then why does
he always get zeroes?

221
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:08,565
[TSUBAKI LAUGHS]

222
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:11,026
[TSUBAKI]
I wonder too.

223
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,527
[MAKA]
That takes talent.

224
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,820
Studying and getting a zero

225
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:16,698
sounds harder than
getting a perfect score.

226
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,909
You don't even completely
understand him,

227
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:21,619
and you're his partner...

228
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,163
When you think about that,

229
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:26,541
how could I have any hope of
matching his soul wavelength?

230
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,502
[TSUBAKI]
I don't know...

231
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:32,672
You two have always
gotten along pretty well.

232
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,758
Besides... it's not
such a bad thing

233
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:38,428
if friends don't completely
understand each other, is it?

234
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,055
You're two different people...

235
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,806
so of course there'll
be bits of each other

236
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,350
that you don't get.

237
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,019
That doesn't make your
friendship any less real...

238
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,645
and don't you think
that friendship

239
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,898
is enough of a foundation?

240
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:55,862
Huh...!

241
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,200
You seem to have misunderstood
serial soul resonance

242
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,993
somewhere along the line...

243
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,622
You need to consider it
on a more fundamental level.

244
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,833
I do.

245
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,047
That's it... I've been so
worried about my own feelings

246
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,175
that I forgot about
what's really important.

247
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,679
I'm ready to go back.

248
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,850
Come on, Tsubaki!
Hurry...! Hurry!

249
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:31,648
[MAKA grunts]

250
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:35,026
[TSUBAKI] What happened?
You were so eager a second ago.

251
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,862
I know, but what am I supposed
to say when I get back?

252
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,656
[TSUBAKI] I'm sure this isn't
going to be the last time

253
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:43,076
the two of you fight, so I
wouldn't sweat it too much.

254
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,083
So what...? Did you come
here to laugh at me?

255
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,338
[SOUL]
No time now.

256
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:58,133
We can laugh when we
pass this damn test.

257
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,968
Everyone's waiting.

258
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,347
You know, honestly...

259
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:07,434
I know that I don't...

260
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:10,311
always say the nicest
things about Black Star.

261
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:13,815
But the truth is,
I'm often jealous of him.

262
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:16,943
I wish that I could be as
strong as he is somehow.

263
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,153
That's all.

264
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,248
Sorry! I was holding us back.

265
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,420
[BLACK STAR]
All right!

266
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:37,839
Let's get this party started!

267
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,758
[LIZ and PATTY laugh]

268
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,344
[BLACK STAR] What, are you
just gonna stand there, Maka?

269
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,929
[MAKA] Right!

270
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,601
[MAKA]
Okay...! Let's do this!

271
00:17:58,735 --> 00:17:59,819
[MAKA]
From here on out,

272
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,988
we're entrusting our
lives to each other.

273
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,866
We have to do our best
to fulfill that trust.

274
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,840
[MAKA]
I can feel them now...

275
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:22,926
Both of their soul
wavelengths...

276
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,844
They're so powerful.

277
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:47,867
[LI'L DEMON] Hey, Soul!

278
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,744
You can hear it, can't you?

279
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,789
Their soul wavelengths
moving rhythmically together.

280
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,792
Almost sounds like a song.

281
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,669
[SOUL] Heh...

282
00:18:57,752 --> 00:18:59,838
[LI'L DEMON]
Let me help you.

283
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:05,510
Play the piano. Add your
soul's song to theirs.

284
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:08,680
Then resonance will be easy.

285
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,849
You're a greedy
demon, aren't you?

286
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,647
I think it's time
for you to shut up...

287
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,275
I'm doing just fine
on my own now.

288
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,111
[tapping]

289
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,500
[MAKA] I don't need to force
myself to understand them.

290
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:40,837
I just need to
accept who they are...

291
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,589
And believe.

292
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:50,764
People who are alike
couldn't make this harmony...

293
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:54,392
The secret lies
in our differences.

294
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:58,521
It's still a rough attempt,
but... you all pass.

295
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,941
This team's leader is...

296
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:08,156
...Maka.

297
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,455
[relieved sighs]

298
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:16,581
[KID] Well, we finally
settled that problem.

299
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,375
[PATTY] It's so awesome
you guys passed!

300
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,210
[TSUBAKI] I knew
everything would work out.

301
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,796
[BLACK STAR]
It was looking a little rough
when Maka started crying.

302
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,590
[LIZ] Women are more sensitive
than men, Black Star.

303
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,676
Yelling, not crying, thank you!

304
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,595
Why would I cry?
Do I look like a baby?

305
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,474
But there's one other
thing, Black Star.

306
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,979
I think that you
should hit me.

307
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,065
But... but why, Maka?

308
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:44,818
I hit you earlier.
This'll be payback.

309
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:49,322
Right.

310
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:52,117
You cannot be
serious, Black Star!

311
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,785
I'm not going to hold back.

312
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,496
Good. It wouldn't mean
anything if you did.

313
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:58,748
Come on. Or are you
afraid to hit a girl?

314
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:01,376
Do you realize who
you're talking to?

315
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,631
[BLACK STAR]
I hope you're ready for this.

316
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,884
[MAKA yelps]

317
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,846

Come on now... You could've
held back a little.

00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:19,519
Aw, dude that was
totally uncool.

Oh, oww...

Listen carefully!

The DWMA will not have it!

326
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:54,054
We can undoubtedly expect
the enemy to attack in force,

327
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:57,098
armed with Death
Scythes. However...

328
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,059
Brew will not make
things easy for them.

329
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:00,852
Of that we can be sure.

330

Well it's about time.

00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:05,106
All this waiting has
nearly driven me crazy.

that doesn't hurt?

The Battle for Brew.

Watch it... or I'll
