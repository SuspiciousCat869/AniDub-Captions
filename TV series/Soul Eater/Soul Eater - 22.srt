1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,041
[Maka]
A sound soul...

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,333
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,083
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,375
It's okay, really...

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,666
I promise you.

6
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:44,500
It's not that you don't know
how to deal with people...

7
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:49,000
It's that no one ever took
the time to deal with you.

8
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,333
What do you say?

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,791
Will you let me
be your friend, Crona...

10
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,541
Please say you will.

11
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,875
[Soul] You can't succeed without
the madness, huh...? Hah!

12
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,250
How does it feel to
have been so wrong...?

13
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,250
Maybe you should take
up a different hobby...

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,000
The music thing
doesn't really suit you.

15
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,833
[door groans and
shuts with echo]

16
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,083
[Demon]
Oh... He left.

17
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,791
Oh well, that's all right...

18
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,916
The door will
always be unlocked.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,041
But still...

20
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,541
...what his girlie
did back there...

21
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,833
Was it really an
exorcism wavelength?

22
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:55,541
♪ opening song ♪

23
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,000
The black blood has
been stopped somehow.

24
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,000
The fight between Maka
and the Demon Sword at the

25
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,791
second barrier has ended...

26
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,125
I can feel both of their
souls beginning to relax now.

27
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,458
And Maka...?

28
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,291
Is my darling daughter alright?

29
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,541
She is...

30
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,125
It looks like she was
able to grasp on to the

31
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,875
Demon Sword's
wavelength somehow...

32
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,625
The sword meister's
wavelength is stabilizing.

33
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,416
[Crona] I've never cried this
much before in my life.

34
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
How am I supposed
to deal with my tears...?

35
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,833
There're so many of them.

36
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,958
[Soul] Maka, we're
running out of time.

37
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,583
We need to get moving.

38
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,250
But we can't just
leave him like this.

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,583
He's a wreck.

40
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,416
Just our luck.

41
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,166
[Ragnarok]
Screw you guys.

42
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,958
[Ragnarok]
Damn you, little girl!

43
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,666
You're tiny!

44
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,916
[Ragnarok]
What the hell did you do?!

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,041
Why am I so little now?

46
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,250
[Crona muffled]
Hey, get off me...!

47
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,375
How should I know?!

48
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,291
Let go of her!

49
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,250
[Ragnarok]
You and Crona...?

50
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,000
Friends...?

51
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,666
You gotta be kidding me!

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,916
Who'd wanna be friends with
a pathetic thing like him...?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,166
He isn't even any fun.

54
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,750
[Crona]
Quit it... get off!

55
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,000
[Ragnarok]
Wait, I got it!

56
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,875
You wanna keep him around
as a punching bag!

57
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,958
Bullying him is an excellent
way to reduce stress.

58
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,833
That's what you want him for!

59
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,458
Get goin' ya little freak.

60
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,666
[Ragnarok]
Well, too bad.

61
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,791
I'm the only one who
gets to beat up Crona.

62
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,208
[Ragnarok] He's mine!
You can't have him.

63
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,041
Please get offa me...

64
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,083
I said, get off now!

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,875
[Ragnarok screams]

66
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,833
[Ragnarok] How could you
punch me, Crona...?

67
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,250
I don't believe it...

68
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,250
Do you know how it
feels to be hit by you?!

69
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,541
No. How could I?

70
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,916
[Ragnarok]
Well, I'll tell you...!

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,125
It's like when you
haven't crapped

72
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,625
in three days and
three nights...

73
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,958
and then you get a
toilet-water splash back bonus

74
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,583
when you unload it all.

75
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,750
[Crona] That's gross,
and I don't get the comparison.

76
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,000
[Ragnarok] You think I'm gonna
let you talk to me like that?

77
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,750
You guys go ahead without me...

78
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,583
I can handle things back here.

79
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,750
I can hold him off.

80
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,083
I won't let him through.

81
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,625
Here we go!

82
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,458
--Whatcha got under there, huh?
--Hey pervert, let go of me!

83
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,791
Nice dress, pansy.

84
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,250
Don't try to fight back.
You're pathetic.

85
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,333
Oh...kay...

86
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,500
Sure thing. We'll just
leave it to you.

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,875
Get him off! Somebody help me!

88
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,875
Try not to die.

89
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,791
[Maka]
The Seal Shrine...

90
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,125
The Immortal Man's Tricks?

91
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,791
[Maka] I wonder if
the others caught up

92
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,875
with the ones who
had the black blood.

93
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,708
[Soul] Are your
wounds healing okay?

94
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,250
Some black scabs have
stopped the bleeding.

95
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,291
I think they're from the

96
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,708
black blood
that was inside me...

97
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,916
They formed when it disappeared.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,041
That makes sense.

99
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,208
But what made the

100
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,583
black blood go away
in the first place?

101
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,750
Huh... good question.

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,791
[Soul] Anyway,
we need to stop them

103
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,458
from injecting the
blood into the Kishin.

104
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,333
Kid and Black Star
are after them...

105
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's catch up.

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,000
It looks like Kid and
the others went this way.

107
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,958
I hope nothing's
happened to them.

108
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,541
Damn...! Can't he at least leave
something for me to do here...?!

109
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,416
How am I supposed
to stand out now?!

110
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,666
[Tsubaki] Shouting a lot is a
good way to stand out!

111
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,000
Now let's hurry.

112
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:54,875
Right...!

113
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,083
I'm gonna make Kid eat my dust.

114
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,916
[Kid] This place
is a complete mess.

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,458
It hardly even looks
like a building anymore.

116
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,000
[Liz]
Don't get distracted.

117
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,791
You don't need to
focus on the mess...

118
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,208
Think about symmetrical
stuff instead.

119
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,875
Butterfly!

120
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,750
The number eight!

121
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,250
[Liz] What? Are you
having a reaction?

122
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,083
Not that.

123
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,625
I can sense the
Kishin's wavelength.

124
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,375
What is it Kid?

125
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,583
You sure you're okay?

126
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,583
Yeah...
It's just this pressure...

127
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,666
I've never sensed
anything like it before.

128
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,375
[Liz] The Kishin's
up ahead, right...?

129
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,750
And you can feel it...?

130
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,833
What's it like?

131
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,125
[Kid]
What's it like...?

132
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,416
That's not an easy
question to answer.

133
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,041
My father only explained
it to me briefly,

134
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,708
so I don't know very much.

135
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,166
Asura was one of my father's

136
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,291
guardians until
he became a Kishin.

137
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,208
Then my father defeated him
and tore off all his skin.

138
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,333
It sounds like your dad
used to be a pretty scary guy...

139
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,750
Why did he do that?

140
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,791
Because he needed to
make a bag to seal Asura in...

141
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,166
It had to be sturdy...

142
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,250
...strong...to lock up
Asura's soul and madness...

143
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,083
What better than
the man's own skin...?

144
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,208
It made the
perfect prison for a Kishin.

145
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,291
After removing all
of Asura's blood,

146
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,458
my father stuffed his
withered body along with

147
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,375
his ruined soul into the
bag and sealed it up tightly.

148
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,333
So now... Asura's body is
starving for blood.

149
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,416
[Liz] That's why they need to
feed him that black blood stuff?

150
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,458
Probably.

151
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,250
Kid, hey...!
There's a heat source!

152
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,375
Right up ahead!

153
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,833
What?!

154
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,208
Cannon fire...?

155
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,083
But from where?

156
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,958
Magic Eye Cannon!

157
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,916
So this is the immortal...

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,958
Damn it...
I was so distracted by

159
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,333
the Kishin that
I didn't notice him.

160
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,208
Aww, nice try.

161
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,916
[Kid] Impervious
to bullets, huh...?

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,416
In that case,
fighting him head on

163
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,541
would only be a
waste of my time... 

164
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,458
I'll have to find a way to
throw him off balance

165
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,083
and then rush past him
when I get the chance.

166
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,375
I've got the upper hand

167
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,000
when it comes
to mobility, though.

168
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,250
Once I get past him,
he'll never catch up.

169
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,708
You're not getting any further!

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,250
[Kid] Swiping at my feet!

171
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,416
He's gonna do whatever
he can to reduce my speed.

172
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,750
Missed me!

173
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,500
All right...

174
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,958
I'll try something else.

175
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,666
Go Soul Resonance...!

176
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,541
Execution Mode!

177
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,125
[Liz]
Resonance stable...

178
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,208
Noise level at one
point eight percent.

179
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,041
Feedback in four seconds.

180
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,041
Three.

181
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,583
[Patty]
Two.

182
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,958
One!

183
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,416
Ready to fire!

184
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,083
[Kid]
Death Cannon!

185
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,625
That should've done something.

186
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,791
What...?

187
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,000
Not even the Death
Cannon'll work on him?

188
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,875
This is not good.

189
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,375
[Kid]
What?!... not good.

190
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,500
I need to back up.

191
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,750
[Kid thinks]
Just as I expected.

192
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,875
He won't come after
me from there.

193
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,666
All he wants is to prevent
me from getting through...

194
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,791
If I try to force
my way past him,

195
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,416
he'll rip me to shreds.

196
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,083
Think harder...

197
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,625
I need to connect
these things...

198
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,458
...straighten them up.

199
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,333
Think harder...

200
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,208
Okay...! Yeah, I have it now.

201
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,041
That pillar and that pillar
used to be the top part

202
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,458
and bottom part of
a single pillar.

203
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,291
And that one over there
went in between the two of them.

204
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,333
Excellent...!

205
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,500
Now it all makes sense.

206
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,541
It connects beautifully,
just beautifully!

207
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,708
[Kid] No... that's not what I
need to be thinking about...

208
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,166
The mess doesn't bother me...

209
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,625
Okay... it does
bother me a little...

210
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,875
[Liz]
It's okay, Kid.

211
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,833
Just try to stay focused.

212
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,125
[Kid]
Yeah...

213
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,333
If it's some kind of puzzle

214
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,666
game you're playing,
I'll join you.

215
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,791
I love a good puzzle.

216
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,791
How dare you mock me!

217
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,291
[Kid] Damn it...
Where the hell are

218
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,708
the rest of the pieces
of that broken statue?

219
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,125
And what's up
with that thing...?

220
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,416
It looks like a bad dream you'd

221
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,208
have after eating
too late at night.

222
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,458
Shut up idiot! 

223
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,708
This is no time
for art criticism.

224
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,166
Get it together...

225
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,416
That pillar,
could it go over there?

226
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,583
Calm down!

227
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,375
Pillar... statue...
bad dream... top...

228
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,875
bottom, left, right, middle...

229
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,333
This doesn't look good.

230
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,291
I'm impressed Kid managed
to enter an area as messy as

231
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,375
this in the first place,

232
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,625
but he's losing it now...

233
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,958
If he doesn't stop this quickly,

234
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,541
he'll think about it so
much he'll go crazy.

235
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,166
Oh no! He's scratching his
head quicker and quicker...

236
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,375
That's not a good sign.

237
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,541
What now, Sis?

238
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,500
We've gotta do something!

239
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,000
[Kid panicking]

240
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,291
We need to get his mind
off it, but what do we do?

241
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,291
What do we do?!

242
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,666
Yahoo!

243
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,541
Sorry we didn't come sooner!

244
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,791
We caught up to you!

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,166
We, I mean, I win!

246
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,333
Too bad, so sad!

247
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,666
No evil Kishin reviving
for you after all!

248
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,083
How does that feel?

249
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,666
Moron...! It's me.

250
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,500
The one we want
is further ahead!

251
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,458
Really...?! That's not
good at all, man...

252
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,708
Wait... in that case,

253
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,166
what're you doing
standing around here then?

254
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,875
Uh-oh, not this guy!

255
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,333
Hey, good one, Black Star...

256
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,791
Now we can get his
focus back on the

257
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,625
werewolf where it belongs.

258
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,583
[Liz]
Kid...! Look!

259
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,833
That man has a ball and chain

260
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,333
on his left foot
but not on his right.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,708
So he does...

262
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,291
How disgusting.

263
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,833
Yeah!

264
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,958
Hey, werewolf...!

265
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,333
I don't let anybody
stand in my way...

266
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,833
Let's get moving, Tsubaki!

267
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:58,416
Right!

268
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,875
We'll back him.

269
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,708
Let's see you try.

270
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,041
This new runt
could be a problem.

271
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,541
Let's go...! Speed Star!

272
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,833
He's fast...! Where...?

273
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,625
Oh, crap!

274
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,083
Nin!

275
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,750
Why, you...

276
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,125
I've got more.

277
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,166
What's up with this kid?

278
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,625
[Kid thinks]
Hold on...

279
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,500
There's something strange
going on with this guy...

280
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,750
He never even tried
to dodge my attacks...

281
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,833
...but he's doing whatever
he can to avoid Black Star's...

282
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,500
Why is that?

283
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,666
Oh...!

284
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,666
Now I see, he tricked us.

285
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,958
What'd'you say?

286
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,208
What're you doing...?

287
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,416
You want me to tear you up?!

288
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,666
Into eight pieces,
if you don't mind...

289
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,458
Go right ahead,

290
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,250
I won't stop you...

291
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,708
Oh, wait--... 

292
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,041
In your current form,
you can't touch me can you?

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,750
Finally figured it out, did you?

294
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:10,708
Hey.

295
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,833
Hey!

296
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,458
Whoa!

297
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,875
[Kid] I take it this is a spell
cast by the Magic Eye...

298
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,958
Yeah... called
Forwarding Vision...

299
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,291
It's a type of Spatial Magic...

300
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,583
It displays a live image

301
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,333
of me while I'm
somewhere else entirely.

302
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,916
How dare you do that
on top of Tadpole Jackson...?!

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,750
You'll pay for this! You beast!

304
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,500
I didn't have any other choice.

305
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,541
This was the only way

306
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,208
we could delay them
and keep moving.

307
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,041
What gave me away?

308
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,458
You never tried to avoid any

309
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,625
of the bullets I shot
in your direction.

310
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,666
But... you didn't want any

311
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,916
of Black Star's blade
attacks to hit you...

312
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,041
because they would go

313
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,583
right through you
without resistance,

314
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,916
and we'd realize that you were
nothing more than an image. 

315
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,291
I assume the initial cannon

316
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,833
blast came from
behind the projection.

317
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,500
You had to make the image
look like the real deal.

318
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,000
The fact that people generally
prefer to attack immortals

319
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,500
from a distance worked
in your favor, too...

320
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,958
I'm sure you were
counting on that.

321
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,291
All in all, it was a nice trick.

322
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,458
What I wanna know is why

323
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,291
you didn't notice
when you stabbed him!

324
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,166
Hey...! I'm Black Star...

325
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,666
I figured my attacks were
so awesome that my blade

326
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,916
just slid right through
him without me feeling anything.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,041
Really...?!

328
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,625
So then what is
your excuse, Tsubaki?

329
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,208
I just figured he'd
improved a lot,

330
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,000
but I guess I was wrong...huh?

331
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,500
Oh, wow...

332
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,583
Weapons love blindly,
don't they?

333
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,958
Damn...!

334
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,833
They bought themselves a
lot of time with that trick.

335
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,500
Let's hurry, Black Star.

336
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Right!

337
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,250
Time for more action.

338
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,083
Those are good
students you have...

339
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,083
They did well, didn't they...?

340
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,333
They've completed almost
every single assignment that

341
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,333
you've given them today.

342
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,416
But you can sense
it too, can't you...?

343
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,333
It appears the Kishin's
madness has begun to overflow.

344
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,333
Here we go Spirit.
Are you ready?

345
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,791
Yeah!

346
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,500
It won't do you any good now.

347
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,291
Say, tell me something...

348
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,958
How <i>do</i> you raise a good child?

349
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,416
Oh no, Tadpole Jackson!

350
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,291
Aww...!

351
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,416
Are you okay, poor little baby.

352
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,416
Eruka, look at this.

353
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,875
What?

354
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,000
The Kishin must be
through those doors.

355
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,166
We're here.

356
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,416
We need to hurry...

357
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,375
Those little brats'll
catch up to us soon.

358
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,916

My face! I can't
do this anymore!

362
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm going home and hibernating!

Your face...?

364
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,083
What about your face?

365
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,125
Okay...
calm down now.

366
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,916
[Free]
I can't die. I'm immortal.

367

[Free]
What the hell am I doing?!

368
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,833
I-It was...an illusion?

369
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,166
This is the Kishin's madness?

370
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,291
It's not far off...

371
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,791
We're here.

[Stein] Let's finish this off
with one shot, Spirit.

374
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,750
[Death Scythe] Right... But how
do you plan to cook her goose?

375
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,208
[Stein] I'll start by rubbing it
with some fresh herbs and spices

376
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,708
and roasting it over
low heat for several hours...

377
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,583
Then I'll slice it up
and serve it with a crisp

378
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,541
arugula and spinach salad
and a tasty rice pilaf.

That's not what I meant!

Dead or Alive...!

In the Rift Between
Revival and Dazzlement?

Watch it...

[Stein]
And what's worse,

386
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,583
you'll miss out
on Professor Stein's

387
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,916
famous roasted duck.

388

[Death Scythe] I thought you
were cooking goose?
