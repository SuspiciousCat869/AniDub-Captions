1
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:30,395
A sound soul...

2
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,605
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,400
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:41,990
The battle against Arachnophobia
and the Kishin continues.

5
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:45,535
There is no hope for you now.

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:48,413
Black Star settled
his score with Mifune.

7
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:56,421
Dad was able to join the
battle by using Brew

8
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:59,674
to turn all of Death City
into a robot.

9
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:13,688
What now?!

10
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,607
No!

11
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,986
And finally...
We recaptured the Kishin.

12
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:22,280
Hmm.

13
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:27,369
♪ opening song ♪

14
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:11,014
I have to say...

15
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:14,351
...you're as reckless
now as you always were.

16
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:19,189
It's nice to see
you again, too, Asura.

17
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:23,193
This is one pleasure I would've
been more than happy to forgo.

18
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:28,156
The tension is palpable.

19
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,741
Even here, I feel too close

20
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:32,410
to the Kishin's
madness for comfort.

21
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:37,457
The Grim Reaper at his finest,
wielding a Death Scythe.

22
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,337
And Asura, the Kishin who has
already escaped once.

23
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,757
Which one will win this fight?

24
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,258
I'm sorry for the
inconvenience,

25
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:49,761
but there's no running
away this time...

26
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,472
You can't leave this room
without my permission,

27
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:55,308
which I don't intend
to give you.

28
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:57,185
You put me in
a difficult position...

29
00:03:57,268 --> 00:04:00,313
If you won't let me leave
I'll have to kill you.

30
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,524
Oh...?
Is that so...?

31
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:03,692
After all this time,

32
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,778
you actually believe
you can defeat me?

33
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,493
Unfortunately for you...

34
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,913
The moment you were swallowed
and trapped in my Death Room...

35
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,624
...the winner
was already decided.

36
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,253
Well...
what do you say...?

37
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,797
Shall we end this quickly?

38
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,507
It's starting...

39
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,926
The battle between gods.

40
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,182
Lord Death Wields
a Death Scythe...

41
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:39,227
Just One Step
from Utter Darkness?

42
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:47,652
Hey, Maka...

43
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,529
...what the hell's
going on out there?

44
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:51,322
Why's Death City moving...?

45
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:53,783
What happened to the Kishin?

46
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:57,537
Without even using my soul
perception, I can tell...

47
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,248
The Kishin is inside
the Death Room right now.

48
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,583
Seriously?

49
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,252
He's not alone...
Lord Death's there too.

50
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,795
So now what?

51
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,547
Let's keep moving.

52
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,424
Are we going to the Death Room?

53
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:11,760
The Kishin isn't
the only target.

54
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,011
There's still Arachne...

55
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,055
...and the Moral
Manipulation Machine...

56
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,849
Let's just do what we
can out here for now.

57
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,060
First, we have to meet
up with the others...

58
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:21,186
...sound good?

59
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:23,521
Yeah...
Let's do it.

60
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:36,743
Which way now?

61
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:37,952
From here, we go left.

62
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:39,496
Left? Okay.

63
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,581
Which way is left?!

64
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,249
Just take a deep
breath, Black Star...

65
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,127
Left is the side
you hold a fork on.

66
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:49,547
Kay!

67
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,591
No, come back here,
Black Star...!

68
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:54,511
Wrong way! That's the side
you hold a knife on.

69
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,848
I know that!

70
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes, naturally...

71
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:03,311
...of course
you knew, Black Star.

72
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,772
It didn't look like
he knew to me.

73
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,746
This is crazy...!
What's going on out there?

74
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,081
I don't understand this...

75
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,750
...neither one of them has
even made a move yet.

76
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,878
Look closely...
The fight's begun.

77
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,109
Nice try...

78
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,154
...but it looks like
the next move's mine.

79
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:56,990
What do you say, Spirit...?
You ready?

80
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,200
Whenever you are.

81
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:03,329
Then let's end this traitor...
He's lived long enough!

82
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,176
He did it!

83
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,677
Fools!

84
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:21,056
This doesn't look right...
It's a decoy!

85
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,557
Damn it!

86
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:46,748
Come on, Dad!

87
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,210
Is that the best you can manage?

88
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:56,883
Maybe you should've rested up a
bit more before taking me on!

89
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,176
Can you do me a favor...?

90
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,136
Stop talking in
that dumb voice...

91
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,138
It's incredibly annoying.

92
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,974
If it bothers you so much,
let me kill you quickly...

93
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,894
Don't worry...
I'll make it painless!

94
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:14,359
Why don't we have a little chat
about the past instead?

95
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,902
You see I've
had an awful lot

96
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:19,030
to think about ever
since you locked me up.

97
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,449
There was no escaping it...

98
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,910
When you're sealed inside
a bag of your own skin,

99
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,121
there's only so
much you can do...

100
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,289
Your mind starts to wander.

101
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,041
Yeah...
sorry about that...

102
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,502
It won't happen again...

103
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,922
This time you'll
be good and dead.

104
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:37,465
I know he's the lord of death,

105
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,969
but I've never heard him
sound so murderous before!

106
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,345
Sitting there in the dark...

107
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,806
I had the chance to
think about a lot of things...

108
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,684
...including the nature
of the world itself.

109
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,563
And after lengthy
consideration...

110
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,148
I realized something...

111
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:56,860
When all is said and done, this
world is an unknowable place.

112
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:01,740
On the surface, all
appears rational, orderly...

113
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:05,076
...but what lies beyond that
thin veneer of reason...?

114
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,786
Stability and reality...?

115
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,913
Or chaos and madness...?

116
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,249
What are we really
made of in the end...?

117
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:15,545
Is there truly any meaning
to the lives we lead?

118
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,465
Or are we nothing more
than hollow vessels...?

119
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,717
These are questions
we can never answer...

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,052
...because we cannot hope

121
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:25,805
to see beyond the world's
fragile layer of skin.

122
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,685
So we live our lives
filled with uncertainty...

123
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,146
...never knowing who
or what we truly are

124
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:35,231
or what the
future will bring...

125
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,525
All we can do is imagine.

126
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,028
Life becomes an
unsolvable mystery,

127
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,740
with any number of twists
and turns awaiting us.

128
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,534
And that's enough to
fill any soul with terror.

129
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,119
So much time to think,

130
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:49,954
and that's all you
could come up with...?

131
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,374
You really are pathetic!

132
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,586
Reaper Chop!

133
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,141
It's not necessarily
the uncertainty

134
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,643
that makes us fearful...

135
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:14,270
It's more than that.

136
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:17,399
The answers we imagine
are what really frighten us.

137
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,775
Let me get this straight...

138
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,777
You're saying people
would be happier

139
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,196
if they stopped
imagining altogether?

140
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,241
Imagination is where
all our fear originates...

141
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:30,370
It is the mother of terror...
and mankind's greatest weakness.

142
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:32,747
I always thought it was
humans' greatest strength...

143
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,625
...what separates
them from the animals.

144
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,169
What you offer
is order and authority...

145
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,464
Which gives humans the
illusion of security and peace.

146
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:45,093
But what truly lies under the
thin layer of rationality

147
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:48,638
you attempt to impose
on the world?

148
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,390
Who knows?

149
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:51,641
Exactly...

150
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:54,185
...maybe there's nothing
under there at all.

151
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,271
I think I've just
about had it with

152
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,523
listening to this
meaningless chatter.

153
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:00,442
Ready, Spirit?

154
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,235
Yeah, let's do it!

155
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,990
Let's go!
Soul Resonance!

156
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,913
Asura...!
Your time is up!

157
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:16,458
Is it?

158
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,376
Kishin Hunter!

159
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,569
You've lost an arm.

160
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,572
I'm not too worried about it...

161
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,116
It'll grow back quickly enough.

162
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:01,002
This fight of theirs...
is like nothing I've seen.

163
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,463
You think I wasn't
expecting that?

164
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:06,633
I know who I'm
dealing with here.

165
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:09,010
Pain in the present
can be dealt with...

166
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,639
It's imagining future pain
that hurts us the most...

167
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:15,308
It terrifies us.

168
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,143
So what?

169
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,938
Pain and death are not so
frightening, really...

170
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:23,274
Unless you let your imagination
run away with you.

171
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,068
Again, so what...?

172
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:28,238
Is there a point in all this
babbling of yours?

173
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,739
Naturally...

174
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,159
...would you like to hear it...?

175
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:35,954
Very well then.
It's quite simple.

176
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,497
See, Reaper...

177
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,166
I have decided not
to imagine anymore.

178
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,471
Uh... one request,
Black Star...

179
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,681
Huh?

180
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,307
What, Tsubaki?

181
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:58,476
Do you think we could
move a bit more quietly?

182
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,894
Why should we...?

183
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,105
Turning left and right
is making things difficult...

184
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:06,109
It's much easier to do things
my way and go straight forward.

185
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,610
Yes, okay...

186
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,946
...but if we make too much
noise, the enemy will find us.

187
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,117
Let them come...!
I'll take 'em down one by one!

188
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,039
Is this what he's always like?

189
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,498
Well, yeah, more or less...

190
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,000
That's Black Star for you...

191
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,794
He's an incredibly
straightforward kind of person.

192
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,509
It's you!

193
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:32,886
Yeah...!
It is me...!

194
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,929
The one and only Black Sta--

195
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:41,061
Got ya right in the balls.
One point for me!

196
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,063
Is that what she's always like?

197
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,773
Sorry about that...

198
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:47,734
She's a pretty
straightforward person, too.

199
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,743
I can't do anything about the
barrier the Reaper set up...

200
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:59,621
My castle is in ruins...

201
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:03,917
Must I now merely sit
here and quietly watch?

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,170
Lady Arachne...
The situation is serious.

203
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,381
You should escape while you can.

204
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:12,509
I will not...
I'm not going anywhere just yet.

205
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,803
But... my lady...

206
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,012
I'll wait for him...

207
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:19,474
Asura will return to
my embrace once again...

208
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:20,975
I'm certain.

209
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,230
That's what I have to believe.

210
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,608
So you've decided to
sacrifice your imagination...

211
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,277
...sounds like a cowardly move.

212
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:32,946
Cowardly, Reaper...?

213
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,241
I think you should choose
your words more carefully.

214
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:38,410
If there's a better word
to describe you...

215
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,079
I don't know what it might be.

216
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:46,376
This is how you've been as
long as I've known you.

217
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,172
Hiding cowardice behind cunning.

218
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:54,050
You were always riddled with
insecurities and plagued

219
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:58,972
by fears, unable to relax
until you'd hidden them all.

220
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:01,224
In an effort to escape
your own petty fear,

221
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,476
you partnered with Vajra.

222
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,562
You should have
fought alongside me,

223
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:08,064
but you were too weak for that.

224
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:15,280
In the end, you betrayed not
only innocent humans...

225
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:18,241
But your own
weapon partner as well.

226
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:24,080
You know, for a Grim Reaper...
you're impressively naive.

227
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:27,250
Following the rules doesn't
guarantee an escape from fear.

228
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,002
And insanity does?

229
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,629
Even if you bury your
fears in madness

230
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:34,299
new fears will only surface.

231
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,551
Are you truly so lost
already that you

232
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,429
can't understand
that simple fact?

233
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,931
If you continue along
the path you've chosen,

234
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:44,309
the world will sink
into despair.

235
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:48,063
Even a child would see
the heartless evil in that.

236
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:55,528
Don't you see how
empty and meaningless

237
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,322
the authority you impose is?

238
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:00,200
That's not how
the truth is found.

239
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:02,327
You make your followers
feel safe by offering

240
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,039
them white lies and
comforting words.

241
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:09,376
Don't you know that
only harms them more?

242
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,465
There's no hope for you.
You are beyond saving.

243
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:18,134
Do you find creating the
illusion of peace for people

244
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:20,220
that noble of a job?

245
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:24,349
It's far more noble than
seeking to destroy them

246
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:27,811
with blind insanity
like you intend to.

247
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,939
Have you been listening to a
word I've said, old man?!

248
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,985
What's wrong with
surrendering to madness...?

249
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,029
That's where the true peace is.

250
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,948
So you keep saying...

251
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:43,118
But that's because you're not
strong enough for sanity.

252
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,661
I'm plenty strong...

253
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:47,914
You'll find out soon enough that
you're the weak one, Reaper.

254
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,919
What's happening now, Kid?!

255
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:59,092
Hey, maybe it's time
to get outta here!

256
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,430
They're fighting with
so much power!

257
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:06,057
I was hoping I'd be
able to help Dad out...

258
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,977
...but that's impossible!

259
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,605
I'm a Death Scythe, but
this is beyond even my level...

260
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,068
Still, it's taking all my
willpower not to get involved.

261
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:21,197
It's about time
for us to end this.

262
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:23,950
Exactly what I was thinking...

263
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:27,245
Perhaps you should
say goodbye to your son.

264
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:32,083
What...?
Is it something I said?

265
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,628
I'll remove your
threat once and for all.

266
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,049
I'm the guardian
of this world...

267
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:42,552
It is my job to make sure you
do no further damage to it.

268
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,262
So I hear.

269
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,431
That's most
unfortunate, though...

270
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:49,559
I'd hoped we'd be able to come
to an understanding.

271
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:50,685
No...

272
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,688
...that was never
even a possibility.

273
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,231
We were friends once...

274
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:59,069
So allow me to offer you
one small piece of advice.

275
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,237
You should be careful about
hiding behind authority

276
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,199
and blinding yourself to the
realities of the world...

277
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:07,494
Might cost you
your life someday.

278
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,829
Or somebody else's.

279
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,280
Where's Dad?

280
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:48,660
Father...! Where are you?

281
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,498
Dad, no!

282
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:04,175
This is the destruction the
whole world will know.

283
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:08,013
It seems you've learned
a lot over the years...

284
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,181
...but tell me
something, Asura.

285
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:14,477
After you've filled the world to
the brim with your insanity...

286
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,396
...what else will remain?

287
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,481
Oh, it's you, Excalibur.

288
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,859
Don't worry...

289
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,360
Madness is enough...

290
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:25,655
The world doesn't
need anything else.

291
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:26,614
Fool!

292
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,117
Aw, I've missed you too,...

293
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,910
...but you're wrong.

294
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,538
I've won...

295
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,416
It was always going
to end this way.

296
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,169
Bound as he was by
honor and obligation,

297
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:42,505
it was almost too easy to
lead him into my trap.

298
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:43,715
Fool!

299
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,008
Those in power have

300
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,345
the responsibility
to maintain honor!

301
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:52,766
Exactly my point...
That's why the Reaper lost.

302
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,643
He was too weak...
a slave to his own honor...

303
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,105
He lost to me because of
his love for other people.

304
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,411
What the--?

305
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,414
No...
this is wrong...!

306
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,792
Very, very wrong.

307
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,794
I have to deal with
this immediately...

308
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:25,256
if it continues, I'll...
I can't waste time!

309
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,966
Where'd he go?

310
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,221
Huh?!

311
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:32,847
It's Asura!

312
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,766
He beat Lord Death...?

313
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,476
That's impossible!

314
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,032
Oh, Asura!

315
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:01,042
I always trusted you...!

316
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,836
I knew you'd return...

317
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,172
I knew you'd be
by my side again.

318
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:09,884
I've been so worried
about you this whole time.

319
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,553
You have?

320
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,054
Yes.

321
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:16,349
Arachne.

322
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,310
