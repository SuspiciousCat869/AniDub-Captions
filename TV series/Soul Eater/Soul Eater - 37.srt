1
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,311
A sound soul...

2
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:32,522
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:35,316
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,404
After sitting inside the
magnetic field for eight

5
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:42,282
hundred years, Eibon's
greatest tool, Brew,

6
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:44,576
has ceased to function.

7
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:49,622
And so, here we are... There is
no more time to fool around.

8
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:53,293
Fortunately, the DWMA
knows only that we have Brew,

9
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,338
not that it's no
longer operational.

10
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,590
Before they can recover
from their latest failure,

11
00:00:58,673 --> 00:01:02,344
we should move on to the
next step of our plan.

12
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:05,347
Wouldn't you agree, Mosquito?

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,891
Yes Lady Arachne,
I agree completely.

14
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,893
How is our research on
the Moral Manipulation

15
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:13,104
Machine progressing...?
Are we on schedule?

16
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,315
It's nearly complete.
We're entering the final stages

17
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:17,317
of research as we speak.

18
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:20,320
Faster than expected.

19
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:23,281
If we continue at this rate,
it should be ready very soon.

20
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,699
Yes.

21
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:30,288
(hah!)... What do we need
with some stupid machine?

22
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,707
Why not just leave the
academy agents to me?

23
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,875
I'll destroy 'em all.

24
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,543
Naturally, since you
did such a good job

25
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:38,296
of destroying them during
the battle on Lost Island.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,340
I pulled back my
forces assuming you

27
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:43,093
could handle your part of
the mission. Was I wrong?

28
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:44,678
You shouldn't presume
to comment on my

29
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,972
job performance. It could
be hazardous to your health.

30
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:49,933
What're you saying, old geezer?

31
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:51,935
Shall I spell it out for you?

32
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:56,773
Watch your mouth... or I'll
beat you to a bloody pulp.

33
00:01:56,856 --> 00:02:00,443
I'd like to see that.
Come on, try me.

34
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:10,286
Enough squabbling, you two.

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,623
Now, Mosquito...
continue with your report.

36
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:16,501
Yes. We've begun
installing stations at

37
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,378
various points
around the world...

38
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,006
Construction continues
swiftly and efficiently...

39
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,550
Everything is
proceeding as planned.

40
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,512
Good... now for the next step.

41
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,895
My darling children...
Go forth, complete

42
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,398
the task your mother
has given you.

43
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:45,697
At last... Arachnophobia finally
begins its rightful ascendancy.

44
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:52,537
♪ opening song ♪

45
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,377
And out of nowhere...
we were besieged by

46
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,588
hundreds of Arachnophobia's
most elite forces!

47
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:28,174
In the classroom,
I may seem quiet...

48
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:30,677
But in battle, all
of that changes.

49
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,928
I become a wild animal!

50
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,513
In the end, all we managed
to do was beat up

51
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:37,100
on some old man and send him
running back to Arachnophobia.

52
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,479
We don't even have
Brew to show for it.

53
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,067
Nothing can change our failure.

54
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,572
What happened?

55
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:57,537
Impossible!
That technique's too advanced!

56
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,707
What he said when I used it...

57
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,543
And that strange
blast of light...

58
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:08,757
Where did a move like that come
from and how did I use it...?

59
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,468
Is it connected to
Soul's playing?

60
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,229
All we did was survive
a small skirmish

61
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:27,359
against one of the enemy...
We gained absolutely nothing.

62
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:32,572
Maybe I should talk
to Lord Death about it.

63
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,163
Everybody looks
pretty depressed, huh?

64
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:43,458
It's not surprising... We risked
a lot going to that island

65
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,210
for a big fight,
and Arachnophobia

66
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:47,045
still ended up
with Brew anyway.

67
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:49,547
I know, but what's
so depressing about that?

68
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,467
Why don't you sit quietly and
think about it for a minute?

69
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,678
Okay, Sis, I'll try.

70
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,183
By the way, what's up with Kid?
I haven't seen him in a while.

71
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,726
He said he was going
to the bathroom

72
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,480
but now that you mention it,
he has been gone a long time.

73
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:08,233
What do you think he's
gotten himself into now?

74
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:16,950
The Detective's First Caseo~Kid
Exposes the DWMA's Secret?o~

75
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,875
What does the academy... no...

76
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,380
What does my father have
planned? What's he hiding?

77
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:33,425
He's begun gathering every
Magic Tool Eibon created.

78
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,427
He sent out the
academy troops to prevent

79
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,470
Brew from falling into
the wrong hands.

80
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:40,056
But he's not
telling us everything.

81
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,225
What are his true intentions...?

82
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:45,061
What information has
he been holding back?

83
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:49,315
I know there's more
to this than there seems.

84
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:53,069
Who is this Great Mage Eibon...?

85
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:56,406
What does he have to
do with my father?

86
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,283
I asked him about
it and, as expected,

87
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,995
he gave a half-answer
and then changed the subject.

88
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:10,712
If he won't tell me...
I'll find out for myself!

89
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:31,524
Anyway, like I was saying...

90
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:33,443
Something's been
bothering Kid lately.

91
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:36,821
He seems a bit suspicious
of your recent actions.

92
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,867
He's been poking around
for information on his own...

93
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,660
What should we do?

94
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:47,165
Poking around...
For information...?

95
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,793
For information, that's right.

96
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:53,880
Hmm... On his own...

97
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,216
Yes, on his own.

98
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,760
So... What should we do?

99
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,637
That's what I asked!

100
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,681
It's a difficult question.

101
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,891
None of us like
going into this blind.

102
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:06,101
Eh?

103
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:08,311
Kid's not the only one.
I want to know

104
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:10,689
what's going on, too...
Why are you collecting all of

105
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,775
Eibon's tools? Why haven't
you explained yourself to us...?

106
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,360
What's your plan?

107
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,195
You want to know my plan?

108
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,780
Yes, of course I do.

109
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,615
You want me to explain?

110
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,743
I want you to explain.
That's what I just said.

111
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,789
Too bad!
I'm not going to tell you.

112
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,083
How old are you? Eleven?!

113
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,379
Sid, Lord Death... Good morning!

114
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:39,009
Yo, Meister Maka...! Great to
see ya! How's it hanging?

115
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,511
Um... Lord Death...
There's something I

116
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,264
wanted to ask you about...
Is now a good time?

117
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:47,058
Of course, ask away...!
What do you want to know...?

118
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,019
I'll tell you a...ny... thing!

119
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,354
Hey now, can I get
some equality here?

120
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,316
A genie hunter technique?

121
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,486
Yes. The old man, Mosquito,
seemed surprised to

122
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,156
see me using it... I was
trying to do Witch Hunter,

123
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,241
and then this other
technique came out instead...

124
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:05,452
I don't understand it.
Are the two related?

125
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,788
Oh...! Our little miester
Maka has learned how

126
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:12,000
to use the Genie Hunter,
has she? Amazing!

127
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,710
Aw, it's not that big a deal.

128
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,046
They grow up so quickly...!

129
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,715
You're becoming more like
your mother every day!

130
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:19,966
Huh?

131
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,344
This new Genie Hunter
technique of yours...

132
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,888
I've only ever seen one
miester do it before you,

133
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:27,057
and that was your
mother, my dear.

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,267
Are you serious...? My mother?

135
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:33,188
Yup! As the name Genie Hunter
suggests, it's a special

136
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:36,691
move that works against
particularly evil forces...

137
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,070
Only a superior meister like
your mother could control it...

138
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,323
She truly was a talented
young woman, you know.

139
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:46,076
Who would have thought you'd
follow in her steps so quickly!

140
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,371
This is an amazing
achievement...! Congratulations!

141
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:51,998
If you continue improving at
this rate, who knows?

142
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:55,001
You may even be able
to defeat the Kishin.

143
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,003
I dunno about that...

144
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,506
I know this game...
When I was alive,

145
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,841
I, too, was very
adept at flattery.

146
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,677
But this isn't over yet...

147
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,763
We still have a long way to
go before victory is ours...

148
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:09,099
I expect you to
keep working hard!

149
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,475
Right!

150
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,644
See ya!

151
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,985
Following in my
mother's footsteps...

152
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:25,824
I never thought Maka's
abilities would awaken so soon.

153
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,200
This is incredible.

154
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:30,120
It's good news indeed...
With a little more progress,

155
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,830
the power to
annihilate the Kishin

156
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,541
may very well be in her hands.

157
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:36,793
Anyway, Sid, back to business.

158
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,211
Sir?

159
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:40,797
The package we spoke of...
has it been delivered yet?

160
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,257
Uh... what do you mean?

161
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,301
You remember. The package.
I believe I asked you to

162
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,221
locate a certain gentleman in
Oceania and bring him here?

163
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:51,558
Oh, I get it now! The package,
of course. It should be

164
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:53,143
delivered very soon, sir.

165
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,938
Indeed... That's good to hear.

166
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,565
Heedless of my own safety,

167
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,734
I plunged into the
magnetic field...

168
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:03,278
And then, there was
a great explosion!

169
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,864
The terror of it would have
made a lesser man weep!

170
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:08,700
Gimme a break! Like that's
really how it happened!

171
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:09,868
Eh?

172
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,245
Sit down and shut
your big lying mouth!

173
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,747
Okay...

174
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,667
Was the battle on Lost
Island really as

175
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,252
difficult as Ox says it was?

176
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:22,172
Yes... Skirmishes with
Arachnophobia broke

177
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,590
out all over the island.

178
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,925
He should shut up...
I don't know what he thinks

179
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,927
we have to be so proud of.

180
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,933
We failed, remember...?
Arachnophobia has Brew now...

181
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,019
We lost the fight that mattered.

182
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:40,231
Yeah, that's true, but it
could've been worse.

183
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,317
Your piano playing
was awesome, Soul!

184
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,361
Without that, who knows what
would have happened to us!

185
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:47,489
Yep. Look at it that way...
Everybody returned home

186
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,616
safe and sound...
We managed to get away

187
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:53,286
without anyone being hurt.
Surely that's more important.

188
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,415
Did we though...?
What about the Professor...?

189
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,417
I wonder how he's doing.

190
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,587
Do... do you
mean Professor Stein?

191
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:06,633
He collapsed suddenly while
we were on the island...

192
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,385
It was frightening.

193
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:10,804
He's probably at
home recovering today.

194
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,639
I hope it's nothing serious.

195
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:18,395
What's happening to him...?
Is it my fault?

196
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,398
If I hadn't planted that snake
in Miss Marie's coffee,

197
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:24,567
would Professor Stein
be okay still?

198
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:29,364
You look sick, Crona...
Is something wrong?

199
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,037
No, I'm fine...It's... nothing
to worry about, really...

200
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,622
Nothing, nothing at all...

201
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,000
He's kind of an
odd duck, isn't he?

202
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:46,756
Hey Crona...You should
eat... You're looking pale.

203
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,258
Yeah.

204
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,719
What should I do?

205
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,565
Okay... what's going on?

206
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:04,983
Just come with me.

207
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:06,985
Why should I...?
Where are we going?

208
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:08,194
Over there.

209
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:10,405
That's very specific, thanks.

210
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:11,865
Hurry up. We need to practice

211
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,658
it again before we
forget how it works.

212
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:14,951
What're you talking about?

213
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,953
That new technique.
Lord Death thinks we might

214
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,705
be able to use it
to beat the Kishin.

215
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:19,497
Huh?

216
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:21,124
So we need extra practice.

217
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:22,625
Huh?!

218
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:35,430
It's not there...
It's not there...

219
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,350
Don't you get it?
It's not there!

220
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,435
There... that's better now.

221
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:43,646
Excuse me, Professor Stein...
Are you feeling okay?

222
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,485
Feeling okay...? Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

223
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,155
Although, I suppose saying
that doesn't guarantee

224
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:54,949
everyone will
believe me, does it?

225
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,161
I want to ask you something.

226
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:03,958
What exactly does Brew do...?
Can you tell me?

227
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,337
You already know that Brew
is one of Eibon's Magic Tools...

228
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,673
He was a prominent
inventor and created many

229
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:11,174
impressive devices in his time.

230
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:13,677
But Brew is the most
powerful of them all.

231
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,804
True to its name, the tool's
magic promises all

232
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,890
the strength and danger
of a brewing thunderstorm...

233
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,017
The results of its
use can vary greatly

234
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,019
depending on the
person who wields it.

235
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,771
--Be more specific...
--There.

236
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:27,399
I want to know what the
tool actually does!

237
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,317
Is it there?

238
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,319
Tell me this, then...

239
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,947
What does my father plan
to do with Brew...?

240
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,200
What will the results be if he's
the one who uses it...?

241
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:39,661
If you aren't sure,
you can speculate.

242
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,789
As a professor,
you should have a guess.

243
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,586
What will you do
with the information?

244
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,423
I can see that you're impatient
for answers, but nothing I tell

245
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,508
you will be of any
use in the long run.

246
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,093
I can promise you that much...

247
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,804
Besides which, how could you
fully accept whatever I might

248
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:00,432
say while I'm in this condition?
Would that be a good idea?

249
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,766
Well I don't know...

250
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,810
I'm sure you're willing to
listen to my answers...

251
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:07,147
...that's the easy part.
But then what comes after that?

252
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,109
What do you intend to do after
you know all I have to tell?

253
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:16,614
Extra practices aren't cool at
all... That kinda thing is

254
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,325
only good for teachers' pets
and straight A students.

255
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,952
Well, I am a
straight A student.

256
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,413
Now would you
transform into a scythe?

257
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,833
Come on, Soul!

258
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,919
All right, all right... Quit
whining... I'm doing it.

259
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,302
You ready?

260
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:39,137
Just waiting on you.

261
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,809
Let's go Soul Resonance!

262
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,445
Genie Hunter!

263
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,155
Huh?

264
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:59,783
Hey, that isn't right.
This is Witch Hunter!

265
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,285
Why isn't it becoming
Genie Hunter?

266
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,506
Why didn't it work
right this time...?

267
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,384
Are you being lazy because you
don't feel like practicing?

268
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,469
Come off it, Maka. If
I was being lazy,

269
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,012
how could we have
done Witch Hunter?

270
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,057
Yeah, you have a point
there... But why then?

271
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,352
Maybe 'cause we're not even sure
how we did it the first time.

272
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:31,773
What's with the face? A new
technique always takes

273
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:36,486
a little while.... Isn't that
why we're practicing?

274
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:37,987
Yes.

275
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,075
Okay! Let's try it again!

276
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:43,785
Bring it on!

277
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,713
What is Arachne up to now?

278
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,507
She's sent those little spiders
of hers out everywhere...

279
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,843
They're all across the world.

280
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:02,012
She's up to something,
I'm sure of it...

281
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:05,098
Whatever her plan is,
it's starting to move forward.

282
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,934
Thank you for reporting in...
If there is any further news,

283
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:10,812
I would appreciate being
kept informed of the situation.

284
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,522
I'll let you know.

285
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,697
Things are moving along
exactly as I had hoped.

286
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,033
What else...? Have you
noticed any changes?

287
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:26,953
Uh... no... I haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary.

288
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:28,204
Well, have you at
least found out

289
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,873
the location of
the secret vault?

290
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:32,167
Oh yeah, that... not yet.

291
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,252
You should at least have
something by now!

292
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:38,214
Do you want to stay with your
pals at the academy or not?

293
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,007
It's just...

294
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,842
Ribbit?

295
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:41,968
This whole business with the

296
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,054
snake we planted
inside Miss Marie...

297
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:46,848
The snake...? What about it?

298
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,101
Something's happening... I think
it's hurting Professor Stein.

299
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:53,855
Oh...! Did I forget to tell
you? It's working well.

300
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,483
You did a very
good job with that.

301
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,778
We've got Brew now, and it's
all thanks to that little snake.

302
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,072
We've knocked one of the
academy's best meisters out

303
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:03,323
of the game, and we
didn't even have

304
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:05,658
to get involved in the battle.

305
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:09,496
It's my fault...I did this.

306
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,748
You're shivering. What's wrong?

307
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:14,084
N... no, I'm fine!

308
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,002
Good... Now you
should get going.

309
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,089
Don't you have more
work to see to?

310
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,299
Medusa's counting on you, Crona.

311
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,678
You wouldn't want
to let her down.

312
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:37,190
That's enough...
I don't think we

313
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,901
need to practice
any more today.

314
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:49,744
Come on, let's go back. Get up.

315
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,996
I don't understand.
Why can't we do it?

316
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,498
Who knows?

317
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:56,084
We did it before. Why not now?

318
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,212
We know it exists now.
That's what matters.

319
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:05,135
We did it once. It's bound to
happen again sooner or later...

320
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,178
Just not quite yet.

321
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,440
I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse...

322
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,775
Which reminds me it's your
turn to cook dinner tonight.

323
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,446
Uh, I forgot to shop...
We're out of food.

324
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,947
Why, you--!

325
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,742
Sorry! Looks like PBJ tonight!

326
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,369
You gotta be kidding me!

327
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:37,751
Right now, it doesn't matter
what I want... I can't ignore

328
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,253
something just because
I don't want to see it.

329
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:43,465
You can't turn a blind eye?
Not even for your own father?

330
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:46,092
I can't make exceptions.
Anyone who strays from the

331
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:49,012
right path must be stopped.

332
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,514
But who decides which
path is the right one...?

333
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,267
And how do you recognize when
someone has strayed from it?

334
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,394
It's simple...! The
truth is easy to see

335
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,937
when you know right from wrong!

336
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:02,901
Oh, is it really? You're
quite naive, aren't you?

337
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,110
About what?

338
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:05,737
Let me ask you this.

339
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,614
Where does this knowledge
of yours come from?

340
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,367
This ability to know
right and wrong?

341
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,744
There is no inherent
good or evil in the world.

342
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:17,207
Those labels are just artificial
constructs. Right and wrong

343
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,918
are determined by the people who
hold positions of authority.

344
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,629
That's the way it's always been.
So how, then, can anyone know

345
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:26,549
this 'truth' you speak
of? Don't you see?

346
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,426
The reality is, that
truth long ago

347
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,595
became nothing more than
a shadow of itself.

348
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,514
It's a mere echo
of the past now.

349
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,890
You're wrong.

350
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,643
Idealistic boy! The world is
one big moral gray area.

351
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,895
It just makes you feel safer
to believe that it can be

352
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:40,939
carefully categorized
into good and bad.

353
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:42,440
That's not actually
how it works.

354
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,608
You're wrong!

355
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,819
Why are you so determined
about this, Kid?

356
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:49,072
Why are you still refusing to
answer any of my questions...?!

357
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,991
What information are you so
desperate to keep hidden?

358
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:03,294
(oh) Hi, Kid...
What's going on here?

359
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,672
Say you're right... Doesn't
that still make the academy

360
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:09,092
the authority that determines
what right and wrong are?

361
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,723
Is that truly how
you think it works?

362
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,686
On that point I fear
I must once again

363
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,648
disagree with you completely.
Things at the academy aren't

364
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:27,152
always as black and white as
you'd like to believe they are.

365
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:46,338
He's finally here... Joe
Butataki, technology consultant

366
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:49,883
from the Oceaniac
division of the DWMA.

367
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,722
Death City. I made it.

368
00:21:55,805 --> 00:22:00,769
My new workplace...
Well, let's get started.

369
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,733
♪ closing song ♪

370
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,404
Kid, you idiot. Have
you found anything yet?

371
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:36,239
Soul sounds a little discontent.

372
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:38,324
Me...? What're
you talking about?

373
00:23:38,408 --> 00:23:39,659
Discontent and angry.

374
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:40,827
Oh, please.

375
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,829
Discontent, angry,
and impatient.

376
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:45,707
Hey... I'm not... oh never mind!

377
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,834
And in denial, too.

378
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:51,338
On the next episode of Soul
Eater... Asura's Temptation...

379
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:53,715
The Big Man's
Uncontrollable Irritation?

380
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,675
Soul is desperate for attention.

381
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,927
Just stick to "Watch it,
or I'll take or soul."

382
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,096
That's my line...
