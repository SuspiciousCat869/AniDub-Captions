would've told you about it.

shouldn't pry too much into it.

partner, don't you?

have any room to talk!

wavelengths, so quit arguing.

with their parents, Maka...

guard my food, will you?

to guard her food...

...yet she refused
to let me have any.

salmon from the buffet?

That was dumb...

It's not like I need
any help from her.

We've entered Death City...

What do you
want us to do now?

161
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,250
Wait at the designated spot
for the signal from us.

162
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,416
One more thing...

163

Have we obtained the
assistance we need?

set... Crona, or should I say,

165
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,666
Ragnarok... will be
leading them here soon.

166
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,458
All right... Good work, Eruka.

167
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,416
Well hello there, Dr. Medusa...

168
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,958
You're having fun, I hope?

169
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,666
Oh... Hello, Professor Stein.

170
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,875
My...! You're always
sneaking up on me!

171
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,916
[Medusa thinks]
This guy again?

172
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,875
You should go ahead and
drink that before I do. Cheers.

173
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,083
Uh... Are you all right,
Professor Stein?

174
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,333
Oh...! Sorry,
I'm a bit drunk...!

175
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,041
I must have had
too much champagne!

176
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,250
[Medusa thinks] Is he faking
it...? I can't read him.

177
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,291
What d'ya say...?

178
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,625
Let's go dancing!

179
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,916
[Stein] Come on,
don't be a party pooper!

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We're all dressed up
and everything!

181
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,666
[Medusa thinks]
Someone help.

182
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,500
[Death Scythe] Know what I'm
thinking about, Maka?

183
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,083
The last time we danced...

184
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,666
It was the day of your
kindergarten graduation...

185
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,666
You danced on my feet...

186
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,416
And then afterwards I
danced with your mama...

187
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,958
What a great day!

188
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,791
[Maka] It wasn't Mama you
were dancing with.

189
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,833
It was actually Sara's mother.

190
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,750
[Death Scythe thinks] Oh,
crap...! Was it really...?

191
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,916
Oh, boy did
I screw that one up...

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,250
Leave it to Maka to
remember that far back.

193
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,333
Anyway... I'm
dancing with you now,

194
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,958
and that's what
counts, isn't it...?

195
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,041
Tonight will be a great memory!

196
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,166
I promise you, Maka...

197
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,916
I'm going to be a better Papa.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,458
No way.

199
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,250
[Medusa thinks]
What am I doing...?

200
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,416
I have to get off
this dance floor...

201
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,083
I can't let Eruka and the
others see me like this.

202
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,750
[Stein]
Dr. Medusa?

203
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,916
Professor Sid has been
gone for quite a while now...

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,583
Do you know anything about that?

205
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,416
[Medusa] Oh...?
I'm afraid I don't know

206
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,750
anything that could help you...

207
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,666
I do hope he's
all right, though.

208
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,583
You're sure you don't know...?

209
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,791
He went to investigate a
laboratory somewhere.

210
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,541
Now let me think here...

211
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,291
Who did that laboratory
belong to, again...?

212
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,166
Oh, that's right!

213
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,000
It was your laboratory. 

214
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,291
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Professor!

215
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,708
[Stein] I'm curious
to know why a witch

216
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,958
like you would risk
coming to the DWMA.

217
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,125
You really are
quite drunk, aren't you...?

218
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,750
Perhaps I should bring
you a glass of water.

219
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,833
I can do without
the water, thank you...

220
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,875
I wasn't really drunk.

221
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,708
I take it the Kishin is
what you're interested in.

222
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,541
I find it hard to imagine you
snuck into the academy just to

223
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:15,416
observe what goes on with all
of our weapons and meisters.

224
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,666
More likely--

225
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,583
you know about it,
don't you Witch Medusa...?

226
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,625
About the Kishin sleeping
beneath the DWMA.

227
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,625
[Medusa]
You hopeless fool...

228
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,791
If it weren't for Lord
Death being here...

229
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
...you'd be dead now.

230
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,291
Shall we cut to the chase...?

231
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,916
No need to hold back...

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I found you out.

233
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,291
You can drop the charade.

234
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,958
All right then...

235
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,375
You're correct, my goal
is to revive the Kishin.

236
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,625
And for that you
needed black blood...

237
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,333
But why? What does it do?

238
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,666
[Medusa] The Kishin's power
surpasses human understanding...

239
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,916
It is evolution itself.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,666
Lord Death and
his little academy

241
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,500
have monitored and protected

242
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,416
the world by acting
as a check against power.

243
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,000
The DWMA seeks only
to maintain the status quo...

244
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,125
That's its mission.

245
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,166
But still...

246
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,583
time continues to march forward.

247
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,125
It's only natural for the
rest of the world to progress

248
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,041
with it, don't you agree...?

249
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,791
That's how nature works.

250
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,125
And yet, Professor Stein,
this academy has made a

251
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
point to keep
that from happening...

252
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,708
Do you really want to
live in a world of stasis,

253
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,916
where nothing changes?

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,166
You're a scientist like me.

255
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,083
Surely you must understand.

256
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,666
So... why don't you join me?

257
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,208
[Sid]
Stein!

258
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,708
Hurry...! Everyone get
out of here immediately!

259
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,583
Professor Sid?!

260
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,416
[Stein]
Are you okay?

261
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,208
Yeah... but I'm not sure how...

262
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,458
We ran into an ambush.

263
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,791
I dove underground
right before the blast...

264
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,916
...but I barely got away.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,833
[explosions]

266
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,875
[Sid]
No...

267
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,625
What we need to do now
is get everyone outta here.

268
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,958
It's a trap...!

269
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,791
This is the day they've
been waiting for.

270
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,833
When Lord Death leaves

271
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,125
his mirror and
all of the students

272
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,166
and teachers are in one place.

273
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,625
Medusa!

274
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,083
[Medusa thinks] Free...!
The barrier!

275
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,875
Now...! Trap them all inside!

276
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,666
Right. I'm on it...

277
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,541
Now, Soul Protect... release!

278
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,875
[Maka thinks]
What is that?

279
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,458
[Free]
Wolf Wolves...

280
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,125
Wolf Wolves.

281
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,958
This will prevent
any interference...

282
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,500
Anyone who gets trapped inside

283
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,541
this magic box will
be unable to escape.

284
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,833
[Medusa]
Eruka, hurry...!

285
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,458
We need to get the
box's position set.

286
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,666
Ribbit, ribbit.

287
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,166
[Medusa]
Computation spell...

288
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,208
Magic Calculation!

289
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,416
What... what is this?

290
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,958
It's starting now... Naigus...

291
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,708
...you ready?
We need soul resonance.

292
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,166
[Naigus]
Yeah. 

293
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,625
We have to get these guys out.

294
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,791
[Free] Appearance
position confirmed...

295
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,375
Spatial Magic:...

296
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,458
Independent Cube! Now!

297
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,416
What's going on?

298
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,125
The room is--!

299
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,708
Key create!

300
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,000
This is gonna be close...

301
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,416
[Free]
Set!

302
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,625
What's happening out there?

303
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,500
What's going on?

304
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sensing something.

305
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,375
I can feel a spatial warping...

306
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,708
That's it...!
They're locking us in!

307
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,750
Here we go...! Forced Burial!

308
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,041
Coffins? What are these for?

309
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,041
[Free]
Lock!

310
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,041
[Maka cries out]

311
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,041
No, Sid.

312
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,833
We're counting on you...
to protect the DWMA.

313
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,625
We've got one hour, Medusa...

314
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
It won't hold longer than that.

315
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,708
In that case...

316
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,875
...let's get gone before
Death shows up.

317
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,958
We don't have a single
second to waste...

318
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,375
Where's Crona?

319
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,166
[Ragnarok cries out]

320
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,083
I brought them
just like you said...

321
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,041
The Mizune family.

322
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,458
[Eruka]
Mizunes!

323
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,708
[Eruka thinks] The only
reason they came to help

324
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,541
was because I lied and
said that the academy

325
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,375
killed the oldest
Mizune sister...

326
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,000
I had to do it...
but I'm so sorry, Mizunes.

327
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,000
[Medusa]
That's it, Mizunes...

328
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,750
I'll leave the rest in
your mousy little hands...

329
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,958
Bring Death City crashing
down around their heads.

330
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,291
Eruka... You've got
the attaché case?

331
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,500
Right here!

332
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,375
We're headed underground.

333
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,458
[Medusa thinks]
I will revive the Kishin.

334
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,125
[Soul] The meisters
landed on their feet,

335
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,500
and the weapons didn't...

336
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,666
I guess we really are different.

337
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,041
I'm sensing some
witch souls up there...

338
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,458
One... two... eight of them...!

339
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,583
And the Demon Sword, also!

340
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,833
What was that?
What are they doing up there?

341
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,333
[Stein]
Listen up kids...

342
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,875
We've got an
emergency on our hands.

343
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,500
Below the DWMA...

344
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,083
...sleeps a Kishin...

345
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,750
...the source of
all madness in the world.

346
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,791
You should know,

347
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,333
our school nurse
Medusa is a witch...

348
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,000
She snuck into the
academy to revive the Kishin.

349
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,208
We must stop this at all costs.

350
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,958
Doctor Medusa is actually
a witch, professor...?

351
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,208
That's crazy.

352
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,625
And this Kishin, too...?

353
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,583
How's something like
that beneath the school?

354
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,458
[Kid]
It's true.

355
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,416
My father explained
everything to me...

356
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,166
In order to keep
the Kishin sleeping,

357
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,333
safe and sound...

358
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,458
...my father cannot ever
leave the academy.

359
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,250
Huh...? So there's a reason

360
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,083
Lord Death never
goes anywhere...?

361
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,083
I always thought he just

362
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,625
wasn't much of
a people person...

363
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,875
Let's get moving...

364
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,791
We can't let Sid's quick
thinking go to waste.

365
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,166
All of you follow me...

366
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,166
I'll take us to the entrance
that leads underground.

367
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,416
[Woman]
It didn't budge.

368
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,125
[Death] Oh my... We're in
a real pickle here...

369
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,583
...yep... Quite a predicament.

370
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,458
[Kilik]
Lord Death!

371
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,375
You need to get
out of here, sir...

372
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,875
Can you escape through this?

373
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,333
[Death]
A mirror?

374
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:18,541
Unfortunately,
that's a no-can-do.

375
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,083
You see, there wouldn't
be anywhere to go...

376
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,916
This space is cut off
from all other worlds.

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,791
At best a high-octane spell

378
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,791
like this will only hold up
for an hour or so.

379
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,458
There isn't a whole lot
we can do until then.

380
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,416
Oh. I understand.

381
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,625
Sorry about that, kid.

382
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,291
Damn!

383
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,125
We've been acting
so complacent...

384
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,583
We're just too used to peace.

385
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,083
[Death] Hey, now...
there's nothing wrong

386
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,083
with being used to peace.

387
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,041
I think we should
get more used to it...

388
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,083
Because that would mean
the world is a peaceful place.

389
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,750
So we're gonna sit here,
preserving the peace.

390
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,916
Because that's what this
academy was built for.

391
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,583
As for the rest of it...

392
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,416
...it's all up to them now.

393
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,541
[Stein]
This is the entrance we need.

394
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,875
Our enemy is powerful.

395
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,250
If you aren't prepared
for what lies ahead...

396
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,791
...then you may die.

397
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,750
If you want to turn around...
better do it now.

398
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,083
Are you ready to fight
against fear itself...?

399
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,416
Will you cross
beyond that door...?

400
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,541
Let your souls make
the decision for you.

401
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,958
We're coming!

402
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,916
[Stein]
Good.

403
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:55,833
♪ closing song ♪

404
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,250
[Soul] Let's fight.
Let's do this.

405
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,666
I'm ready. Let's get going!

406
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,375
[Maka] Whoa, Soul...
You're too worked up...

407
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,541
Calm down a little, okay?

408
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,666
[Soul] What are
you talking about?

409
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,250
Why shouldn't I be
pumped right now...

410
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,291
[Maka] In situations like this,
you need to keep your cool...

411
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,625
Let's try a little exercise...

412
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,666
Repeat after me...

413
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,250
"I will be cool."

414
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,833
[Soul] Sounds kinda dumb to me,
but fine... I will be cool...

415
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:39,833
I will be cool...

416
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:40,958
Okay, can we fight now?

417
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,375
[Maka]
Oh, never mind!

418
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,250
[Soul] On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

419
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,833
The Underground
Battle Commences...

420
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,583
Break Through
Medusa's Vector Arrow?~

421
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,416
[Maka]
Watch it...

422
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,458
...or I'll take your soul!
