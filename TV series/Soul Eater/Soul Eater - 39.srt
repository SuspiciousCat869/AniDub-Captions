1
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:46,161
A sound soul...

2
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:48,371
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,166
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:56,755
You've already done everything
you need to do here...

5
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,465
There's no reason
for you to stay.

6
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:00,467
Medusa wants you to join
her now to help with

7
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,678
some other tasks she
has in mind for you.

8
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:07,974
But... I don't wanna leave...
I wanna stay right here.

9
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,893
Personally, I don't care
one way or the other.

10
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:11,936
I just pass along
information...

11
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,607
But I can't say that Medusa
will feel the same way.

12
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,151
This is the first time
I've ever had friends...

13
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:21,946
If I leave, I won't be able
to see them anymore.

14
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,283
Your whining is giving
me a headache!

15
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,578
Just do what Medusa
tells you to, idiot...

16
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:32,582
Sooner or later everyone
here will find out what you did.

17
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:34,959
Or have you already forgotten
the snake you planted in

18
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,712
Marie to accelerate the
pace of Stein's madness?

19
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,881
When they know about that,
there's no way you're going to

20
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:42,258
get off with a
Reaper Chop or two!

21
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:44,844
And you know that won't be it.

22
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:48,473
Just think how Maka will feel.
She'll probably cry.

23
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,727
Don't you see it's over?
Nothing you can do now will

24
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:55,355
change the fact that
you betrayed them all.

25
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,443
♪ opening song ♪

26
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:39,167
Wake up...! Get out here!

27
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,211
We came a long way
to get here...!

28
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:44,089
The least you can do is invite
us in and offer us a drink!

29
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,924
Are you finished?

30
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,425
Huh?

31
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,886
That's the Kishin in there...
You can yell and complain

32
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,348
all you want, it won't bother
him more than a buzzing fly.

33
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:56,935
Well maybe he'd rather hear
the screaming of a mosquito.

34
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,479
Looking for a fight, old man?

35
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:08,238
Lady Arachne! Please wait...!
Let us go in first!

36
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,256
You can stay out there.
I'll handle this alone.

37
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:29,509
Lady Arachne.

38
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:37,225
Crona's Escape... Show Me
Your Smile, Please?o~

39
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:53,116
Greetings Kishin Asura...
I am Lady Arachne.

40
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,910
I know your great power
and respect it...

41
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:58,496
I have journeyed
far to meet you...

42
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,166
Will you not show me your face?

43
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:06,963
I've heard others say you hide
here because you're timid.

44
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:08,381
But I suspect you came to this

45
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:12,469
isolated mountain to rejuvenate
your soul. Am I correct?

46
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,346
Perhaps I'm wrong...

47
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:17,640
Perhaps you're as afraid of
the Grim Reaper as they say.

48
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:26,358
I grow weary of hide and seek.
Please come out.

49
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,942
Go away.

50
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:37,869
Are you this intimidated by a
lone woman? That's almost cute.

51
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,513
I found you.

52
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:59,808
I've been looking forward
to this moment.

53
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:03,436
What are you planning...? What
is it you want with me, woman?

54
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,523
The Reaper has stood
in my way long enough.

55
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,109
I want you to help
me eliminate him.

56
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:14,280
I've hated him for
eight hundred years.

57
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,282
I loathe him more
now than ever...

58
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,786
You understand how that
feels. I know you do.

59
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,213
If we don't join forces,
we'll both fall to him again.

60
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:31,715
Is that what you want?

61
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:35,176
To be tied up in a sack
of your own skin again?

62
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,845
Fight with me...

63
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:40,015
Together we'll be so strong
nothing can hurt us...

64
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:54,988
We'll protect each other.

65
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:58,992
I'll give it all to you... Don't
you see what I'm offering?

66
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:05,832
My heart... my soul. All of it.
Is yours to claim.

67
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,463
Yummy!

68
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,465
Hey, Crona, you should
practice with us the next

69
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:15,425
time we work on
resonance link...

70
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:18,219
It's fun, and I know you'd add
a lot of strength to our team.

71
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,471
Oh...Uh... yeah...

72
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:20,889
And I'll be there, so you'll be

73
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:24,642
trained by the best of the
best. You can't beat that!

74
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,228
Have another sandwich,
Crona. There's plenty.

75
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,438
Thanks.

76
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:31,524
You may be ugly,
but your food is delicious!

77
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,695
Actually, I can't take credit
for the food this time...

78
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,989
It was a special treat
from Miss Marie.

79
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,618
I'm sure taking care of
Professor Stein is pretty hard

80
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:45,497
on her but somehow she still
makes time to take care of us.

81
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,708
I'm gonna kill whoever did this
to the professor... Of course,

82
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,378
I'll have to eat first to
build up my strength.

83
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,797
Hey...! Why don't we go visit
the professor...?

84
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,299
I'm sure he'd love to see
you... What do you say, Crona?

85
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,301
Do you want to come along?

86
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:01,846
I...I... I have to
use the restroom!

87
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:05,100
You can do that by
yourself. I'm staying here...

88
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:09,521
Hey! There's still food to eat!
Where're you going?

89
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,606
I wanna stay with the food!

90
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,983
That's weird even for him.

91
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:30,667
It's impossible... How could
I ever tell them what I did?

92
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,337
Ragnarok was
right. I can't stay.

93
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,673
I don't belong here anymore.

94
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:42,512
You're such an
obedient child, Crona.

95
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,348
You finally see the
truth, don't you?

96
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:47,350
You don't fit in
here, not really...

97
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:51,521
The only place you'll
ever belong is with me.

98
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,231
Lady Medusa...

99
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:04,659
You should be more careful.

100
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:08,371
This belongs in a frame,
not on the ground.

101
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:09,873
Oh, yeah...

102
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,838
Uh, Maka?

103
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,008
Do... um... do you think
I could ask you something.

104
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,677
Of course... Ask me anything.

105
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,388
I, um... I was wondering
about your mother.

106
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:28,558
Oh. It's complicated.
She's sort of missing right now.

107
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:31,019
Wait hold on... What do
you mean missing?

108
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:34,397
Well... occasionally she'll
send me a postcard.

109
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:37,650
So I know she's off somewhere
traveling around the world,

110
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:40,945
but I don't really know where
she is or what she's doing.

111
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,198
She abandoned her daughter
to go on some trip...?

112
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,909
Who would do
something like that?

113
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:48,453
So... what...
What kind of person is she?

114
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:51,164
She's like a grizzly bear.

115
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:52,874
A... grizzly bear?

116
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,751
She's strong... hot-tempered...

117
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,128
You don't want to see
her when she's angry.

118
00:09:57,212 --> 00:10:00,507
But she's still warm and
kind-hearted and loyal.

119
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,593
That seems like a lot of things
for one person to be...

120
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:07,013
So... um... Tell me some
more. What's the best memory

121
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:09,849
you have from when you
were younger, of her?

122
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,227
That's easy...
Definitely the divorce.

123
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,728
Huh?!

124
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:17,899
She was so cool and collected...
It was pretty amazing.

125
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:21,611
What a weird answer... Maka's
got a strange family life.

126
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,114
What's wrong...? Did I say
something odd?

127
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:28,201
Oh...! No...

128
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:31,287
I know that-- I know
she's not around now,

129
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,456
but how do you feel about her?

130
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,419
She's my mom, silly. I love her.

131
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,801
Didn't you say you had
to use the restroom?

132
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:46,302
Yeah.

133
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:50,974
I'll need five hundred
tons of concrete

134
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,476
and two hundred
tons of I-beams.

135
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,270
Also thirty thousand
bearings with

136
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,188
a five hundred
millimeter diameter...

137
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,107
...you think you
can make that happen?

138
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,442
Why do you need all that?

139
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,861
Are you planning to
build a skyscraper?

140
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:06,906
Whether it's fixing leaky pipes
or constructing a building...

141
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,869
if Lord Death asks me
to do something, I'll do it.

142
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,163
How obedient of you.

143
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:18,001
Hey I forgot to
tell you something.

144
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,628
If you see Uncle Bob
from the coffee shop

145
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,380
I need you to let me know...

146
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:26,634
It's very important. I can't
dance without my Rumba coffee.

147
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:29,346
I forgot to tell you
something, too.

148
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,638
You should get some new shoes.

149
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:33,433
Sandals aren't safe
for construction.

150
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:37,562
Does he have no respect for

151
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:40,065
a man's personal
taste in footwear?

152
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,568
Joe Buttataki.

153
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,528
He's a hard man to grasp...

154
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,865
Like the steam rising
from his coffee cup...

155
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,242
I find him unsettling.

156
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:52,952
He reminds me too
much of my father.

157
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:55,330
Unwilling to reveal
his secrets...

158
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,832
Always hiding behind a mask...

159
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,211
Not telling anyone what
his true intentions are.

160
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:14,974
There...! That's much better.

161
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:24,526
What the hell is going on down
here?! This is unacceptable.

162
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,078
Who could perpetrate
such a horror?!

163
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,122
And there he goes.
We've lost him again.

164
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,623
Hey, wait!

165
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,459
Where did he go?!

166
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,462
Quit it, Patty!

167
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,887
This Kid is becoming
troublesome.

168
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,889
Why's he so persistent...?

169
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,518
He should just relax with
a good cup of coffee.

170
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,020
It was like this
when I got here...

171
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:03,314
Empty. No belongings. No Crona.

172
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,993
He probably ran away.

173
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:16,870
But why would he do that?

174
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,413
He's been acting
strange lately.

175
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,832
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed... Distant.

176
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:22,667
Scared all the time.

177
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,835
It almost seemed like he didn't

178
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:26,504
want to hang around
with us anymore...

179
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:30,383
Admit it... You sensed it too.

180
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,637
At any rate, Lord Death
will find out he's

181
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:38,350
gone sooner or later.
And he won't be pleased.

182
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,060
I'll find him.

183
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,811
Hey, Maka...

184
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,899
Just like her...Running
off after him

185
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:48,234
without a thought in her head.

186
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:06,878
Crona... Why...? Why'd you go?
Where are you?

187
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:18,682
Why now...? I don't understand.

188
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,685
Everyone thinks you ran away,

189
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,270
but they're wrong...
aren't they?

190
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,702
I don't know why
you're so bummed.

191
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,078
Just think, we never have to

192
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:42,038
look at their ugly
faces again...!

193
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:44,374
Give it a little while.
Once you get home,

194
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:47,127
you'll forget all about
the stupid academy.

195
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,963
I don't think so. I'm not
going back to Medusa.

196
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,297
Huh?!

197
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,049
I can't stay at the academy,
and I can't go home.

198
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,592
I just want to be alone.

199
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,719
A weakling like you...?

200
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,595
You won't last two
days on your own...

201
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,722
What are you going
to do for food...?

202
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,265
If you're not going
to Medusa's,

203
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:03,268
you might as well turn around
and go back to the academy!

204
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:08,148
Get off of me...! There's no
way I can go back there!

205
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,817
--Stupid kid. What, are you
doing, trying to starve me...?
--I couldn't stand them
being so nice to

206
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,820
--I'm not gonna die
in the desert with you.
--me after I betrayed them.
It was breaking my heart.

207
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:20,326
--You don't know anything,
you useless pansy!
--Stop it! That hurts...!. Get
off me...! Get off m--

208
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:33,840
Please forgive me, Lady Arachne!
You must be in so much pain...!

209
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:36,384
That should never have
happened while I was with you...

210
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,722
It's all my fault...!
Please, please forgive me!

211
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:44,392
We succeeded in recruiting
the Kishin to our side.

212
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,854
This is a time to
celebrate, not to cry.

213
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,690
Yes... my lady.

214
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,776
Well, it wasn't
easy, but I did it.

215
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,778
Our new Kishin friend's
been given the best

216
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,404
bedroom we had available.

217
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:00,450
He even had a little snack on
the way... three of our men.

218
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,452
He's like a dog being
introduced to its

219
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,621
new owner for the first time.

220
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,415
He'll be suspicious
of us at first.

221
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,293
Tasty.

222
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,215
How long are we going to
stay in this hole...?

223
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,509
I'm baking in this sun!

224
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,804
I found a place where I can
be alone, like I wanted...

225
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:23,723
I'll stay here until
I'm ready to leave.

226
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,735
I've been somewhere
like this before...

227
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,279
A lonely place without water.

228
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:42,826
That's where we met. My first
lonely place in the desert.

229
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:46,162
Will you let me be
your friend Crona?

230
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:52,460
It was like feeling
sunlight for the first time.

231
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,547
But we were as different
as night and day...

232
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,756
How could I ever let myself

233
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,509
imagine our friendship
would last?

234
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,637
It was a nice dream, I guess...

235
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,557
...but it would be better
if I could forget it.

236
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,143
Crona!

237
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,230
Crona!

238
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:13,857
You're sure this
is the right spot?

239
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,819
Yeah... I'm positive.
I can feel his soul nearby.

240
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,738
Crona!

241
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,324
Maka.

242
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,660
Stop here, Soul!

243
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,958
Crona! I finally found you!

244
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,043
And let's get you
out of there...

245
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,961
Hey, Soul...! Gimme a hand!

246
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,671
Why did you come after me?

247
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,760
You can leave me alone...
I didn't ask for your help.

248
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,848
Go away! I said, go away!

249
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,977
Why, Crona?

250
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:54,939
I don't want you here. You don't
understand anything about me...

251
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:57,275
Go...! Just get out of here!

252
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:04,324
I... I can't look at you...
not after... what I did.

253
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,327
The... the things that have been
happening to Professor Stein...

254
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,746
...those...those are all
because of me...

255
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,915
It was in Miss
Marie's drink... I...

256
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:16,795
I put one of Lady Medusa's
special little snakes in it.

257
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:20,548
Miss Marie never even
suspected me for a second.

258
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,969
She liked me... She kept telling
me what a good kid I was.

259
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,472
Why'd she do that? I never
asked her to be nice to me...!

260
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,224
Having faith in other people...

261
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,393
Trusting someone
not to hurt you...

262
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:36,022
How idiotic is that...?!
You know?!

263
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,776
Stop... Don't move...
Not another word.

264
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,861
Maka...? Hey!

265
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:53,581
Don't you dare say one more
negative thing about yourself.

266
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,046
You think of yourself as someone
who is cowardly and weak...

267
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,214
...yet, whenever
something happens,

268
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:03,883
you put everyone else first.

269
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:11,099
And then...You end up getting
hurt... Please stop this...

270
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:14,144
You're hurting my friend,
and I can't take it.

271
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:25,155
Please tell me I'm right?!

272
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:32,787
No... I... I can't say it.

273
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:42,547
I hate this so much...
but there's nothing I can do...!

274
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,300
I'm so tired of all
of this... When...?

275
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:50,013
...can I stop... hur--
hurting people...? I...

276
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,432
I don't wanna hurt
anybody...! I don't wanna

277
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:58,688
make people sad! I don't
wanna lose my only friend!

278
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:07,030
You see? I am a coward, like
I said. And... and I might...

279
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:09,949
...end up betraying you again!

280
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:16,456
I won't let that happen...
I promise, I won't!

281
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:20,710
What do you say...?
Can we go home?

282
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,681
Have they realized
they're in a big hole yet?

283
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,767
I suppose they're expecting
me to dig them out of there...

284
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,980
Not cool. Not even
a little bit cool.

285
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:47,070
Hmm... I understand
your loyalty to your friend...

286
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:50,490
...but Crona did sign
the academy agreement.

287
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,492
Students who break the
rules are expelled...

288
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:54,077
That's the way it works...

289
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,746
Making an exception for him
would undermine the stability

290
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,374
of the entire academy.
It can't be done.

291
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,084
Crona knows he was wrong.

292
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,503
He already apologized
for what he did...

293
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:05,171
He feels awful about all of it!

294
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:10,176
Maka... this problem can't be
solved by saying sorry.

295
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,388
What Crona did
was extremely serious.

296
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:16,057
You're a fine one
to talk about loyalty.

297
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,228
You don't know what loyalty is!
How many promises did you break

298
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,730
when you and Mom
were together?!

299
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,108
How many times did you say
'sorry' only to do it again?!

300
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,402
Those two situations
have nothing in common.

301
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,112
Don't you understand
the gravity of this?

302
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:30,905
No, I don't!

303
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,700
If you got a second chance,
so should he.

304
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,745
I trust him not to do it again.

305
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,581
Hmmm...

306
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,000
Lord Death...!

307
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,960
An urgent police report!

308
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:46,087
Someone's been
sighted in the city!

309
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,715
"Someone" being...?

310
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,800
The snake woman has come back.

311
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,853
It's Medusa.

312
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,570
Why have you come here?

313
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:16,034
I'm not here to fight you.
I surrender.

315
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:50,253
Wow, that was a really
good episode, wasn't it, Sis?

316
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:52,672
I guess...
If you're sentimental.

317
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:56,468
That part at the end was
so sweet it made me cry!

318
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,762
I suppose it was
a little touching.

319
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:01,973
It looks like it even
made you cry, big sis!

320
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:04,684
I'm not crying. I don't know
what you're talking about.

321
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:06,686
But your face is wet,
and your eyes are all puffy!

322
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,729
Uh...

323
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:09,814
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

324
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:12,901
The Cards Are Cut... Medusa
Surrenders to The DWMA?o~

325
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,737
I told you, I wasn't crying!
