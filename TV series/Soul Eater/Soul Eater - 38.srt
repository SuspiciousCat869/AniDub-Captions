1
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:46,411
A sound soul...

2
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,621
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:51,416
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:56,087
With the Battle for Brew
seemingly complete,

5
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:59,966
each side moved on to the
next step of their plan.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,346
Some students, however,
cannot forget their failure.

7
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:09,392
Meanwhile, I began investigating
my dad's intentions for

8
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:13,730
collecting Eibon's dangerous
works. I wanted the truth.

9
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:17,067
But the information I
obtained only deepened

10
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,570
my suspicions of the
academy's recent activities.

11
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:29,913
I made it...

12
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:35,377
Death City My new workplace.
Well, let's get started.

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,465
♪ opening song ♪

14
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:09,054
Hello, hello... I'm so
glad to see you're here.

15
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,181
It's always good to see
a representative from

16
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:14,434
our technology division.
Do you prefer your full name,

17
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:18,355
Joe Butataki... Or do
you still go by JB?

18
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,523
Everything okay?

19
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,234
Yeah. Everything's fine...

20
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,404
Let's talk about why
you called me here.

21
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:27,864
Your summons seemed urgent.

22
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:29,908
Should I assume that the
project's already begun?

23
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,077
Aren't you getting a bit
ahead of yourself...?

24
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,913
I haven't even told you what
you're doing here yet.

25
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:37,207
Yes, I'm sorry but ...
why else would you

26
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,501
have called me,
if not for that?

27
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:42,128
Of course that's why, but
can't you let me say it?

28
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,339
You're kinda stealing
my thunder here...

29
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:45,799
Besides, there are
some new developments

30
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,175
you should know about...

31
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,719
We lost our most recent
battle with Arachnophobia...

32
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,471
and Brew is now in their hands.

33
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:54,265
That makes your presence
here all the more important.

34
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,811
It sounds like the academy's
at a serious disadvantage now.

35
00:03:57,894 --> 00:04:00,230
Indeed we are... And I'm
not sure there's much

36
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,649
of anything I can do about it.

37
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:06,569
So, what happens to the plan
now that the enemy has Brew?

38
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,947
Well, fortunately,
we've managed to acquire a

39
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,158
number of Eibon's
other Magic Tools.

40
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,245
And that's where
you come in...!

41
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:17,122
What do you say:
Given the circumstances,

42
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:19,374
can you help keep
our plan on track?

43
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,502
The plan was my idea.
I'd hate to see it ruined...

44
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:23,586
I'll give it a try.

45
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,964
I knew I could count on you!

46
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,800
However, I have one
condition before I start.

47
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:31,511
And that condition would be...?

48
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:33,680
The coffee...

49
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:35,181
Coffee?

50
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:38,184
This is a disgrace!
Instant coffee?!

51
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,103
I won't work here until this

52
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,230
--Now, now, let's
keep calm here.
--shameful practice has
been stopped...!

53
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:44,399
--There's no need to
get so excited.
--You must get rid of this
disgusting powder,

54
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,483
--Perhaps you've had a bit
too much caffeine today.
--and replace it
with whole beans!

55
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,401
And they must come
from Uncle Bob's!

56
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:49,446
Only the finest
quality will do!

57
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,156
This point is non-negotiable!

58
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,116
I also require that you
stock my preferred

59
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,743
brand of coffee creamer!

60
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,995
Finally, the filters must
be made of sturdy paper

61
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,664
so no grounds will
pollute the coffee!

62
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,299
Coffee beans?

63
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,718
Yes, coffee beans!

64
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:20,060
Asura's Temptation: The Big
Man's Uncontrollable Irritation?

65
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,568
You serious?
First Kid disappears,

66
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,196
now Black Star's
taken off, too?

67
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,156
What's gotten into
everyone around here?

68
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:37,911
That's not all. Tsubaki's gone
too... I wonder what's going on.

69
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,288
Couldn't tell ya.

70
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:43,291
Something's been
bothering Black Star.

71
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:48,046
He hasn't been himself lately...
He seems so dispirited.

72
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,763
Why do I keep losing?

73
00:05:56,846 --> 00:06:00,475
I'm supposed to be the one
who'll surpass God...

74
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:04,979
So why? Why?!

75
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:11,403
Why do you desire
such great power?

76
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,793
Black Star didn't show up
to class. I wonder where he is.

77
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,294
Tsubaki.

78
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,132
Oh, hi Naigus.

79
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,217
Do you have a sec?

80
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,894
What's a consultant from
the tech division...

81
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:48,398
...doing at the academy?

82
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,900
News travels fast around
here, doesn't it?

83
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:55,280
I only just got in and already
the questions have started.

84
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,782
So who's that make you?
The welcome wagon?

85
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:01,578
Death the Kid, actually...
I was named after my father.

86
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:04,998
I see... So your Lord Death's
little son, are you?

87
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,833
What brings you to
the academy...?

88
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,376
You've come a long way.

89
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,297
What part do you have to
play in my dad's plans?

90
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,215
Construction.

91
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,801
The plumbing here at
the academy is old.

92
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,846
It's in pretty bad shape...
That's why I'm here.

93
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:23,350
Not even a good lie. You'll
have to do better than that.

94
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,310
You wouldn't have come all
this way for plumbing.

95
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:26,936
Well... uh...

96
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,730
Of course that isn't
the only reason!

97
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,816
The boiler needs some
work done on it too.

98
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,319
Now that's a job for the
tech division... huh?

99
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:38,239
It might be if the
academy had a boiler.

100
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,200
In the past few months,
the academy's bent

101
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,244
all its efforts on
collecting Magic Tools.

102
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,831
And then, out of nowhere,
a technology expert just

103
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,209
happens to show up...
So you'll excuse me if

104
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,462
I think there's something
more to this than our pipes.

105
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,509
If these Magic Tools are as
rusty as my poker face,

106
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:01,012
I'm going to have a lot more
work than I bargained for.

107
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:04,683
Come back...!
I'm not done talking.

108
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:07,143
Here's some free advice.

109
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:08,228
Huh?

110
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,813
Let it go... I'm here
to do some work.

111
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,065
That's all you need to know.

112
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,528
So, tell me...
How's Uncle Bob doing?

113
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,154
Uncle Bob?

114
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:21,241
The man who runs the coffee
shop not far from here.

115
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,076
Uncle Bob's Rumba Coffee...!

116
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,704
"So delicious it'll make you
dance!" Come on, everybody!

117
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:27,455
Do the Rumba! Shake
your hips and do the

118
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,541
--Uncle Bob's coffee
rumba with me!

119
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,042
--I don't know what
you're talking about.
--Uncle Bob's coffee
rumba with me!

120
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:37,298
You don't know Uncle Bob?
That's a crying shame, kid.

121
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,800
Hey!

122
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,362
Here it is.

123
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:14,878
Lord Death's vault...
It's time to get started.

124
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,638
It's over, kid.

125
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:28,641
It isn't over yet.
Not until I've beaten you.

126
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:33,188
Black Star.

127
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,734
You don't understand
the Enchanted Sword.

128
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:40,779
You won't ever be able to
harness its full power...

129
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:43,239
You aren't strong enough.

130
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:45,200
What do you know?!
I'm Black Star.

131
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:46,618
I can do anything!

132
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:51,039
No. No, you can't.

133
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:53,583
It's all over... Just give up.

134
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,877
You have lost.

135
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:08,223
I've been looking
all over for you.

136
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,141
I'm here.

137
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:14,104
It's the last place
I checked, of course.

138
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,981
What're you doing here?

139
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,235
Thinking about how
I'm going surpass God.

140
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,070
Why am I not surprised?

141
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,782
Should you be skipping class?

142
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,867
I skipped class to see
where you were...

143
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:30,537
I didn't expect to end up on
the roof, but here we are.

144
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,581
Yeah... here we are.

145
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:37,043
I ran into Naigus...
She told me not to use

146
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,212
the Enchanted Sword
mode anymore.

147
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:40,714
What?

148
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:43,925
She said it's been putting
too much strain on your body.

149
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,261
Yeah right.

150
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,304
What a joke...
Nothing could make me

151
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:51,975
give up on mastering
the Enchanted Sword.

152
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,019
I understand.

153
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:59,566
How could you give up...?
You haven't surpassed God yet.

154
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,823
No... not yet.

155
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,717
What is it?

156
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,641
Oh, hey, Kid. You're back.

157
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,477
And where did you run off to?

158
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,231
Sorry. I was busy...
I had some things to look into.

159
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:41,524
What kinda things?

160
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,360
What could be so important
that you had to look

161
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,945
into it without telling
us where you were going?

162
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,365
I'll explain it later,
after class is over...

163
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,241
It's a long story...
For now there's something

164
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,118
else I need you
to help me with.

165
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:53,328
What?

166
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,789
Where have you been, Kid?

167
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,123
Is everything okay?

168
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,126
Of course.
Everything's just fine.

169
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:04,464
I can't afford to let any
of the other students know

170
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:07,175
what I'm up to. It's
too soon for that...

171
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:10,720
For now, this
investigation's a solo job.

172
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:13,223
It's Black Star.

173
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:16,893
You finally showed up...
Do you know what time it is?

174
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:22,065
I came for you, Kid...
Step outside for a second.

175
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:29,906
What's this about...?

176
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,908
Are you having some sort
of a problem here?

177
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,411
I wanted to show you something.

178
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:35,829
What are you doing?!

179
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,914
Yahoo!!

180
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,461
Not again?!

181
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:49,009
Look what you did, you idiot!
The DWMA building was

182
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,094
perfectly symmetrical,
and now you've destroyed it!

183
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:53,096
How could you?!

184
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,473
Come on down here, Kid.

185
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,768
Let's fight about it.

186
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,937
What?

187
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:10,196
So, how's Crona doing?

188
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,323
He's been acting
strange lately...

189
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,368
Something seems to
be bothering him.

190
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,829
Why do you say that...?
Has he asked any questions

191
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,498
recently that seem out of
the ordinary for him?

192
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:23,585
Well... Now that you mention
it, he did ask about Stein's

193
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:26,463
condition after the
battle on Lost Island.

194
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:30,675
Oh? That is unexpected...
Why would a child like

195
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,136
Crona be concerned
about Professor Stein?

196
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:35,805
I don't get it.
He seemed really shaken up.

197
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,724
How unfortunate.

198
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:45,815
Poor Crona...I don't think he'll
be of use to me much longer.

199
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:51,696
What's going on?
Why are you guys fighting?

200
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,698
I don't see what's
so surprising...

201
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:56,284
Black Star gets into
fights all the time.

202
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,161
Yeah, but still...

203
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,704
So, Black Star...

204
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,580
Huh?

205
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:03,750
Taking on Kid this time, are we?

206
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,294
The ref's here.
We can get started now.

207
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,837
Hold on, both of you...!

208
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,839
What's the point of this stupid
duel in the first place!...?

209
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:12,133
This is ridiculous!

210
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,303
What Tsubaki?

211
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,015
I'm sorry, but... This is
something Black Star

212
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,893
feels he has to do, so
please don't interfere.

213
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,187
You brought this on
yourself, Black Star...

214
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,980
You knew damn well
how I'd react if

215
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:29,651
the academy's symmetry
was destroyed!

216
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:34,197
Reaper Combat Art: Mortal Sin
Stance. There's no helping it.

217
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,032
I have to beat you to
a pulp very quickly

218
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:39,786
then immediately see to
the necessary repairs.

219
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,288
Let's go.

220
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:57,470
You going to take your
hands out of your pockets?

221
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:00,849
Are you trying to win this
thing without using your hands?

222
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,727
Maybe I am.

223
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:07,814
Damn.

224
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,524
That's fast.

225
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,153
No time to block!

226
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,655
Here comes his soul wavelength.

227
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,490
It's all over.

228
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,081
What was that?

229
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:26,583
Black Star.

230
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,753
Do you remember the
first time we met...?

231
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:32,172
We fought in this
exact same place...

232
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,798
Since then, you've
improved your fighting

233
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:38,094
technique significantly.
You've got more style.

234
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:43,266
But I have to say...
You've gotten a bit weak.

235
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:47,354
He's lost confidence in himself.

236
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:49,564
That's why his Soul Force
attack didn't work.

237
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,775
His wavelength is
paralyzed by doubt.

238
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,360
Is that even possible?!

239
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:56,363
I've seen it happen before...
It doesn't take much to

240
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:57,697
change a soul wavelength.

241
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,325
Doubting yourself will
do it every time.

242
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:04,662
I've known Black Star for a long
time... Since he was an infant.

243
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:09,542
He has great talent.
His soul is strong.

244
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,961
He's willing to work hard.

245
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,673
Against a single opponent
or many, it doesn't matter...

246
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:17,550
He'll beat them
all, one by one.

247
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:21,930
That's what he does. That's who
he is: someone who wins.

248
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,726
But lately he's begun to lose
fights, one after the other.

249
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,068
His battle with the samurai
Mifune was the most damaging.

250
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,153
It was a total defeat.

251
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:41,991
If you think back, you'll
see that was about the

252
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,703
time when his attitude
started to change.

253
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,746
He can't handle his
recent losses...

254
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,540
He wasn't built to lose.

255
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:51,584
That's why he's been so angry?

256
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,795
It goes back even
further, I think.

257
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,588
His difficulties with the
Enchanted Sword have

258
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:58,800
been a blow to his
self-confidence.

259
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,719
I can't blame him...
Someone with a weaker

260
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,596
soul would have given
up a long time ago.

261
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,101
But that little idiot
doesn't even know

262
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,437
the meaning of giving up.

263
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,400
You're quiet... Do you want to
tell me what's on your mind?

264
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:19,821
What's on my mind...? Just that
I'm surrounded by morons!

265
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,990
Why's he have to keep
pushing himself so hard...?

266
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,450
I'm sure he'll get the
hang of it sooner

267
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,285
or later if he'll just wait.

268
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:28,329
A long time ago, when I was
alive, I was a handsome man.

269
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,497
Huh?

270
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,708
We adults are often
stuck in the past...

271
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,128
...and children can only
think about the future.

272
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,213
But Black Star lives
in the present...

273
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:41,426
He can't wait for the future...
He has to find his path now.

274
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:47,390
Find my path? It's not about
finding... It's about winning.

275
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:51,728
Stop spouting your useless
philosophies... Stupid zombie.

276
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,104
Sid.

277
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:58,651
I see it. Those eyes...
That wavelength.

278
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,947
White Star.

279
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:08,912
Is he following
his father's path?

280
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:13,291
Black Star! Let's forget
about the broken cone...

281
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,377
Just walk away!

282
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,588
I can't walk away now!
And I'll kill you before

283
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,882
I let you give up either!

284
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:59,671
What happened, Black Star...?
Who are you?

285
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:08,221
Your dream. I thought you
wanted to surpass God.

286
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:30,577
Um...

287
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,704
There's no need to apologize...

288
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:34,914
This isn't the last time
it's going to happen.

289
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,791
It's who he is.

290
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,043
I know.

291
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,587
The important thing is
what happens next...

292
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,715
Can he really keep
living like this?

293
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,261
He's doing better now.
I think he'll be all right...

294
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:51,473
He's just got a few things
left to learn, that's all.

295
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:59,105
Yeah... I hope you're right.

296
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,027
What are you waiting for...?
This was your idea.

297
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,655
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know...

298
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,032
What's the big deal...?

299
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:11,076
Just go in there and ask how
he's doing or something.

300
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,744
Or do you not care
about him at all?

301
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,288
How could you even say
that...! He's our teammate.

302
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,582
Of course I care about him!

303
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,626
Then why are you still
standing out here in the hall?

304
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,627
Get in there!

305
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,504
No...! Wait!
I haven't thought of

306
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:24,047
something appropriate
to say yet...!

307
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,049
No, please, Soul!

308
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,134
Thirty-three thousand,
four hundred fifty six...

309
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:30,345
Thirty-three thousand,
four hundred fifty seven...

310
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,514
Thirty-three thousand,
four hundred fifty eight...

311
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,766
Thirty-three thousand,
four hundred fifty nine...

312
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,102
Thirty-three thousand,
four hundred sixty...

313
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,646
Thirty-three thousand,
four hundred sixty one...
