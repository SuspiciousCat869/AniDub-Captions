your weapon Death

[Liz] And wait-- you sent
a group of students

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,458
to go collect his soul?

He should send you,

Only if I really
felt like dying...

You're overestimating
me a little bit, Patty...

I wouldn't last two seconds...

17
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,166
These are remedial
lessons, right?

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,500
Aren't you asking
a bit too much?

Let's hurry and
finish this guy off...

I wonder what kind

Hmm...

Maybe that'll take care of it.

00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,291
Okay...

38
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm gonna try that again.

39
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,708
Um...
Shouldn't someone stop him?

40
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,625
But we just met him.
Isn't that rude?

Yeah if you're really Dr. Stein.

49
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,916
You did this...

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,083
You're the one who
turned Sid into a zombie.

[Stein]
Oh... so that's it...

I'm guessing you guys are

00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,250
all students from
the academy then?

54
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,583
[Maka]
Why did you do this?

55
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,083
Revenge? A grudge?

00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,750
No, nothing like that...

57
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,125
I have a simpler motive:

58
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,875
experimentation and observation.

59
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,250
That's all a true
scientist cares about.

60
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,791
And, I am a scientist.

61
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,750
Everything in the world is
an experimental test subject...

Of course that includes
myself as well.

Hey, do you feel that, Soul...?

strange is happening.

[Soul]
Huh...? Like what?

66
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,500
[Stein] Your souls' wavelengths
aren't very stable...

67
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,166
What's more, they're quite
different from one another...

68
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,583
I see one soul that is
careless and arrogant

69
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,708
and one that is earnest
and strong-willed.

70
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,708
They appear to be in
resonance, but they aren't.

71

What the hell...?

72
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,875
You mean you can see

73
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,375
the soul of someone
who's still alive...?

74
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,416
In that case,
you must be a meister.

He was able to read the
character of the souls, too...

76

Only the best
meisters can do that.

77

So what...

clearly like that too... Right?

Oh... Well, of course I can!

subject to a more

What does that matter, huh...?

00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,833
Not like you're gonna
see anything interesting...

94
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,000
Far as I'm concerned,

95
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,833
the only soul worth
lookin' at is mine!

[Stein laughs]

97
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,833
Yours is an interesting one.

98
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,708
Your soul is extremely
self-centered

99
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,416
and more than a little bit wild.

100
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,458
It must be rather difficult
to find a partner with a

101
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,041
soul that's compatible
with your own, isn't it?

102
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,916
No more talking.

Hmm?

Ah, yes I see it now.

106
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,750
You must be the
wild one's partner.

107
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,333
You're always willing
to compromise,

108
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
and possess a
very accepting nature.

109
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,916
It makes sense that you're

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,750
the one who's able to cooperate
with his soul's wavelength.

111

Who do you think
you are old man?

112
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,875

the necessary initial data

113
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,083
from all of you...

to begin the experiment.

[Blair] You drink so fast
I can hardly keep up.

118
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,708
Hold on for just a sec...

119
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,166
Pum-Pum-pumpkin,
pumpkin, and up we go!

120
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,083
Blair, you're already
so good at this,

121
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,333
and it's only your third
day working here...

122
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,375
I would have guessed
you've been here forever.

123
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,666
Really? Aww, thank you!

124
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,708
[Blair] You went to the
school today didn't you...?

125
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,666
How'd it go...?

126
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
How were things with Maka?

127
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,041
She ignored me!

128
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,208
Oh you poor thing.

129
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,666
It doesn't matter what I do...

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,375
She just gets angry.

131
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,208
Maka is such a darling girl...

132
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,416
Anyway, your divorce from her

133
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,333
mother was finalized
last month, wasn't it?

134
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,500
It's time to move on.

135
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,916
Let's see if we can
cheer you up... Kay?

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,291
What do I have to
be cheerful about...?

137
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,333
Custody goes to the mother...

138
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,958
My wife... no, no...

139
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,416
My ex wife won't let me
contribute anything.

140
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,166
No alimony or
medical expenses...

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,750
What could I ever
be to Maka now?

142
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,125
I'm a father without
any fatherly duties.

143
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,666
Doesn't mean
you're not her dad...

144
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,250
being a parent is about more
than just money, isn't it?

145
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,666
You should fight for her.

146
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,875
But spending money is a way

147
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,916
of expressing
love too, right...?

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,208
It's just so frustrating not

149
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,791
being able to do
anything for her.

150
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,500
Okay then, think
about it this way...

151
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,333
With all that extra money,
you'll be able to indulge

152
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,125
in your bad habits
more than usual.

153
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,458
Plus, maybe we can even
find you a new wife...!

154
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,666
Let's get going !

155
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,166
I can't do that...

156
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,458
I've never even
thought about remarrying.

157
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,791
This is the worst day

158
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,125
I've had since I was
assigned Stein as a partner.

159
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,875
This is not good,
Blair, really...!

160
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,625
You're depressing the customer.

161
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,666
Meow!

162
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,958
[Stein] You must be
Scythe Meister Maka.

163
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,958
[Black Star]
Ow. My face!

164
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,916
Hmm... Let's see,
Scythe Meister Maka...

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,416
something's familiar
about that name.

166
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,791
If I could just
put my finger on it...

167
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,875
Ah...! Your mother
was a meister,

168
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,000
and you're Spirit's
little daughter, aren't you?

169
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,541
It was an absolute hell...

170
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,125
The time I spent as his partner.

171
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,250
[Soul]
Who's Spirit?

172
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,458
That's what my father

173
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,000
was called before he
became a death scythe...

174
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,500
But I wanna know how
you knew about that.

175
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,625
I can still remember,
even now...

176
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,541
He looked so
peaceful in his sleep.

177
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,708
That guy... he did...
experiments on my body!

178
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,125
He used me as a lab rat
while I was sleeping.

179
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,291
And this went
on for five years!

180
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,208
Wow... for five years?

181
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,083
I can't believe you
didn't notice anything.

182
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,458
Oh, wow...!

183
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,291
You must've been
really stupid back then.

184
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,541
The only strange thing
I noticed was that new scars

185
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,875
would appear on
my body every day.

186
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,000
If my ex wife hadn't
figured out what was going on,

187
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,291
he might still be
doing things to me...!

188
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,041
I can't stand to think
about it even now!

189
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,125
Ah... so...
You are indeed Spirit's

190
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,125
darling little daughter.

191
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,208
And the daughter of the

192
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,875
woman who ended
my greatest experiment.

193
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,333
I wonder what kind
of subject you'd make.

194
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,791
But you were
Stein's weapon partner

195
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,625
for five whole years,
weren't you...?

196
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,041
Doesn't that mean your
soul must have been

197
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,333
compatible with his?

198
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,541
You don't understand...

199
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,916
It doesn't matter...

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,500
If he has any
interest in a weapon,

201
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,291
he can easily master it.

202
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,708
He's much stronger and
smarter than my wife,

203
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,875
sorry, ex wife...

204
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,791
The one who made
me into a Death Scythe.

205
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,083
Stein's mad, but he's a genius.

206
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,166
[Soul] It's just a tap...
we can block it.

207
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,625
Okay.

208
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,166
What... what did he--

209
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,208
[Soul] What the hell
did he do to me?

210
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,958
[Kid]
I don't believe this...

211
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,416
Sure, magic weapons have
valuable physical attack

212
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,750
properties, but primarily,
a meister needs a weapon

213
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,208
to channel his soul
wavelength...

214
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,458
But that man...

215
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,541
he can attack with
his soul directly...

216
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,916
He doesn't need a weapon
to access his power...

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,708
[Death] Yup. The relationship
between meister and weapon

218
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,208
is a lot like the
relationship between

219
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,375
a guitar and an amplifier.

220
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,416
[Death] On its own...
an electric guitar is only

221
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,958
capable of emitting
a small noise.

222
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,083
But when you connect the
guitar to an amplifier,

223
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,583
you enhance the sound waves...

224
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,250
and the result is much
more powerful than before.

225
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,583
[Death]
Witch Hunter.

226
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,291
The technique that Maka
used in the battle against

227
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,708
Sid is a perfect
example of this.

228
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,125
Even if she did fail
with it in the end.

229
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,458
But in Stein's case...

230
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,458
he can use the guitar to
make a huge noise

231
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,375
without an amplifier.

232
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,250
That's incredible.

233
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,500
[Kid] I can only
imagine how

234
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,125
strong he must be when
he does use a weapon.

235
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,250
Let's see here...

236
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,458
How should I begin
my experiment?

237
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,541
[Soul]
What's wrong, Maka...?

238
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,125
Chill out.

239
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
Your soul waves
are completely chaotic!

240
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,250
[Maka bellows]

241
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,125
[Soul]
Wait, Maka.

242
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,750
That was a dumb move.

243
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,041
Maka.

244
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,916
Ahh... You have lovely skin.
Simply lovely...

245
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,916
Where do you think I
should insert the knife first?

246
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,750
Let's see if I can turn your
smooth skin into sandpaper.

247
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,625
[Black Star]
You're about to need a

248
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,458
new pair of glasses, bastard!

249
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,708
How could you've already
forgotten that I'm here?

250
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,208
[Stein]
Easily.

251
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,583
[Black Star] You're not the only
one who can use soul waves

252
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,166
to attack without a weapon!

253
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,625
[Stein]
What?

254
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,666
[Black Star]
Black Star Big Wave!!

255
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,208
Amazing!

256
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,458
He can do that?

257
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,875
[Death] He may
appear to be a child,

258
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,708
but Black Star's soul wavelength
is incredibly large...

259
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,791
And for his age,
he's a genius at using the

260
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,750
direct soul attack
against an opponent.

261
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,916
Still... It won't do him
much good in this fight.

262
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,833
A surprise from
the wild boy.

263
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,583
What the hell is going on?

264
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,875
[Soul] This is useless.

265
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,666
You deflected my soul attack.

266
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,083
[Stein]
Don't you remember how

267
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,916
I checked your soul data
when you first arrived here...?

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,291
When I did that,

269
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,125
I familiarized myself
with your soul's wavelength,

270
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,583
so now I can adjust
mine so that they match...

271
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,041
When the wavelengths
are the same,

272
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,791
they cancel each other out
so your attack is powerless.

273
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,041
You see in the exact
moment you attacked...

274
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,708
We temporarily bonded...

275
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,833
It's like the connection between
a meister and his weapon.

276
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,000
A human can actually
accomplish that?

277
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,250
[Death]
It's only possible if the

278
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,750
human has a soul that is
incredibly flexible...

279
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,333
Stein does... That's one of the

280
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,666
reasons that he is so
difficult to defeat in a fight.

281
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,541
That was a fun experiment,
but now it's my turn.

282
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,416
[Black Star screams]

283
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,875
Black Star!

284
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,000
Leave him alone!

285
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,041
[Soul, Maka and Tsubaki]
Black Star!

286
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,250
This is too much...

287
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,708
They need help. Let's go.

288
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,916
Okay, sure.

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,041
Leeeet's go!

290
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,083
[Death] Kid, you
can't get involved.

291
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,333
This is a test for them
to complete on their own...

292
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,083
Besides, you're a Grim Reaper...

293
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,125
You're not a student here.

294
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,541
[Kid] Alright...

295
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,250
Then in that case,
as of this moment,

296
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,666
consider me enrolled.

297
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,916
Dad, I would appreciate it

298
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,041
if you would register
me for classes...

299
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,000
Liz, Patty.

300
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,041
Yes, Kid.
Yes. Kid.

301
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,291
[Death]
Hey, all of you!

302
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,125
Come back here!

303
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,166
Oh my, my...

304
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,791
[Soul]
What did he do?

305
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,041
Tsubaki... You know that I was
never a man to run away...

306
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,625
...but you shouldn't fight
a battle that cannot be won.

307
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,291
You should go.

308
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,166
Damn you, Stein.

309
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,125
You won't get away with this.

310
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,333
I'll kill you!

311
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,166
Right...

312
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,208
Let's go and get him, Maka.

313
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,166
No way.

314
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,708
Huh...? What's wrong?

315
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,541
This is impossible.

316
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,875
The little girl can
see my soul, huh?

317
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,041
[Maka]
We can't...

318
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,083
...the difference between
us is too great.

319
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:28,916
Hey, come on...!

320
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,375
What's wrong with you, Maka?

321
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,916
[Maka] I can't...
He'll defeat me.

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,833
No, I can't go on like this...

323
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,500
I should die.

324
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,625
We get to do this some more?

325
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,791
[Kid]
How could this happen...?!

326
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,083
Did I really forget to fold

327
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,958
the tip of the toilet paper
into a triangle?!

328
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,666
You don't know if you forgot...?

329
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,750
You always do, so why
would you forget this time?

330
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,833
You really are a
prissy little girl sometimes...

331
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:54,875
Seriously Kid!

332
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,000
[Patty]
Here we go again!

333
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,375
If you don't hurry
and snap out of it,

334
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,958
those kids are gonna die...

335
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,666
Who cares about what
happened with the toilet paper?

336
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,458
[Kid] How could
you not care...?

337
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,875
I'm a failure!
A complete failure...!

338
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,791
What kind of Grim Reaper
am I if I can't even

339
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,541
remember to fold
the toilet paper?

340
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,625
I can't take over
my father's position...

341
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,541
What kind of son am I...?

342
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,333
He'll probably disown me.

343
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,583
That's not true, Kid.

344
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,958
You'll take over,

345
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,583
and you'll probably be
the best Grim Reaper ever...

346
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,291
You know what we should do?

347
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,416
Run right over there to
that creepy laboratory

348
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,250
and save those kids.

349
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,125
Come on! Let's go!

350
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,208
[Kid]
No.

351
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,500
What?! Why?!

352
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,000
What if I didn't fold
the toilet paper?

353
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,041
Something like that could
ruin my life forever.

354
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,791
I can't be defeated
by toilet paper!

355
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,958
If I turn my back on this

356
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,333
I shouldn't be allowed
to live anymore.

357
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,000
Then die already!

358
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,000
[Soul] What's the matter
with you, Maka?!

359
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,458
Why are you just
sitting there? Get up!

360
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,875
[Maka] Shut up!

361
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,041
You wouldn't be acting so
tough if you could see the

362
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,083
shape of his soul like I can!

363
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,791
You're wrong!
I wouldn't care, Maka...

364
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,125
All you saw was
a single soul, right?

365
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,375
You didn't see your future.

366
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,458
You can't give up
before you even fight...

367
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,583
You're supposed to turn me

368
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,333
into the strongest
Death Scythe ever...

369
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,083
You don't want that
worthless father of yours

370
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,541
to outshine us, do you?

371
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,041
Look up and listen to me...!

372
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,625
Do you hear me, Maka?
I'm talking to you!

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,458
Good. Now look over there
and tell me what you see.

374
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,708
He's been waiting patiently for

375
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,083
you to finish
this temper tantrum.

376
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,958
Isn't that so polite
of the good Doctor Stein?

377
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,666
Come on...

378
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,250
If we die, we die cool.

379
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,791
Sorry about that...

380
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,791
I'm better now.

381
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,458
No problem.

382
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,500
Let's go! Soul Resonance!

383
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,083
[Stein thinks] The
resonance of the souls.

384
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,875
Meister and weapon harmonize...

385
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,333
The meister passes 
soul waves to the weapon... 

386
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,666
The weapon then magnifies
the waves and passes them back.

387
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,375
They repeat this process
until they create a soul wave

388
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,000
more powerful than
either is alone.

389
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,250
[Soul] Let's keep this up
until we reach our limit.

390
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,875
Yeah, okay.

391
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,333
[Stein thinks]
I'm impressed...

392
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,791
She can use the Witch Hunter
when she's still so young.

393
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,541
[Stein] You're putting
everything into one hit?

394
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,541
Come on...!

395
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,125
Let's see exactly how much
your souls can handle.

396
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,375
The legendary super skill
of the scythe meister!

397
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,500
Witch Hunter!

398
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,000
[Stein] You can control the
Witch Hunter, too...

399
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,458
But I'm afraid your
skills are too rough.

400
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,500
[Maka]
Soul.

401
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,541
[Stein] You managed
to remain conscious.

402
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,458
Back away...

403
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,291
I won't let you
touch my meister.

404
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,416
In that case,
I'll start with you.

405
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,583
You earned a passing grade.
Good job.

406
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,416
Huh?

407
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,875
Huh?

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,208
[Stein] Your extra lessons
have been completed.

409
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,291
You gave up your own
body to protect your meister...

410
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,125
That's all you need to
earn a pass from me.

411
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,000
Sorry, maybe I wasn't
clear the first time.

412
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,791
I'll say it again... Huh?

413
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,666
This was all planned
out by Lord Death...

414
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,500
He asked me to do him a favor...

415
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,041
He wanted me to help you
with these extra lessons.

416
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,625
But if you were in on it,
why did you kill Black Star?

417
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,291
I bet you think
you're a funny guy, huh?

418
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,958
He's still alive...

419
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,791
But what about Sid the zombie?

420
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,083
Ah, yeah,
sorry about all this...

421
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,416
...back when I was alive

422
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,666
I was definitely a man who
would never tell a lie.

423
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,625
But a lot of things
have changed since then.

424
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,916
Ah, you don't say...!

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,708
Then what the hell
was the point of all this?!

426
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,250
To see if you could
scare us to death?!

427
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,333
Seriously?

428
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,625
[Death] But you're better now
than before, aren't you?

429
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,000
It was just a test...

430
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,375
But I confess it was fun
scaring you kids like that.

431
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,625
You should've seen your faces!

432
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,833
That man is seriously sadistic.

433
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,375
Hey everyone,

434
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm sure you're all tired.

435
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,625
Why don't you spend
the night in my laboratory.

436
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,666
That's a big fat "no"!

437
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,875
I'm still worn out
from last night.

438
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,958
[Maka] I dreamt Stein was using
me in his experiments.

439
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,250
Tsubaki...!

440
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,500
Was Stein a bigger star
than me yesterday?!

441
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,958
[Tsubaki]
Seriously?

442
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,583
I wonder if they've

443
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,666
hired a new teacher
to replace Sid yet...

444
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,916
Hey, maybe your dad
will be our teacher again.

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,791
No! Anyone but him.

446
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,291
[Stein bellows out]

447
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,000
[Stein]
All right class...

448
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,958
Are we ready to get started?

449
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,791
This isn't funny.

450
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,833
This might be the first time...

451
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,958
I've actually wanted
to see my father.

452
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,500
Damn, that guy sure
knows how to get attention.

453
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,333
We're gonna start by
dissecting some frogs.

454
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,375
Should be pretty exciting.

455
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:56,083
♪ ending song ♪
 

456
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,875
[Maka] Ah! I thought
I was gonna die.

457
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,958
[Kid] The best lessons are the
ones you think are real.

458
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,500
[Maka] Humph. Maybe you
should try it, then.

459
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,041
[Kid] In the
next episode, I will.

460
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,208
Running late on the first day

461
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,000
of school and then
plunged into a fight.

462
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,666
At that point it's
all about symmetry.

463
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,166
[Maka] That doesn't seem
to make any sense.

464
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,791
[Kid] Symmetry...
it's the beauty of symmetry.

465
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,125
[Maka] Nope, I still have no
idea what you're saying.

466
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,875
[Kid] On the next episode
of Soul Eater:

467
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,625
The New Student:
Kid's First Day at the Academy.

468
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,500
Will it be an
entrance to remember?

469
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,666
Symmetry is the
truest form of beauty.

470
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,916
[Maka] Hey,
that's where my line goes!
