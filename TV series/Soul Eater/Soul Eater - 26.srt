This afternoon, you'll begin
class on a trial basis.

00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:16,399
I'll come to get you later on,
so be sure you're ready...

You hear me?

Still nothing...

Look, I'm a zombie and
I still teach classes here.

11
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:28,453
So surely someone who's

12
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:31,581
still alive can make
a good student.

[Sid] I was talking to
him for a long time,

18
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:19,356
trying to persuade him to
come out, but he was too afraid.

19
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,733
In the end he told me
that because I was a zombie,

20
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:24,152
he didn't know
how to deal with me.

[Maka]
Okay... I see.

22
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:28,031
[Sid] He's incredibly
depressed...

...and I can't think
what else to do.

some way to connect to

I'd like you to teach him
some things so he can

become more accustomed
to the academy.

and used that blood
to replace Crona's own.

A witch's soul is needed
to turn a magic weapon

into a Death Scythe.

In the end,
perhaps it is the witch

who is responsible for the
evolution of the weapon,

00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:08,306
[Marie]
It's so... sad.

162
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,724
Hi-ya guys!

163
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,768
What're you lame-o's
doing in here?

164
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:12,936
The weather's amazing!

165
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,437
We shouldn't be
locked up in school!

166
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,147
Let's get going!

167
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:19,901
Well. I guess it
does get gloomy

168
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:21,403
without Black Star around...

169
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,279
But fear not,
now that I'm here...

170
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,907
The sun has come out
from behind the clouds!

171
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,617
[Soul]
Read this.

172
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,708
[Black Star] I wish
I'd never been born.

173
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,711
What's so horrible
about a stupid poem?

174
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,592
[Soul] I wish that I'd
never been born.

175
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:48,513
[Crona] I wish that I'd
never been born.

176
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,060
I wish that I'd never
come back to life.

177
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:56,896
What the hell?
Sid, when did you get in here?

178
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,274
[Sid]
Uhh... about Crona...

179
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,526
...there are still some
issues to work out...

180
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,111
But I do think
he'll get accustomed

181
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,487
to the academy eventually.

182
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,906
[Death] Ooh good!
I'm glad to hear it...!

183
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,659
But you're looking
a little pale, Sid...

184
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,995
Do you think you're coming
down with something?

185
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,372
Oh, no...! No, it's nothing.

186
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:17,917
Anyway, Crona is headed for
the Czech Republic right now.

187
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,419
I sent him along as part of

188
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,296
Maka's supplementary lesson.

189
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,715
Why, what's wrong over there?

190
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,009
[Sid] There's a village where
the citizens spend their time

191
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,386
creating figures
known as golems...

192
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,139
Apparently, the oldest golem
made there has suddenly gone

193
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,558
berserk and begun
destroying things...

194
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:36,478
Luckily the damage so
far seems to be light.

195
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,522
Hold on a sec,
are you for real, Sid?

196
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,149
For real about what?

197
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,650
[Death]
When golems are created,

198
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,444
they're programmed
to be protectors...

199
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,529
Whether the damage is
light so far or not,

200
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:49,199
the implications
here are serious.

201
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,701
For a golem to lose control
and begin destroying

202
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,661
things is unthinkable.

203
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:57,374
It may have something to do
with the madness wavelengths.

204
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:58,875
Sid, contact Stein...

205
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,835
This could be very important...

206
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,005
I'd like to hear his
opinion on the matter.

207
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,967
[Maka] So this is
Loof Village, huh...?

208
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,136
They sure do have
a lot of chimneys.

209
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,640
[Soul] That's because they
make so many golems here.

210
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:16,476
There's probably a
kiln in every house.

211
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,773
[Ragnarok] Now let's
eat us some souls!

212
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:22,857
Things have changed.

213
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:24,567
That isn't how
we operate anymore...

214
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,194
We're gonna do things
differently now that

215
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,570
we're students at the academy.

216
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:29,489
[shaking impact]

217
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,663
I wonder where this
supposedly berserk golem

218
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:38,998
that we need to find is hiding.

219
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:41,668
I'll ask the
villagers for details.

220
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:45,880
[Soul thinks] These golem
creators are enchanters...

221
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,350
They use those giant gloves

222
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,602
of theirs to mix
magic into the soil...

223
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:03,773
That's how they create the
figures and bring them to life.

224
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,983
I can't say they look

225
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,110
all that happy to see
us in their village.

226
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,611
[Maka]
Soul...!

227
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:13,450
No one I talked to knows
anything about the golem.

228
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:19,039
They're hiding somethin',
that's for sure.

229
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:21,916
[Giriko]
Hey. You guys.

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,711
I'm guessin' you're here because
you heard about our incident...

231
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:26,046
You're looking for the golem,

232
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,089
the one that's gone berserk?

233
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,593
My name's Giriko...

234
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,845
I'm an enchanter...

235
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,013
I'll show you the way.

236
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:36,723
Just follow me.

237
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,568
[typing on keyboard]

238
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:24,020
What're you doing sitting
here in the dark?

239
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,815
[Marie]
Hey, Stein.

240
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,610
Hey, do you hear me?

241
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,988
Marie.

242
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,031
[Marie]
You okay?

243
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:36,408
[Stein]
Yeah, I'm fine...

244
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,575
What do you need?

245
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,577
[Marie] I have a message
from Lord Death...

246
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:43,164
Apparently the oldest golem in
Loof Village has gone crazy.

247
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,251
Do you have any cups?

248
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,669
I'll make us some tea.

249
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,629
Use those over there.

250
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:53,383
You put tea in a beaker?

251
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,468
Anyway, Lord Death wants to

252
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,471
hear your opinion
on the subject.

253
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,932
Is this incident going to
be a problem for us?

254
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:04,019
Golems are usually constructed
to protect against evil...

255
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,437
It isn't in their programming to

256
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,605
become destructive like this.

257
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,232
I suppose modern technology

258
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:12,819
could be used to create golems
with different programming.

259
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,279
But then again you said this

260
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,781
happened to the oldest golem
they have in the village.

261
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,199
[Marie] You think the
madness wavelengths

262
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,076
have something to do with it?

263
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,496
Even if they do, the order
of events seems strange.

264
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,165
How do you mean?

265
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:26,875
Thankfully as far as we know...

266
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,377
there still haven't been
any incidents related to the

267
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,005
Kishin's revival and madness.

268
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:34,215
It's hard to believe that
the first such incident would

269
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:37,427
involve a soulless creature
like the golem going crazy.

270
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,387
I agree. If anything it seems

271
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,265
like people should be the
first to be affected by it...

272
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,392
So the first event we hear
about shouldn't involve

273
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,394
an object like the golem.

274
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,812
[Stein] That's right...

275
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,856
The golems shouldn't go
berserk until the world is fully

276
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:52,942
enveloped in the
madness of the Kishin.

277
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:57,530
Of course, we still shouldn't
take the situation too lightly.

278
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:58,865
Hold on a sec.

279
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,450
I'm going to the library...

280
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,452
Please ask Lord Death
to give me some time

281
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,537
to consider what's happened.

282
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:10,543
And after all that
work to make us tea!

283
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,380
[Soul]
Hey... how much further

284
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,799
do we have to go until
we reach the golem?

285
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:17,884
[Giriko]
We're almost there.

286
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,679
Yeah right. That's what
you keep telling us.

287
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:21,805
You and your village are

288
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:24,099
really starting to
creep me out, dude.

289
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,392
[Maka]
Be quiet, Soul...

290
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:27,602
There's no need to be rude.

291
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,397
[Giriko] The villagers here make
their living by creating golems

292
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,066
and exporting them
to other countries...

293
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,318
The golems ward off evil

294
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,445
if you put them
by your front door...

295
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,448
You see, everyone is
afraid of the unknown.

296
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,159
So what you're trying
to say now is that we're evil?

297
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,078
Why are you getting
so angry with him...?

298
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:47,038
He never said
anything like that.

299
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,581
[Soul] Not in so
many words maybe,

300
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,500
but that's
what they're thinking.

301
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:54,170
[Goriko] The truth is, we want
to live in peace and quiet...

302
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,213
We don't like it much

303
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:57,924
when strangers
come to our village.

304
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,884
Which is why we try to
adopt the calm of the

305
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,970
golem and avoid conflict.

306
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,890
In the end,
everyone is the same...

307
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,767
We all have evil inside us...

308
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,020
Even someone who
wears a mask of goodness...

309
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,772
can still have pitch
darkness in his heart, you see.

310
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:13,815
[shaking impact]

311
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,525
What was that--?

312
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,530
Oh come on...

313
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:23,241
...if I tell you,
that'll spoil all the fun.

314
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:39,507
Oh well. I suppose there's
no hiding the truth anymore.

315
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,759
Heads up, Soul...

316
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,094
Yeah, I'm already on it.

317
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,228
[Maka] Impossible...!
That's crazy!

318
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,730
[Soul]
What's up, Maka?

319
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,231
[Maka]
What's going on...?

320
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,484
Golems aren't supposed to
be living things, are they...?

321
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,194
But I can sense
a soul wavelength

322
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:00,904
coming from that thing!

323
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,530
You're a young meister,

324
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,615
I take it...

325
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,700
Looks like you
figured it out.

326
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:09,120
[Giriko] I've been waiting
for this moment...

327
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:12,082
...for eight hundred years.

328
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,501
I used techniques I learned
as an enchanter to swap

329
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,378
my memories with
my own children's,

330
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:18,755
passing my brain
through the generations.

331
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:21,675
I've lived out
thirty boring lives.

332
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,134
Eight hundred years...?

333
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:24,594
What are you talking about?

334
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:25,887
[Giriko]
The idea was to store up

335
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,014
enough strength to
take on Death...

336
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,016
...and his precious
organization...

337
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,310
...your DWMA.

338
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,312
But that's all over now...

339
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,649
I think you children might want
to start saying your goodbyes.

340
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,736
What the hell is he?

341
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,322
You see, I don't need a meister.

342
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,701
The golem I created for
myself will do just fine.

343
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,295
[Soul]
This guy's a weapon?

344
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,798
[Maka]
And his golem has a soul.

345
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,467
What else is wrong
with this village?

346
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:11,391
Give up your attack
and turn away right now.

347
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:13,393
If you do continue
to fight me...

348
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,145
...then I'll take your soul...

349
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,521
You got it?

350
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:19,441
[Giriko] My engine isn't
even running yet.

351
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,484
[chainsaw revving up]

352
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,194
[Crona]
Maka!

353
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:25,905
His wavelength is distorted.

354
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,367
It's full of bloodlust.

355
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,452
[Giriko]
Now that I'm good and

356
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:33,079
fired up, there'll
be no stopping us!

357
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,831
[roars]

358
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:36,332
[Giriko]
My soul's wavelength holds

359
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,085
eight hundred years
of anger and hatred...!

360
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,295
I've been wearing this same

361
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:43,173
forced smile on
my face for generations.

362
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:46,760
I had to be nice to stay
under the academy's radar.

363
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:51,181
My life so far has been
nothing but meaningless crap...!

364
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:54,392
Boring... empty... crap!

365
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:59,898
My life is a pointless cesspool!

366
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,816
[Maka cries out]

367
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,902
Maka!

368
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,320
Damn it.

369
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:12,202
[Giriko laughs]

370
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,536
Smiling so long...

371
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,789
I don't remember what
my real self is like...

372
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,416
Tell me who I am again?

373
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,459
Think think think.

374
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,919
It's gotta be in
there somewhere...

375
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,296
Oh yeah. I think
I may have it now!

376
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,506
Everything I am,

377
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,342
everything I've made
myself into, has to go!

378
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,760
It's got to be destroyed!

379
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:31,012
I'll obliterate it all!

380
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:35,100
That golem is too big
for me to fight effectively...

381
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,477
I know I need to
attack it from a distance...

382
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,105
...except I don't know how
to do that using a scythe.

383
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:43,024
[Ragnarok] There is Crona's
Screech Arrow, you know.

384
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,777
Just thought I'd mention that...

385
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,861
Don't know why though...

386
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,904
We're onlookers...

387
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:50,323
No way we're gonna help you...

388
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,826
Not even for three
pieces of candy.

389
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,285
[Crona]
Ragnarok?

390
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,204
Then how 'bout four?

391
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:59,082
[Ragnarok] It was just a
figure of speech...!

392
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:00,959
I don't actually
want any candy at all...

393
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,044
I'm not a baby, you idiot!

394
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,340
Six pieces, okay?!

395
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,342
[Ragnarok] It's not
a matter of number!

396
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:10,552
Fifteen then...!

397
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,804
I'll give you as many
candies as you want!

398
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,514
[Ragnarok]
Really?!

399
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,685
[Ragnarok]
Maka Albarn...!

400
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,478
You know how to
strike a good bargain...!

401
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:23,273
It pays to negotiate,
don't you think?

402
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,152
The first speed setting
doesn't tear him to pieces?

403
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,862
Well that's disappointing.

404
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:33,366
[Ragnarok] Don't
underestimate my black blood!

405
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,452
[Ragnarok cries out]

406
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,289
Goo-bee!

407
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:42,292
[Maka thinks] How did I ever
manage to fight that thing?

408
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,545
I'm real glad he's
on our side now.

409
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,464
Now Ragnarok.

410
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,220
You seem a little shorter
than you used to be.

411
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,430
Sure you can handle this?

412
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:58,641
Quit your worrying... dumbass!

413
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,393
[Crona] Don't hurt
Maka anymore...

414
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:03,605
If something's bothering you,
why not write a poem?

415
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,941
We can write one together, okay?

416
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:14,157
[Crona]
Here we go Maka.

417
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,825
[Maka]
Right.

I wish I'd never come back.
