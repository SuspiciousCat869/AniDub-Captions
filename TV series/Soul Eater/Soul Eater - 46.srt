1
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:45,243
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,454
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,248
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:56,880
So, you've come.

5
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:14,022
Here you are...
it's about time.

6
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:18,068
Sorry to keep ya
waiting, Mifune.

7
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,363
Right, now let's do this thing.

8
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,531
One win one loss so far...

9
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,409
...this will be the
decisive battle.

10
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,206
That's right...

11
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:34,501
I'll show you who the
winner is once and for all.

12
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:45,595
Tsubaki...
you ready to go?

13
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,097
Yes.

14
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,684
Before you lies the
path of the demon...

15
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:53,228
...and the path of the warrior.

16
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:57,023
Tell me, Black Star...

17
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:00,568
Which of these two paths
are you going to follow?

18
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:05,657
♪ opening song ♪

19
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,251
I can't help but wonder
if handing over this

20
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:43,421
Magic Tool is the
right thing to do.

21
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,048
What is Dad planning...?

22
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,551
If he's after all these tools
for some sinister purpose...

23
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,054
I'll have to act.

24
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:53,640
Hey Kid, you should see this!

25
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:54,516
What, Patty?

26
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,060
There...
I wonder what it is?

27
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,168
Fools!

28
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,174
Warrior or Slaughterer...?

29
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:31,177
Showdown:
Mifune vs. Black Star?

30
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,679
Fools!

31
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:35,306
How does it look
out there, Azusa?

32
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,767
I hate to say it,
but not very good.

33
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,061
Our forces on the
front line are advancing,

34
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,564
but they've got a long way to go
before they reach the castle.

35
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,024
Fools!

36
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:47,235
And the relay stations...?
What's the situation there?

37
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,486
Well...

38
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,905
We've succeeded
in taking three of the six...

39
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,532
The stations in the
Middle East, Europe,

40
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,909
and Oceania are
under our control.

41
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,703
They are no longer
operational...

42
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,079
However...

43
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,832
The fight continues at
the other three stations.

44
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:01,833
Fools!

45
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,127
Destroying those
won't be enough...

46
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,922
We'd only delay the spread of
the madness, not stop it.

47
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,466
You're right about that.

48
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:11,760
Until we defeat
the Kishin itself...

49
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,803
...our victory
will be incomplete.

50
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,305
Fools!

51
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,390
Oh...
Lord Death.

52
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,476
Hmmm?

53
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,894
Fool!

54
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:21,978
It's Kid...

55
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,563
...he's returned.

56
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,523
And the Magic Tool?

57
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,610
He's succeeded in retrieving it.

58
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,030
Well...

59
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,407
...some good news, finally.

60
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,786
Tell him to find Joe
in the secret vault

61
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,914
and wait for further
instructions.

62
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:43,875
Hey, Kid, do you
recognize this place?

63
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,210
Yeah...

64
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:47,754
...the so-called contractor
is working in there.

65
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,218
This strange key and the
academy's recent secrecy...

66
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,137
I know they're hiding something.

67
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:00,058
And the answer...

68
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,769
...is behind this door.

69
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:18,702
In our earlier fights,

70
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:21,496
I thought I'd sensed
some potential in you...

71
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:24,249
I guess I was wrong about that.

72
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:25,667
Arrogant fool.

73
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,253
Underestimating me now
could be bad for your health...

74
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,338
Tsubaki!
Ninja Sword Mode!

75
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,840
Right!

76
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,803
Let's go...!
Speed Star!

77
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,350
Here I am!

78
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,895
He's fast!

79
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:52,819
Your soul resonance has
gotten faster than before...

80
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,780
I suppose you have improved
since the last time.

81
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,866
But are you fast enough?

82
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:02,787
Infinite Sword Style...
Get ready!

83
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:12,088
I see through your disguise.

84
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,509
The real one is...

85
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,011
There!

86
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:35,111
Sword Fang!
Horizontal Line attack!

87
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,154
One...

88
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,614
...two!

89
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:40,241
Third strike!

90
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,619
Are you okay?!

91
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:50,126
Pathetic...!
It's barely a scratch

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,837
You have sharp eyes...

93
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,840
Dodging kept you
alive this time.

94
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:58,635
I thought this would happen.

95
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:01,846
I have to use the
Enchanted Sword.

96
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,683
You did a great job, Kid...!

97
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,937
Thanks for taking on that
mission for your old man.

98
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,897
Hi there, cutie!

99
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,650
The Magic Tool please.

100
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,694
Here it is.

101
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,491
Before I hand it over...

102
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:24,703
I want to know everything
that's been going on.

103
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:27,747
What exactly does
this Magic Tool do?

104
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:32,293
...And why do you want it?

105
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,337
Oh... all right.

106
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:35,839
Eh?

107
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,215
Whoa!
Hold on a second!

108
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,050
You've been so secretive
and-and so dodgy!

109
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:40,635
And now you're going to tell
me just because I asked?!

110
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,303
What's going on here?
I don't understand!

111
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,305
Why would you do--

112
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,308
Sorry bout that...

113
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:48,977
But we really couldn't
let just anybody

114
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,353
know what we were doing...

115
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,273
It had to be a
secret operation...

116
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,441
You get it...?

117
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,026
We had to make sure our
plan was kept from

118
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,736
Arachne and the Kishin.

119
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:58,987
Oh really...?

120
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,073
So then we've been
suspicious for no reason?

121
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,909
We're pretty stupid, huh?

122
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:06,953
But now...

123
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:09,039
...we've got the Magic
Tool in our hands...

124
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:12,000
...so we can afford
to be a bit more open.

125
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:17,255
Okay... so tell
me what it does, then.

126
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:20,842
This little guy...

127
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:23,762
...was Eibon's final creation...

128
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:24,929
You see...

129
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:28,516
Eibon, is the last Magic Tool.

130
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,554
Well...
plan says we go in there.

131
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:09,516
But what do we do...?
Just march right in?

132
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,518
I don't know...

133
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,312
Our orders were simply to
infiltrate the castle.

134
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,231
And so we will.

135
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,029
These should make
it a bit easier.

136
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:26,157
Advaaance!
The castle isn't far now!

137
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,867
Let's move!

138
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,708
Advaaance!

139
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,543
Damn DWMA!

140
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,379
They're doing
better than I thought.

141
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:40,880
Mosquito...

142
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,758
What is taking you so long?

143
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,343
Forgive me, my lady...

144
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,138
...it's a tougher fight
than expected.

145
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,015
All right then...

146
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,766
...time for the secret weapon.

147
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,645
Are you sure about this,
Lady Arachne...?

148
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:58,898
Ou--Our own soldiers
are still within range!

149
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,608
Do it anyway.

150
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,320
As you wish.

151
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:06,656
And so...

152
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,035
...it comes to this
in the end, does it?

153
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,676
A new weapon...

154
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,803
One that fires a
compressed version

155
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,556
of the Kishin's
madness wavelength.

156
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,852
One shot from this should be all
we need to win the day.

157
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:37,896
This weapon will
decimate the enemy...

158
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,565
...and anything
else in its path.

159
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:47,072
Prepare yourselves
for utter devastation.

160
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,577
What's that?

161
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:02,212
Now, while he's distracted...

162
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:04,005
Tsubaki...
Enchanted Sword Mode!

163
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,715
Got it!

164
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,477
With the sorry state you're in,
you won't last much longer.

165
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,022
Don't worry...
I plan on making this quick.

166
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,319
Let's go.
Soul Resonance!

167
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,455
Shadow Star!

168
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,881
Such anger and malice...

169
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,009
Is it the path of
the demon then?

170
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:52,929
I'll defeat you...
nothing else matters to me.

171
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:54,514
Think hard before you say that.

172
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,891
You still have a chance
to choose the right path.

173
00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:01,021
Shut up...!
I don't need advice from you!

174
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:17,746
Those eyes...
They look familiar.

175
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:27,088
What the hell's that?!

176
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,381
What do you know...?

177
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:31,634
No one ever told me
the castle could move!

178
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,894
It's been a long time...

179
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,897
...Great Wizard Eibon.

180
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,066
'It's been a long time'?

181
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,275
That means...

182
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,153
Dad and Eibon
do know each other.

183
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,905
Yes, Lord Death.

184
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,657
Sorry, but we don't
have time to catch up...

185
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,869
I want you to lend
me Brew's power.

186
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,788
Why do you need Brew?

187
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,039
Well...

188
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,707
...thanks to the Kishin
and that spider witch...

189
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,460
...we're in a bit of a pickle.

190
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,754
Asura and Arachne?

191
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,091
Father.

192
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,636
Tell me how you and
Eibon know each other.

193
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,513
That's a good question.

194
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:20,517
I guess it might be helpful if
I explained some of our history.

195
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,228
It's been a long time...

196
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:27,732
...but Eibon and I used
to fight side by side.

197
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,527
He was a member of
my elite guard squadron...

198
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,279
He knew the
Kishin, Asura, well...

199
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:37,951
It's hard to believe now...
but they were comrades once.

200
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,786
If he was one of yours...

201
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,330
...then why did he
create the Magic Tools?

202
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,540
Hmmm...

203
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:46,376
Well, there was a lot
going on back then.

204
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,837
What a great explanation.
Thank you.

205
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,422
How should I put it...?

206
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:53,675
Well, he always loved
playing with machines...

207
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:55,468
Yes.
Very helpful.

208
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,429
Ah, jeez...!

209
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,014
Well...

210
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,142
His original goal
was to preserve

211
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,977
and protect order
in the world...

212
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,314
...that's why he began
his research into Magic Tools.

213
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:12,027
Obviously, for any object of
great power, there are always

214
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,322
those who are willing to risk
anything to obtain that power.

215
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,367
And, of course, the more
powerful the object is...

216
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,038
...the greater the danger of it
falling into the wrong hands.

217
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,084
Eibon knew all this,
but he had faith in humanity...

218
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:31,379
...so he continued his
research nonetheless.

219
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,630
Eventually...

220
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:35,133
...his work took on
a more narrow focus...

221
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,178
He began studying
one area exclusively.

222
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,430
It became an obsession.

223
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:43,767
What area was that?

224
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,685
Immortality.

225
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,064
Hello, weird guy!

226
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:51,983
Huh!

227
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,194
What kind of greeting is that?

228
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,032
No...!

229
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:00,617
What's Excalibur doing here?!

230
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,701
Fool!

231
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,371
Why wouldn't I be here?

232
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:05,830
Him again?!

233
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:08,458
Ooh, the funny alien guy!
This should be interesting!

234
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,794
It was not idle
curiosity that led

235
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:13,505
to Eibon's immortality
research.

236
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,801
Indeed...
the true reason...

237
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,886
...is much more tragic.

238
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:22,389
His wife lay dying...

239
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:24,849
Eibon's obsession with
immortality was born

240
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:28,103
because he desperately
sought to save his beloved.

241
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,147
But no matter how great
the inventor or how noble

242
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,693
the cause, transcending death
is an impossible feat.

243
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:39,030
Not even Eibon could hope to
succeed in such an endeavor.

244
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:42,534
But when all seemed lost,
someone appeared by his side,

245
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,953
offering help and
comforting words...

246
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:46,579
That someone was...

247
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,540
...the witch Arachne!

248
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,211
Come on.
Is this guy for real?!

249
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:54,504
I can't be sure...!

250
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,381
It's a heart-rending tale...!

251
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:59,676
But what if it's nothing
but another manipulation?!

252
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,347
I assure you, it's not.

253
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,891
Eibon and Arachne
joined forces...

254
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,686
They combined his
research into immortality

255
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,980
with her research
on Magic Weapons.

256
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,064
And from that...

257
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,609
...the Magic Tool Brew
came into being.

258
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,822
Long ago...

259
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:24,284
I met a man whose eyes looked
exactly like yours do now.

260
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:27,454
He bore the same
star tattoo as well.

261
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:41,843
He showed no mercy,
even to those who deserved it.

262
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,720
You...

263
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:45,430
...you're Star Clan...

264
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,600
You're close to forsaking
the path of the warrior

265
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,643
for the path of the demon.

266
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,020
Oh, please...

267
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:54,189
What use do I have for paths...?

268
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,649
I'm here to win,
plain and simple...

269
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,402
That's all that matters.

270
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:02,322
It's not too late.
Stop while you can.

271
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:06,409
That's enough...
I'm done listening.

272
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:09,329
Yeah, that's a great
story, samurai...

273
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,373
...but why should I care
about some dumb clan

274
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,041
that got itself wiped out?

275
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:16,670
Because the child of a
demon is a demon as well...

276
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,546
Your path has
been decided for you.

277
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,048
Shut up!

278
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:31,184
You have the strength
to be so much more...

279
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:32,560
So why this?

280
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,938
There's nothing greater
in this life than winning...

281
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:37,399
Victory's always
the path I choose.

282
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,651
You're wielding a
double edged sword...

283
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:43,363
It may kill your opponents, but
it's cutting your soul as well.

284
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:49,619
White Star...

285
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:53,498
He was the first man
I ever truly feared.

286
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:57,335
But, feared as he was, he was
not fearless himself.

287
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,170
The thought that he might
one day be defeated

288
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:03,883
made him tremble... it shook him
to the very depths of his soul.

289
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,010
Man...

290
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,845
...for a samurai,
you sure talk a lot!

291
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,388
You're different, though...

292
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:10,557
You've already tasted
defeat, haven't you?

293
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,726
What did you say?!

294
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,231
He strayed from the
path for a reason.

295
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:21,151
Perhaps you should hear it
before you decide.

296
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,321
All right, White Star...

297
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,032
...let's end this.

298
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,204
Your eyes...!

299
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:36,708
You aren't even
human anymore, are you?

300
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:45,008
He couldn't conquer the
darkness inside himself...

301
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,593
What about you?

302
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:50,138
Will you fight that darkness, or
will you become a demon too?

303
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,556
I'm not gonna lose!

304
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,059
He was defeated
because he was weak!

305
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:57,270
I'll show you...!
I'm stronger than him!

306
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,733
You foolish boy.
He wasn't weak!

307
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:19,584
No matter what, he always had
to push harder, reach higher...

308
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,711
He never knew when to stop...

309
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,421
...because of that...

310
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,591
He lost himself...

311
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,344
...the warrior became a demon.

312
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:38,228
I'll ask you again.

313
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:40,146
Which path will you follow...?

314
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,942
That of the warrior...
or of the demon?

315
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,694
Shut up, samurai...

316
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,113
You don't know what
you're talking about.

317
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,034
You're nothing but a fool if you
think you can order me around.

318
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:10,135
You've chosen the demon.
I can do nothing more for you.

319
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,350
Black Star!!!

320
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:25,984
How delicious this power is...

321
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,903
Reduce them to lumps of flesh.

322
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:40,331
You have a habit of popping up
at unexpected times, Exaclibur.

323
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:43,960
Why are you here now?
Did you come to see Eibon?

324
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,003
Hah...!

325
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,921
That's just a bonus.

326
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,883
My reason goes a great deal
deeper than that.

327
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,469
Oh...! You're here to
help us out, then?

328
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:55,055
Fool!
That isn't it.

329
00:21:56,598 --> 00:22:00,060
I've come to observe.

330
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:03,313
Now...
let's begin.

331
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,318
Brew...

332
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:10,320
Unlock.

333
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:21,247
♪ closing song ♪

334
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,752
Energy coefficient stable...

335
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,212
Soul detection radar in
high altitude mode...

336
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,714
Weapons locked and loaded...

337
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:54,007
All system lights are green...

338
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,884
Lord Death, we're ready!

339
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:56,760
Good.

340
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,887
Death City Robot: Fight Mode.

341
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,263
Transform!
Ta-dah!!

342
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:02,766
Well, that was a
fun game, Azusa...

343
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,768
But does this thing
actually transform?

344
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,810
Of course it doesn't!

345
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,104
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

346
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,939
The Miraculous
Coffee Table Flip...

347
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:12,484
Fly, Our Death City Robot?

348
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,902
I told you it doesn't transform.

349
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,945
Oh really?
