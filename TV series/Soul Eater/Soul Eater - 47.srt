1
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:45,243
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,454
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,248
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:58,965
The path of the warrior
or the path of the demon.

5
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:00,884
Think hard, Black Star.

6
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:04,929
You still have a chance
to choose the right path.

7
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,348
Shut up, samurai...

8
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:09,017
You don't know what
you're talking about.

9
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:23,615
You've chosen the demon.
I can do nothing more for you.

10
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,663
Black Star!!

11
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:43,718
Where am I?

12
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:53,311
What the--!

13
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:59,192
Let go!
Let go!!

14
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:06,199
Noooo!!!

15
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:16,167
What am I seeing?

16
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:29,556
♪ opening song ♪

17
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,394
Hey, Free...
can you hear me?

18
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:59,354
Yeah...
loud and clear.

19
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,315
Our line to Medusa has
been cut off for awhile...

20
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,484
I think that might mean...

21
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:06,861
She's dead, right?

22
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:11,324
Probably so...
What do you think, Mizune?

23
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,451
Right...
which means...

24
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,995
Yeah, time to bail out.

25
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,416
Is something wrong, Ox?

26
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:21,251
Uh... no...

27
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,836
Then let's keep moving!

28
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,546
Right...

29
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,760
The Miraculous
Coffee Table Flip...

30
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,638
Fly, Our Death City Robot?

31
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,688
Brew...

32
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,189
Unlock.

33
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,238
It begins.

34
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,581
What's it doing?

35
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,963
It's getting bigger and bigger!

36
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:10,592
Look closely, everyone...

37
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:13,303
This is Eibon's
ultimate creation.

38
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:16,848
The Magic Tool Brew
is assuming its true form.

39
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:34,491
Lord Death...
The tool is ready.

40
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:36,409
Thank you, Eibon.

41
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,662
Dad... what exactly
is Brew's power?

42
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:41,289
What does it do?

43
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,041
Brew is a unique device...

44
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,460
Its power lies in
its ability to take

45
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,713
whatever form its
wielder most desires.

46
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:50,507
How is that possible?

47
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,634
It becomes tuned
to the wielder's soul...

48
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:55,261
Brew measures the strength
of that soul's desire...

49
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,222
...and alters itself
accordingly.

50
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,766
And therein lies its
most fearsome power...

51
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:04,354
If used the wrong way, Brew
could destroy the entire world.

52
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:07,190
Brew's power terrified
even its creator...

53
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:09,693
To protect it from falling
into the wrong hands,

54
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:13,405
he locked the device and bound
his own soul to the key.

55
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:14,572
Which means...

56
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,116
...the key to the Magic Tool...

57
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,785
...is Eibon's soul itself...

58
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:20,912
Without the presence
of its creator...

59
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,707
Brew's power can
never be activated.

60
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,543
Lord Death...
as you predicted,

61
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:31,381
my research led to nothing but
grief and sorrow in the end.

62
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,678
The death of friendship...

63
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:41,099
Betrayal...
involvement with witches.

64
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:49,858
And the loss of
the one I loved most.

65
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,070
But now at least...

66
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:58,450
I can make amends for my
misdeeds by helping you.

67
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,285
Do you remember
what you said to me...

68
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:02,871
...all those years ago?

69
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,748
Even if you
triumph over death...

70
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,876
...you'll find nothing
but grief and sorrow.

71
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,295
For the first time...

72
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:12,881
...I understand what you meant.

73
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,175
Eibon...

74
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:29,022
Save the world.

75
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,692
Fool!

76
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,747
Lord Death...
do you copy?

77
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,878
We have a situation...

78
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,089
The enemy has a new weapon.

79
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,716
At this rate, we can't
hold on much longer!

80
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,886
Looks like we're gonna
need to speed things up a bit.

81
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,807
I never seem to know what
to say in situations like this.

82
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,934
But you just said
something, didn't you?

83
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,310
That's true, I did...

84
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:08,561
Okay...
I'll shut up.

85
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:10,814
Yeah...
so will I.

86
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,317
The tool takes the form
of its wielder's desire...

87
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,070
What will it become
for my father?

88
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,154
All right...!

89
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:21,866
Let's get this
party started, shall we?

90
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,878
What's happening?

91
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:43,722
Dad?!

92
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,619
Death City is moving!

93
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:23,136
So, you've shown up again.

94
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:24,637
Why are you here...?

95
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,097
Well...?

96
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:29,142
What, are you trying to get
back into my good graces?

97
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,563
I'm here to bid you farewell.

98
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:35,273
What?

99
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,400
Don't you understand?

100
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:39,402
Understand what?

101
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,738
That you've finally lost.

102
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,156
Oh, yeah?

103
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:46,159
Even now...
you are surrounded by warriors

104
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,370
who have lost the
will to survive...

105
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:51,164
Soon they'll devour you.

106
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:54,959
You are deep inside
the Enchanted Sword...

107
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:57,045
This is the final
destination for those

108
00:09:57,128 --> 00:10:00,882
whose souls have been
irrevocably shattered by fear.

109
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,133
What I saw...

110
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,969
Those images from earlier...

111
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:10,392
Farewell, weakling...
We shall not meet again.

112
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:13,144
You bragged that you
would surpass God...

113
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:16,481
Instead, look where
you've ended up.

114
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,781
Hold it...
We aren't done.

115
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,744
Black Star...

116
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,580
You're lost in a
world of darkness...

117
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:36,543
Soon, it will swallow your soul
and you'll be gone forever.

118
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,921
All I can hope for you
is a peaceful end.

119
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:59,190
I suppose you're
not lost after all.

120
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:01,443
You chose the
path of the warrior.

121
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,361
Path of the warrior?

122
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,114
What's this?

123
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,951
You will never see my tears.

124
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,202
You get it...?

125
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,371
These tears belong to
those fallen soldiers.

126
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:16,416
I'll save them from
their fear and sorrow...

127
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,169
I will take up their burdens.

128
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,796
Foolish boy!

129
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,507
I told you,
you've already lost...

130
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,634
Despair is all
that remains for you...

131
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:28,219
...and you can
never change that.

132
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,138
That's where you're wrong!

133
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,098
I haven't lost anything...

134
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,892
I don't run from fear...

135
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,602
I stand and face it.

136
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:41,399
The day I lose
will be the day I die.

137
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,527
I won't be devoured,
and I won't give up...

138
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:48,490
You will never defeat me!

139
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:55,455
You're going to fight
for the fallen warriors...?

140
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:58,750
Those left behind on the path?

141
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,794
Nakatsukasa...

142
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:04,172
I'm going to show
you a new world.

143
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,841
Like none you've ever seen!

144
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:24,901
My family's souls...
We're all with you now.

145
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,372
Mifune...
let's get something straight...

146
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:41,710
The path I choose isn't that of
the warrior or the demon...

147
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,967
You don't know this path...

148
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,178
You've never seen
it before, samurai.

149
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:56,182
My path...! And nobody
else's you GOT me!

150
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,435
You reject warrior and demon...

151
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:01,187
...and choose a path
of your own making.

152
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,859
Let's see it...
Show me this path.

153
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:16,930
Mifune.

154
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:24,229
Go on, then...
One stroke will finish me.

155
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:27,315
You're giving up samurai...?
Already?

156
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,360
Isn't there somebody you're
still sworn to protect...?

157
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:31,861
And don't forget...

158
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:35,615
Tsubaki made you a pretty
good offer the last time we met.

159
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,204
You care about helping children,
and you have incredible skill...

160
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,665
You'd fit in well
at the academy...

161
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:46,001
Why not become
a teacher instead?

162
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:49,254
What...?
A teacher at the academy?

163
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:57,345
You coming?

164
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,680
Don't worry...

165
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:01,099
...we'll find that little
witch of yours first.

166
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:22,537
Mosquito's putting up a
better fight than I expected.

167
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,040
That's interesting, I would've
thought you'd be a bit upset.

168
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,166
What? Why?!

169
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:27,417
Come now...

170
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,627
...surely you've noticed
what's been happening.

171
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,422
Spit it out already!
What're you talking about?!

172
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,674
They've been attacking
indiscriminately...

173
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:38,595
In other words, Arachnophobia
doesn't care if you die.

174
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,930
What the hell...?!
Seriously?!

175
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,640
Seriously.

176
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:45,977
Damn that witch!

177
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,566
There's no hope for you now...
Lady Arachne planned well...

178
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,194
We just sacrifice some
of our own forces...

179
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:58,031
...and in doing so, we ensure
that victory will be ours.

180
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,869
Next target sighted!

181
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:06,081
This is it...
This is where we die.

182
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,628
Fire!!!

183
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:19,094
What the--?!

184
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,229
What is that?

185
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,083
What the heck is that?!

186
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:57,799
Phew!

187
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,885
We made it...
but just barely.

188
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:04,472
What...

189
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,182
...is that?

190
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,771
This was Dad's wish.

191
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,691
All those years ago, he bound
his soul to Death City

192
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:17,986
in order to seal
the Kishin away.

193
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,947
That binding kept
him trapped in the city.

194
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:28,538
There is nothing he
desired more than this...

195
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:31,374
To come here
to this battlefield.

196
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:39,883
And Brew made that possible...
by mobilizing all of Death City!

197
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:44,179
All right then...
let's see what this baby can do!

198
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,766
Mosquito...
launch a counterattack.

199
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:51,102
Understood, my lady.
Launching counterattack.

200
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,072
That one can move too?!

201
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:03,573
Fools!

202
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,537
What...?!
This is insanity!

203
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,706
This can't be happening.

204
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,792
This is so cool!

205
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,421
Let's dance!

206
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,299
Well, here goes nothin'!

207
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:51,746
Why can't I swat that damn bug?!

208
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,374
Careful, Dad...!
Don't kill us!

209
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,633
Take this, bug!

210
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,522
And this!!

211
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,529
Nice try, Reaper!

212
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,784
Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot!

213
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:41,046
Hot! Hot!
Really, really hot!

214
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,506
Dad, what're you doing?!

215
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,220
Eye Poke!!

216
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:06,905
Special Attack...
Coffee Table Flip!!

217
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,327
Impossible!

218
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,828
Fools!

219
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,252
Now it's my turn.

220
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,843
So this is what a
Death Scythe can do...?

221
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,762
That's incredible!

222
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,526
Target located...
Mapping it now.

223
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,112
The upper level of the
castle near the middle...

224
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,988
That's where the Kishin is.

225
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,616
Thank you, Azusa.
Good job...

226
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,953
Same to you students...
you've performed well today.

227
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,997
Hold on tightly!

228
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,837
It's not over yet!

229
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:09,467
Die, Reaper!!

230
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,906
Playtime's over!

231
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:44,961
What now?!

232
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:47,881
No!

233
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,940
Hm.

234
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,401
He swallowed the Kishin whole!

235
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:21,247
♪ closing song ♪

236
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,752
Dad ate the Kishin!

237
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:49,836
Hey, hey...!

238
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,338
Doesn't that mean
it's all over...?

239
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:52,714
Is this the end of the show?

240
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:54,507
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

241
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:57,135
The audience is never gonna
buy that kind of ending!

242
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,012
But the Kishin's all eaten!

243
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:00,305
What else is left to do?

244
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:01,431
Well...

245
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,516
...it's a bit...
complicated...

246
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,435
So it's not over?

247
00:24:05,518 --> 00:24:07,812
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

248
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,773
Lord Death Wields
a Death Scythe...

249
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,524
Just One Step
from Utter Darkness?

250
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:15,153
Oh goodie!
There's still more to come!
