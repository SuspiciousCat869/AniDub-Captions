How can you fight

24
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:15,300
[Death] Our struggle
against witches

25
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,666
has been going on
for centuries.

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,466
Over the years, witches have

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,200
come up with an
number of new spells.

28
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:25,066
But for every new spell meisters
and weapons have developed

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,466
new ways of countering them.

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,400
For instance,

31
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,300
in order to detect
and hunt down witches,

32
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:34,600
meisters were born who
had the ability to sense souls.

33
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:36,400
But now the witches can

34
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,766
counter them by
using Soul Protect...

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,366
So what we have to do
now is develop a new technique.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,333
The only way to do
that now is to Kishinize.

37
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,500
[Kilik]
What?

38
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,666
[Death] I suppose there's no
point in hiding it anymore.

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,133
If you shut the lid on
something that stinks,

40
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:57,633
all you're really doing
is hiding the bad smell.

41
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,600
To get rid of it, you have to

42
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:03,600
open the lid back
up and dive in.

43

This is the story of a man...

His name was Ah-shura.

53
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,432
Asura kept himself covered,

54
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:09,232
wrapping his face
in long scarves

55

and layering five shirts
on top of each other...

56
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:14,098
He wasn't very good at
trusting other people...

57
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:17,265
He didn't confide in anybody.

58
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,498
He was basically a big ball

59
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:21,532
of paranoia wrapped up
in a dozen scarves.

60

Tell me what happened
with the eastern witches.

Sir, by the time we arrived...

62
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:34,198
Asura had slaughtered them all.

63
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,098
Asura was a member
of my personal squad.

64
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:38,398
He was by far the best

65
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:41,465
and strongest of all
the Eight Guardians.

66
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,165
However, he was also the

67
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:44,498
most frightened one
of them all...

68
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:47,265
...always terrified
of something.

69
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,398
Asura became
obsessed with power...

70
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:52,265
Eventually, he broke our most
sacred rule and began

71
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:55,332
collecting the souls of humans.

72
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:04,232
And thus, because of him...

I told you he was
a frightened man...

79
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:24,198
He was terrified of
his partner as well.

00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,098
Sensing stuff's is the only
thing you're half decent at.

163
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,332
[Maka] You really know
how to piss me off.

164
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:19,265
What... what...?

165
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:20,198
Professor Stein!

166
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:21,432
Yeah.

167
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:23,398
I've got something...

168
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,698
It's a soul just
beyond those shadows.

169
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,332
There's someone there.

170
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,565
I know that soul...

171
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,565
I'm sure of it...

172
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:36,965
That nasty,
despicable feeling...

173
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,165
...Papa!

174
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:42,698
I'm not nasty... or despicable.

175
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,665
How did you manage to escape
from the trap they set up there?

176
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,998
When it comes to chasing a
woman no one's faster than I am.

177
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,165
I shoulda guessed...

178
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,032
...it is a relief to
see you, though...

179
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:52,965
I wasn't sure how much I'd

180
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:56,298
be able to do without
my weapon around.

181
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,332
What do we got...

182
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,198
Are they up ahead?

183
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,065
Uh-huh...

184
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:03,165
...lying in wait for us.

185
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,398
Listen up...

186
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:07,298
From this point forward,

187
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,165
there's no telling
what could happen...

188
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,498
It'd be best for you weapons

189
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,098
not to return to human
form during the battle.

190
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:16,132
When you're vulnerable a single
blow could be the end of you.

191
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,165
Right!

192
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:19,198
--Uh... okay.
--Yeah!

193
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:22,332
[Black Star] Why're they sitting
up there waiting for us...?

194
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,998
I thought they were on
their way to the Kishin.

195
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:28,932
No. They would've
left some behind for protection.

196
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,532
[Black Star] Hey did
you hear something?

197
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,098
Hear what?

198
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:37,498
[footsteps]

199
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,232
Yeah, I heard that.

200
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,732
It sounds like footsteps to me.

201
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,498
[Black Star[ So they're finally
showing themselves...

202
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,165
Who's it gonna be?

203
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,665
[Stein] Someone able
to defend against

204
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,532
and defeat multiple
opponents...

205
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:55,598
Someone who can attack
several people simultaneously...

206
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:58,065
Someone who will make
absolutely sure not to

207
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:00,965
let us through, no matter what.

208
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:13,298
How lovely to see you all again.

209
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:26,930
[Stein] All right, here's how I
think it's going to break down.

210
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:28,897
For the most part,

211
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,997
we can anticipate
our enemies' moves...

212
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,164
The first roadblock is
going to be Medusa.

213
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,597
The Demon Sword
will be the second barrier.

214
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,997
After that,
the remaining two will

215
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,630
be making their
way to the Kishin.

216
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:45,997
The werewolf Maka
and the others fought

217
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,230
before is immortal...

218
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:48,897
...so he'll be in
charge of protecting

219
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,297
the black blood at all costs.

220
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,164
Now then,
this is what we will do.

221
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,897
I'll stay here and
keep Medusa busy.

222
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,164
While I'm distracting her,

223
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:02,064
I want the three of you to run
past her as quickly as possible.

224
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,297
Kid, you're the most mobile
of our little army,

225
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,930
so you continue on ahead of us

226
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:08,230
after the two who are
heading for the Kishin.

227
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,330
Understood.

228
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:12,097
Black Star, you'll be keeping
the Demon Sword busy

229
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,664
so Kid and Maka can get through.

230
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:17,264
Since you can attack directly
with your soul wavelength,

231
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:19,664
you can do the most
damage to the Demon Sword.

232
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,697
Yeah!

233
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,964
Finally, Maka...

234
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:23,297
You run on past Medusa and

235
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,230
the Demon Sword to
catch up with Kid...

236
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:27,130
Then you destroy
the black blood.

237
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,797
[Maka]
Right.

238
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,330
[Stein] There's just
one last thing...

239
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:33,164
I want you all to
make me a promise.

240
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:36,764
I want you to
promise not to die.

241
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,197
Can you do that?

242
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,864
--Uh-huh.
--Yes sir!

243
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:42,730
Holding a strategy meeting
right in front of your enemy...?

244
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,797
Is that really the best idea?

245
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,897
Ah, well...
I guess we'll just have

246
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,897
to take our chances, won't we?

247
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,730
[Medusa] Always so
stupidly confident...

248
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,164
...aren't you?

249
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:54,697
Shall we start the party then?

250
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,630
Nake... snake...
cobra... cobra...

251
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,930
Nake... snake... cobra... cobra.

252
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:00,964
Here we go.

253
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,797
Don't worry about getting
past her right away.

254
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,864
Wait for a good opening
to present itself...

255
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,897
Stay calm and collected.

256
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,764
Here goes.

257
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,664
[Medusa]
Vector Arrow!

258
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,564
Times... three!

259
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:15,697
She's picked a perfect spell

260
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,864
for keeping
multiple attackers at bay...

261
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,164
And it's more
powerful than last time.

262
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:24,864
If you get scared,
go to sleep.

263
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:25,930
[Liz]
Yeah, okay.

264
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:27,797
I'm not gonna hold back!

265
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,897
Now...! Enchanted Sword Mode!

266
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,897
[Tsubaki]
Right!

267
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,697
[Black Star bellows]

268
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,130
It's time to punish you...

269
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:35,764
Impudent boy!

270
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,297
[Kid]
Death Slide!

271
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,964
We're through!

272
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:44,097
Maka...! Black Star!

273
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,664
I'm going to keep moving!

274
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:46,297
Tsubaki!

275
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,864
[Tsubaki]
Right!

276
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:51,097
[Black Star bellows]

277
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,597
Why, you...!

278
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,664
Yahoo!

279
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:56,864
Two of them made it through.

280
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,197
Enchanted Sword Mode off.

281
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,864
We've got somewhere to be.

282
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,730
[Soul] Maka...! Hurry up
and go after them.

283
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:04,764
Yeah.

284
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:07,664
All vectors to Maka!

285
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:08,597
[Maka thinks]
I remember this...

286
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,330
I've seen how this spell
works once before.

287
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,830
So I already know the
path that I have to take.

288
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,964
Right down the middle.

289
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,297
[Stein thinks]
The vector arrows radiate

290
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,264
from their power
source, Medusa...

291
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,297
If Maka is going to get
past them, her best bet is

292
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,264
to go through
the gap in between.

293
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,097
But in that position,

294
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,064
she'll be surrounded
by the arrows...

295
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:30,297
A moment of hesitation,

296
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,930
and she could die.

297
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:32,997
And if Maka doesn't get

298
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,630
there before
the arrows close in,

299
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:36,130
she won't have a chance.

300
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,297
Focus on your speed, Maka.

301
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,330
[Maka]
I have to run faster!

302
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,797
Think you can't be afraid
of what you can't see, huh?

303
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,830
[Maka thinks]
The arrows sound close.

304
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,564
Maka!

305
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:03,297
[Maka thinks] Damn it... Of
course I'm imagining the worst!

306
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,697
And now the fear is beginning
to weigh down my legs.

307
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,597
No...! The fear should
make me run faster!

308
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,964
Faster!

309
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,197
You aren't going to beat me!

310
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:23,230
You aren't going
anywhere, girl! Nice try!

311
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:25,130
[Stein]
Soul Force!

312
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,697
It's just you and
me now, Medusa.

313
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:40,264
Good! Let's keep going.

314
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:41,864
[Soul]
Yeah.

315
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,236
[Medusa]
I miscalculated...

316
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:50,269
To think that I let all
three of them get away.

317
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,802
But as long as I stop you
from getting any further,

318
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,702
my plan will still succeed...

319
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:55,669
Those three are just children.

320
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,769
They should be taken
care of quickly enough.

321
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:01,669
[Stein] I wouldn't
underestimate those children.

322
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:04,002
Didn't you learn anything
about our students' abilities

323
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,569
during your little
stint at the academy...?

324
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,569
Or are you just a fool?

325
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,769
No, I think you're the fool.

326
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,269
We'll see... I wonder how

327
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:15,736
they're going to do
against the Demon Sword.

328
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,302
[Kid bellows]

329
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:21,536
[Crona]
Huh?

330
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,269
[Ragnarok] Hey, did something
with four wheels, two legs,

331
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:25,969
and two arms just blow past us?

332
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:27,302
Hmm.

333
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:30,069
[Death Scythe] Medusa...
I must admit I always

334
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,736
loved seeing you
in your nurse's outfit.

335
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,936
Although the thought of

336
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,336
seeing you out of it
was more exciting,

337
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,602
especially if
I was taking it off.

338
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,702
You know I was
dancing with her tonight,.

339
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:40,769
Yeah, I saw that.

340
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:42,769
Just rub it in, why don'tcha!

341
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,802
[Medusa chuckles]

342
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,036
Boys, boys, must you fight...?

343
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:47,969
It embarrasses me so.

344
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,869
Does it...? How impolite of us.

345
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,569
[Medusa] My, my... That's quite
a large soul you have...

346
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,969
Perhaps I would be willing
to dance with you again.

347
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,169
Thanks, but I'm gonna
pass on that one...

348
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,869
I don't think you're
really fit for dancing now.

349
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,069
My feet...! What is this?

350
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:10,202
Those are Soul-thread Sutures...

351
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,669
The soul wavelength I blasted

352
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:13,902
into you a second
ago is still there...

353
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,236
As we speak it's working its

354
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,102
way through your body
like an electric charge.

355
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:22,702
I used the wavelength like

356
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:25,602
a thread to sew your
feet to the ground.

357
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:28,336
How can you control your
soul wavelength that precisely?

358
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,102
A weapon can have
more than one use.

359
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,902
He doesn't just amplify
a meister's wavelength...

360
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,302
It's also possible
to increase the

361
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,602
accuracy of wavelength control.

362
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:37,669
So then it's a technique that

363
00:17:37,702 --> 00:17:40,636
only powerful meisters and
weapons can pull off.

364
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:41,769
Medusa...

365
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,036
Listen closely to
what I have to say.

366
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,769
I'm the only Death
Scythe at the DWMA.

367
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:49,569
If I allow the Kishin to
revive under my watch,

368
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,736
I won't be able to show my
face to any of the other

369
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,669
Death Scythes around the world.

370
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:54,869
[Medusa]
Your point?

371
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:55,969
The point I'm making...

372
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,902
The point he's making
here is that we're going to

373
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:59,802
beat you no matter what, right?

374
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,302
Hey...! Not cool, Stein...

375
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:04,336
That was my big line!

376
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,769
Medusa...

377
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:08,002
Consider yourself fired.

378
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:10,902
Now!

379
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:15,036
Sutures, go!

380
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:18,536
[Stein]
It's over!

381
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,369
You're not going to get any

382
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,736
closer to me
than that, Professor.

383
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,636
Vector Plate!

384
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:29,436
What did you do?

385
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:32,102
[Medusa] Anything that's on top
of one of my vector plates will

386
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:35,636
be sent flying in the
direction the arrow is pointing.

387
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,636
Of course, the plates work on me
as easily as they do on you.

388
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,136
Vector Plate!

389
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:48,769
As you can imagine,

390
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:52,802
I'm not eager to fight
you up close anymore.

391
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:53,969
Damn! Not again!

392
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,036
Now... come back this way.

393
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,602
Sutures.

394
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:02,002
You sewed your own body
to keep yourself in place!

395
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:05,736
But...How can you fight this
when you're all sewed up...?

396
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,069
Light Serpent!

397
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:10,002
Removal.

398
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:11,636
Good one! You timed that just

399
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,602
right so you could use
the plate to your advantage.

400
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,136
[Medusa]
Vector Storm!

401
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:21,936
[Death Scythe]
Stein!

402
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:28,636
I have a thousand snakes inside
me that are under my control...

403
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,136
They won't let any
easy prey like you escape.

404
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,769
"Not eager to
fight me up close."

405
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:34,636
Yeah, right.
When you cause pain,

406
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:36,602
you love to see it up close...

407
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,069
Masquerading as a school nurse

408
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:40,136
was just another
one of your charades.

409
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,202
You're nothing but a liar.

410
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:44,302
I'm afraid you're
wrong about that.

411
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:47,036
"Why don't you join me?"

412
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,236
You remember that, don't you...?

413
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,969
While we were dancing?

414
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,269
I really meant what
I said at the party...

415
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:54,702
I'm not lying when
I say that I want you...

416
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,869
You're a scientist
just as I am...

417
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:59,702
We could watch the
world progress together.

418
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,836
What do you say,
Franken Stein...?

419
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,169
Think about my offer...

420
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,169
I'm not asking
you as an instructor...

421
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,036
...but as a man of science.

422
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,036
[Death Scythe] Hey...
what's wrong, Stein?

423
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,602
Vector Plate.

424
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:16,269
[Medusa] Don't you see,
Professor Stein...

425
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:19,769
The vector plates around
you all point to me.

426
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,136
There's no point in resisting.

427
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,069
I always get what
I want in the end.

428
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,102
There is no escaping from me.

429
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:29,169
[Crona]
This isn't good...

430
00:20:29,202 --> 00:20:31,802
We let someone get through
without even fighting.

431
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:33,102
We're going to
get in trouble again...

432
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:34,869
I can't deal with that.

433
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,736
[Black Star]
Are you the Demon Sword?

434
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,836
You don't look like you can

435
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:40,269
put up a very
good fight to me...

436
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:44,602
Defeating you isn't gonna
enhance my reputation at all.

437
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:49,302
Seriously, dude,
you look pretty messed up.

438
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:51,202
Are you okay?

439
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:58,136
Oh well, who cares about you
and your problems anyway...

440
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,336
The important thing is that
I'm gonna kick your ass.

441
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,636
[Tsubaki]
Be careful Black Star.

442
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,702
Black Star. Hold up a second!

443
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:10,102
[Black Star] You made it here
quick for someone so slow.

444
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,202
[Maka thinks]
The sword.

445
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,236
Stand back and
let me handle this.

446
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,702
What? Why?

447
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:17,002
What are you doing, Maka...?

448
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:17,802
That's not the plan.

449
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:19,569
Professor Stein
wanted Black Star

450
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:21,269
to take care of the
Demon Sword, remember?

451
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:22,236
Listen to her, she's right.

452
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,336
Our attacks don't work
against that thing.

453
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,402
What're you thinking...?

454
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:28,069
I'm not gonna let you
take the spotlight off me.

455
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,169
Come on now. Keep acting cocky

456
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:37,136
like this and you're
gonna get yourself killed.

457
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:43,102
[Maka thinks] This is my
chance for revenge.

458
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,936
A good student like you, Maka?

459
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:48,236
Disobeying a direct order
from a professor?

460
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,669
What...? Teen rebellion?

461
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:52,902
Just stand back.

462
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,302
[Black Star] Alright, if that's
how you're gonna be...
