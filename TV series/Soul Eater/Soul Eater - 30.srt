You guys have heard of the
"Runaway Express," right...?

12

The high-speed train that runs

through the desert without
following any tracks?

[Patty]
Hot!

15
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,788
Oh yeah, the one that's run

16
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,582
continuously for over
a hundred years now?

17

[Kid]
That's right.

18
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,461
A century's a long time to
run without maintenance.

19
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:42,712
How does it work?

20
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:45,173
[Kid] Apparently it's
powered by a Magic Tool.

21
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,591
What's that?

22
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:48,802
[Kid] A device that could cause
wide-spread destruction

if used by the wrong people.

24

It seems that Arachnophobia

25

[Liz] Kid,
I thought that as a

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,547
Grim Reaper you were
immune to sunburn...

35
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,800
What's the point of wearing
that silly outfit in this heat?

36
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,385
It sets the mood...

37
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,138
Besides, it keeps the lines in
my hair partially hidden...

38
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,514
No matter how
many times I dye it,

39
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,433
those damn lines
keep coming back...

40
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,435
Quite annoying.

The train'll arrive
any minute now.

excited about that.

[Patty]
How come?

48
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,115
That train has been operating

00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:53,825
on schedule for
the last hundred years.

50

Never a second late
or a second early.

51
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:58,329
How could I not be excited
about seeing such a perfectly

52
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,373
executed mode of transportation?

53
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:02,667

is famous, I guess.

where are your manners?!

Aren't you gonna answer us...?!

62
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:29,861
When someone says 'hello',
you answer, okay?!

63
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:31,571
Calm down.

at us like that, huh...?!

all the sand, Patty...!

68
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:48,046
Why don't we sit here
and play for awhile?

69
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,882
[Patty] Yeah! I'm gonna
build a sandcastle!

70
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:56,221

According to the schedule,

71
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:58,890
the train should
be arriving soon.

72
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:04,104
Is that why you're here...?

Wow...! Looks great, Patty!

I don't know what it is,
but there's something not

quite right about
that kid up there.

I still don't see anything!

80

At this rate, it's going to
miss its scheduled arrival.

81
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,018
So, its perfect punctuality

82
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,687
was nothing more
than a rumor...

83
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:51,192
How disappointing.

can be tourists too...

00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,556
I'm a sitting duck up here...

165
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,401
There's no sign of the guy...

166
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,612
He must've gone up to the front.

167
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,324
[Fisher King laughs]

168
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,576
All I have to
do is pull this lever,

169
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,163
and it's "bye-bye" to anyone
in the cars behind me!

170
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,291
[Fisher King laughs]

171
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,753
All right, where'd
the guy run off to?

172
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,004
Got 'im!

173
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,340
[Fisher King] You move
fast, skateboard kid.

174
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:06,716
But that won't keep you

175
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,552
from blowing up along
with this half of the train!

176
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:10,428
Damn it...!

177
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,347
He's going to uncouple the cars!

178
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,432
[Fisher King laughs]

179
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:20,146
That was close!

180
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,231
I forgot that I had to

181
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:22,899
watch for attacks
from the air, too.

182
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:25,610
But no one catches
the Fisher King!

183
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:37,330
Avoiding that attack landed

184
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,958
me on the wrong
side of the train!

185
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,836
Fisher!

186
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,005
This guy's a special
kind of stupid.

187
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,923
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

188
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,508
Seriously!

189
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,010
[Fisher King]
Damn!

190
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,346
And...Fisher!

191
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,098
Well... see ya around!

192
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,893
Liz, Patty!

193
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,061
[Liz]
Connect!

194
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,146
[Patty]
Connect!

195
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,272
[Fisher King]
What the--?

196
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:05,275
[Liz and Patty cry out]

197
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,655
We're flying!

198
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,323
How cool!

199
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,410
[Fisher King]
Damn it!

200
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,373
[Fisher King]
I can taste victory...!

201
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:24,210
No one's getting into
the engine room ahead of me!

202
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:25,337
[Liz]
Where's he going?

203
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,130
[Kid]
Liz, Patty.

204
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,176
[Fisher King]
Fishing Rod Launcher!

205
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,139
Die, die, die, die, die,

206
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,307
die, die, die, die, die!

207
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,103
Geez. This guy is stupid,
ugly, and a bad shooter!

208
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:45,065
[Fisher King]
Die, die, die, die, die!

209
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:50,403
Hey!

210
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,210
[Fisher King]
Damn...

211
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:06,920
That's it!

212
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,964
That's the train's power source!

213
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,342
The Magic Tool...

214
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,886
Known as The Eternal Spring.

215
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:15,929
I've got it!

216
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,764
You're too late!

217
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,809
[Kid bellows]

218
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,979
[Fisher King]
You can't have it...

219
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,774
It belongs to
the witch Arachne.

220
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,882
[Kid] This is what we
came here for...

221
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:56,052
After it's gone, the Runaway
Express will sleep.

222
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,777
This is an evil tool...

223
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,405
Just holding it disgusts me.

224
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:16,948
[Fisher King laughs]

225
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,283
I see you're a typical

226
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,201
ignorant student of
the academy...

227
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:23,496
That tool was created
by the Grand Wizard Eibon...

228
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,166
It's a work of genius.

229
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:27,459
What? Eibon...?

230
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:30,295
If he made this,
he's an evil piece of trash.

231
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:34,674
[Fisher King] Would you say
that of Lord Death as well?

232
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,387
What does my father
have to do with this?!

233
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,889
[Fisher King]
Oh, how cute...

234
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:44,142
So you're the Grim
Reaper's son, are you?

235
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:45,977
Then let me show
you something.

236
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,145
Open the box that held

237
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:50,482
the Eternal Spring
and look inside.

238
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,859
That box there...?

239
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,779
What's in it that I need to see?

240
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:58,990
[Fisher King] Eibon's tool
isn't just the spring alone...

241
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:00,533
It also includes the box

242
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,952
you see there with
the keyhole in it...

243
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:05,413
That's where you need to look.

244
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,248
Go on...! Open it...!

245
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,876
Open it...!
You know you want to...

246
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,962
Read what's written on
the plate inside the box!

247
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:28,311
It says... Eibon... and then...

248
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:31,856
Below that it says... it says...

249
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,149
"Death"...

250
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,567
There's no mistaking it...

251
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,945
That's Dad's handwriting.

252
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:41,116
Why would Dad's signature
be on something evil like this?

253
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,867
[Liz]
What's wrong Kid?

254
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,745
[Fisher King]
Yes... What's wrong?

255
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:46,913
Could it be you find

256
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,666
what's written there
a tad disturbing...?

257
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:54,045
Whose signature is it you
see there on that evil tool?

258
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,588
What's the meaning of this...?

259
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:57,924
Tell me what's going on here!

260
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:01,219
[Fisher King]
Eibon is...

261
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:05,056
What was that?

262
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,558
[Mizune]
Chi.

263
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,352
What's he doing here?

264
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:11,271
It's Sid.

265
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:18,528
[Sid] I'll take care
of the others

266
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:21,698
with a collection squad
from the African branch.

267
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:24,200
You guys go get some rest.

268
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:30,623
This soul belongs to you, Kid...

269
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,792
Go ahead and take it.

270
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,589
[Desert soldier 1]
Get it! Shoot it down!

271
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,508
[Mizune]
Chi chi chi.

272
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,885
[Desert soldier 2] Sid, there
was a witch here, too...

273
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,219
She escaped.

274
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,555
Our objective was
the Eternal Spring...

275
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:47,807
Let the witch go.

276
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:48,975
[Desert soldier 2]
Okay, kids...

277
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,102
You head on to the
camp for some rest...

278
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:53,271
There'll be cold drinks
waiting for you.

279
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,231
Yea...! Thank you, mister!

280
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,900
Awesome... Thanks.

281
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,568
Yeah... thanks.

282
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,655
[Liz]
Finally! Outta this heat!

283
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,635
Objective has been completed...

284
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:27,055
The DWMA has
another Magic Tool.

285
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:53,832
[Kid]
Nothing there.

286
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,877
I'm not finding anything
even remotely useful in the

287
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,755
level one reference books.

288
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,175
Would you say that
of Lord Death as well?

289
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:08,722
[Kid thinks]
Who exactly is Eibon?

290
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,771
Yes, may I help you...?

291
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,065
Is there a specific
book you need?

292
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,526
Actually, I'd like to see any
materials that you have

293
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,236
in the Level Four
Block regarding

294
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,698
the person known as Eibon.

295
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,117
Let me see your student ID.

296
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,287
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

297
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,372
Students with up to
two stars can check out

298
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:35,915
books from the second level...

299
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,043
Faculty can view all
Level Three materials.

300
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,502
Only Death Scythes and

301
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:43,298
select high-ranking meisters
may access Level Four.

302
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,258
You are only a
one-star meister...

303
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:48,470
As such, you may only check
out books from the first level.

304
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,555
Take a look at
the back of my card.

305
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,057
Okay.

306
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,060
Please excuse me.

307
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,102
I didn't realize you

308
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,313
were a member of
Lord Death's family.

309
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,483
I'll find the books you
asked for immediately, sir.

310
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,942
Please wait here a moment.

311
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,444
[Kid]
Thank you.

312
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:12,494
[Kid thinks] I'm still only
a one-star meister...

313
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:16,581
I'd hoped to have been much
further along than that by now.

314
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,917
If I ask Dad straight out,
he'll brush me off like

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,587
he did when I asked
about the Kishin.

316
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,256
I have to find out myself.

317
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:28,385
[Kid]
Have you found it?

318
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:31,763
Yes... One book does
match your request...

319
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:34,182
It contains information
about Eibon.

320
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,642
Great. Can you please direct me

321
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:38,019
to the shelf that
it's on...It's urgent.

322
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:42,273
Unfortunately, it seems that the
book was lent out two months ago

323
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:44,484
and has not yet been returned.

324
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,152
[Kid] Do you know
who borrowed it...?

325
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,696
If necessary, I'll track down

326
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,074
whoever it is myself
and ask that they return it.

327
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,915
Again, I'm deeply sorry, sir...

328
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,750
Due to insufficient records...

329
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:04,963
I do not know who was the
last person to check it out.

330
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,298
The signature line
has no name on it...

331
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,092
There's only the letter M...

332
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:12,053
Nothing more, I'm afraid.

333
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,805
I'm very sorry.

334
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:17,225
Please forgive my
negligence in this.

335
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,151
[Kid thinks]
Who besides me would

336
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:28,653
have an interest in
a book like that?

337
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,656
It was taken out of the
library two months ago.

338
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:35,869
On the first of April.

339
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:38,413
The day the Kishin revived?

340
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,499
M...

341
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,003
M?!

342
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,213
Was it Medusa?

343
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:06,566
[closing song]

344
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:32,694
[Patty]
Choo choo!

345
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,487
[Liz]
Aww, I'm sunburned!

346
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:36,990
Do you know what that
does to my beautiful skin?!

347
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:38,283
Choo choo!

348
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,452
[Patty] Excalibur's back in
the next episode!

349
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:41,786
Choo choo!

350
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,955
[Liz] No, Patty, next time
it's about the party.

351
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:44,831
Choo choo!

352
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,207
[Patty]
Parties are fun!

353
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,751
Honk honk meow!

354
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,919
[Liz] That's not what
a train sounds like.

355
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:51,129
Choo choo!

356
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,214
[Patty] On the next
episode of Soul Eater...

357
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,424
Drying Happiness...

358
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:56,509
Whose Tears Sparkle
in the Moonlight?

359
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:57,552
Choo choo!

360
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,679
[Liz] What kind
of preview is this?

361
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:00,930
Choo choo!
