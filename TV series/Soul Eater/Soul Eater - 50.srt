1
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,868
A sound soul...

2
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,078
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,873
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:00,842
What's going to happen next?

5
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,219
At this point, who knows?

6
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:04,471
But...

7
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:06,514
...we can be sure about
one thing at least...

8
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:07,849
With the Kishin around...

9
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:11,019
...the whole world'll
be buried in madness.

10
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,937
Did Medusa really
believe she'd be

11
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,565
able to beat such an opponent?

12
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:20,779
Which do you mean?
The Kishin or the Grim Reaper?

13
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:24,532
Whichever...
It seems impossible either way.

14
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:29,788
I wish I knew what
was going on in there.

15
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:38,880
Black Star,
are you ready for this?

16
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,048
Huh?

17
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,633
We've gotta find a
way to hold him back.

18
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:44,427
Hah...! Hold him back?
Gimme a break...

19
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:47,472
I don't know about you but
I got bigger plans than that.

20
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,016
I'm gonna kill this guy!

21
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,326
Maka.

22
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,454
Is it you?

23
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:16,418
Yeah...
Who were you expecting?

24
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,211
It's Soul.

25
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:26,886
♪ opening song ♪

26
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:59,062
It is you!
I'm so relieved!

27
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,064
This isn't over, though...

28
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,984
I'm locked in this room...

29
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,821
I relied too much
on the black blood...

30
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,489
...and because of that,
most of my soul

31
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:12,367
has been consumed
by its insanity.

32
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah... I know...

33
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:16,287
...that's why I'm
here to get you.

34
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,498
Hurry up... We need to
get out of this room!

35
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,000
We can't.

36
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,168
The door's gone.

37
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:25,046
It disappeared behind you
as soon as you walked in.

38
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,508
Is there another way?

39
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:30,927
If I knew that, do you think
I'd still be hanging around?

40
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:33,555
Yeah, okay, you've
got a good point.

41
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:35,598
Window?

42
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,474
None at all.

43
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:37,434
We could break through the wall.

44
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,560
Nope.

45
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:39,811
Or rip up the floor
and dig a tunnel?

46
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:40,687
No way.

47
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,522
Then we'll never get outta here.

48
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:43,940
Actually, there is a way...

49
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:45,233
Really?

50
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:48,069
The one and only
way out of here.

51
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:57,203
Sink or Swim...
The Men Who Transcend the Gods?

52
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,800
Death Cannon.

53
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,609
Thanks for the
excellent massage.

54
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,194
It was quite rejuvenating.

55
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:33,490
I thought I was never going to
get that crick out of my neck.

56
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,949
We need to do something...

57
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,951
We're losing ground quickly.

58
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,286
"Losing ground?"...

59
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,623
But that implies you'd
gained some to begin with.

60
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:49,255
When you're up against a power
as strong as mine is, it's not a

61
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,633
question of gaining ground
or making progress.

62
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:54,469
It's a question
of staying alive.

63
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,054
Unfortunately for you,

64
00:05:56,137 --> 00:06:00,934
that particular question isn't
going to have a pleasant answer.

65
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,644
You're right...

66
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:05,188
...with the level of
attack we're using now...

67
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,650
...we're hard pressed
to even put a dent in you.

68
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,901
In which case...

69
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,361
Huh?

70
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:12,696
We're just going to have

71
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,864
to attack you even
harder, aren't we?

72
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,952
Dad...

73
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,370
I'm sorry...

74
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:23,331
I didn't understand
what you were doing...

75
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:26,876
I doubted you and
every move you made...

76
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,964
Then the Kishin defeated you...

77
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,009
And it's all my fault.

78
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,593
Pathetic...

79
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,178
Useless...!

80
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,889
I don't deserve to be his son.

81
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:41,433
I wish...

82
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,727
I wish I'd trusted him...

83
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,770
Things would be different now...

84
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,814
I failed my father...

85
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:51,234
Maybe I don't have
what it takes to do this.

86
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,486
But...

87
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,905
I can try...

88
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,074
Hear me now, Asura!

89
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:01,286
Die, in the name
of the Grim Reaper!

90
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:04,998
Liz, Patty...
Ready?

91
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,082
--Yes!
--Yeah!

92
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,711
Let's go Soul Resonance!

93
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,134
His soul is so strong!

94
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:19,012
Black Star...
Follow my lead now...

95
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:20,305
I'll need some back up.

96
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,223
That's a low move, Kid.
No way!

97
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,476
Stealing my spotlight
at a time like this?!

98
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,520
We don't have
time to fool around.

99
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:28,730
Can't you see that right now,

100
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,399
all that matters is
destroying him?!

101
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:34,486
I need you to hold him
back until I'm ready.

102
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:36,654
What'll you do?

103
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:37,822
This next shot...

104
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,991
I'm giving it all I have...

105
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,869
There will be no second chances.

106
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:43,912
Back me up.

107
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:44,662
Hell no!

108
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,122
What?!

109
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:48,083
That plan doesn't work for me...

110
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,709
First, I'll charge
right at 'im...

111
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:53,672
Then you can join the fight and
back me up when you're ready.

112
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,215
Uh, Black Star...

113
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:58,468
I'm the star of this
show 'till it's over.

114
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,554
Have it your way.

115
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:28,581
K...

116
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,377
Kid!!!

117
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,386
A way out?
Great, so what should we do?

118
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,185
Is that it...?
A box?

119
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,481
Looks like it's locked.

120
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:03,158
What the--?

121
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,411
Careful...
Go easy on that, okay?

122
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,620
You gotta be gentle.

123
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,206
It's my courage that's
locked up in there.

124
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,167
Liar!

125
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,169
It isn't my
courage in here...!..

126
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,212
Do you hear me, Maka?

127
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,173
It's me locked inside...!

128
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,300
Don't you get it?

129
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,426
Maka...! Look...

130
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,096
I'm down here...!
I'm inside the box!

131
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,265
This is all because
of the black blood...

132
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,475
I used it too much,

133
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:31,144
and now my courage's
trapped inside that box.

134
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,021
That's why we need to open it...

135
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:35,523
So we can both
get out of this room.

136
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:38,318
He's lying, Maka...! It's me!

137
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,903
I sealed myself in here...

138
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:42,238
...before the black
blood could take over.

139
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,448
If you open the box,

140
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,618
my soul will be consumed
by the black blood!

141
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,621
I tried everything I
could possibly think of,

142
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:52,332
but nothing I did
would open it.

143
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,878
He only wants you to open
it for him so he can

144
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,963
get in here and devour
what's left of me.

145
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:00,256
Please see that...!

146
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,549
It isn't me out there...!

147
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,260
It's the demon...
Please, Maka!

148
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,679
Makaaaa!!

149
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,180
The thing is...

150
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:09,849
I'm pretty sure you're the
only one who can get it open.

151
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,184
Yeah...?

152
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,477
I open this...

153
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,354
...and then you'll be
able to get out?

154
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,605
Yeah, exactly...

155
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,358
Just look.
The key's in your hand.

156
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,532
You idiot...!
Don't listen to him...!

157
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:29,494
Do not open it!
You know that isn't me, Maka!

158
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,750
Kid...
Damn you!

159
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,168
Uh uh uh...

160
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:39,546
You blame me for this?
That's not fair.

161
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,007
I don't recall inviting you to
follow me in here.

162
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,592
That choice was yours.

163
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,488
Kid what the heck's
going on here...?

164
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,074
I've never seen your soul
do something like that before!

165
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,076
I have no idea what's happening,

166
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,912
but it sure is cool, huh, sis?

167
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,000
Whatever it is...

168
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,836
...we'd better think of
something to do now!

169
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,505
Yea!

170
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,598
Huh?
What's that?

171
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:35,935
The Lines of Sanzu.
I remember you now...

172
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,105
You're the Grim Reaper's little
son, aren't you...? Excellent.

173
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:43,151
I can deal with you the same
way I dealt with your father.

174
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,781
You've got the
wrong target, dude!

175
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,866
You shouldn't underestimate me.

176
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,660
I'm the one who's gonna
destroy you, not him...!

177
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,287
Take your eyes off
me for a second,

178
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,289
and it'll be the
last thing you do!

179
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,333
Shut up, insect!

180
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:04,631
Didn't I tell you?
Don't take your eyes off me!

181
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:08,426
Black Star Big Waaaave!

182
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,221
Damn!

183
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,142
Where're you lookin'...?
I'm here!

184
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:18,353
Nope...!
Over here! Here!

185
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,563
Right here, ya slowpoke!

186
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,869
Stop it right now!

187
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,627
The real one is...

188
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,879
Right here!

189
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,298
I got you that time!

190
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,384
Yahoo!

191
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:52,971
What?!

192
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,597
I warned you, didn't I?

193
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:57,642
I'm the one who's
gonna destroy you!

194
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,985
Now, Kid!
Fire away.

195
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,405
Hey look at the
stripes in his hair!

196
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,449
They're all connect-y!

197
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:21,374
Resonance rate is at
two thousand percent?!

198
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,459
Impossible!

199
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,670
And the noise level...!
It's at zero!

200
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,467
Feedback complete...
We're ready to fire!

201
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,968
Let's go!

202
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,197
Woo-hoo...!
Woo-hoo...!

203
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,408
We did it...!
We got the Kishin, Patty!

204
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,457
Kid!

205
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,958
What's wrong?!

206
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,714
That was one hell of a shot.

207
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:12,217
But what happened to Kid?

208
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,889
It's no big deal.
This is Kid we're talking about.

209
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:20,892
It'll take more
than that to kill him.

210
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:24,396
Black Star?

211
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,274
Oh no!

212
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,111
Come on...
Don't get so upset, Tsubaki...

213
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:34,197
If he's back, that can
only mean one thing.

214
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:35,990
I knew it...

215
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,492
Today's the day
I'm gonna fulfill

216
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:40,161
my destiny and surpass god!

217
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,167
Any movement down there?

218
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,794
Something must've happened...

219
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,796
There's a crack in the
Grim Reaper's mask

220
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,464
that wasn't there before.

221
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:53,425
Are you all right, Death Scythe?

222
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:56,052
Yeah...
could be a lot worse.

223
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,930
Can't you use your Clairvoyance
to see what's going on with the

224
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,182
students and the Kishin
inside the barrier?

225
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,767
I can't...

226
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:05,645
...not without a pre-established
link to at least one of them.

227
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,231
Then for all we know, the
battle could already be over.

228
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,232
Maybe they beat him.

229
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:10,775
Fool!

230
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:14,195
Nothing has been decided yet...
The battle's still going on.

231
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,989
What...?
Are you sure about that?

232
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:18,366
Fool...!
Of course I am!

233
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,410
Does that mean you can
see what's going on insi--

234
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,495
Fool...!
Silence.

235
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,624
I require a cup of tea
before I deign to answer that.

236
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,418
Um how about coffee instead?

237
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,754
Fool...! I said tea...

238
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,380
And I mean tea!

239
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,632
This guy...!

240
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,885
Hey everybody...
What's all the commotion?

241
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,803
Stein!
When did you get back here?!

242
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,472
Why did you miss me...?

243
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,266
I guess I should apologize
for causing so much trouble.

244
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,893
A little late for that.

245
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,353
This is serious...

246
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,356
Maka, Black Star, and Kid
are all inside that barrier,

247
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,775
fighting the Kishin
as we speak.

248
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,070
Maka...

249
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:58,031
Then it's up to her...
to Maka...

250
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:01,034
We were right about it coming
down to Genie Hunter.

251
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,620
Her mother's technique.

252
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:05,830
Maka's Genie Hunter.

253
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:09,334
Well...

254
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,086
...open it...

255
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,796
...go on...

256
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,297
...do it now...

257
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,634
Hurry up.

258
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:22,180
Don't do it...!
Don't open the box!

259
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:27,185
What are you doing?
Open it and we can go.

260
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:29,354
Sure... but first...

261
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:31,314
...tell me something...

262
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:32,482
Pathetic!

263
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:34,859
If you're not gonna
open it, I will.

264
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,611
I'm not giving you the key.

265
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,113
What?!

266
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:39,989
Now...

267
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:42,409
...tell me who you are.

268
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:43,868
Maka...

269
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,870
What're you talking about...?
You know me.

270
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,580
You're not Soul.

271
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:49,165
Shut up...!
Of course I am.

272
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:50,500
Just look at me!

273
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,751
Liar.

274
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:54,462
Soul would never ask me
for something like this.

275
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,673
I'm asking because
there's no other way!

276
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:57,674
Okay...

277
00:16:57,757 --> 00:16:59,801
...tell me why you
closed the door!

278
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,178
The real Soul never
would have closed it...

279
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,055
Not if it would trap me too...

280
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:06,641
He would have told
me to turn back.

281
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:13,898
I know my partner.
And you're not him.

282
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:15,650
Yes...!
Nice once, Maka.

283
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,736
You're not an idiot.

284
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:25,035
Yeah, you're right.
Well, half right at least.

285
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,328
I'm not the Soul you knew.

286
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,749
It's you.

287
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,334
Yes...

288
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,794
I may not look like your good
friend Soul, but I assure you,

289
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,546
I'm a genuine soul eater.

290
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:38,715
And I am a part
of Soul as well...

291
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:40,800
...just as he, too,
is a part of me...

292
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:44,304
Soul and I work together
combined in a single body.

293
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:45,638
We're partners, he and I,

294
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:48,767
the kind that can't be
separated, no matter what.

295
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,643
That's why I say
you're only half right.

296
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,146
I am Soul, but at
the same time, I'm not.

297
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:56,858
It's complicated, I know.
I hope I'm not confusing you.

298
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,361
So the real Soul
is inside this box.

299
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,446
Yes...
That's correct...

300
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:03,281
Funny, isn't it?

301
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:06,659
Who would think such a small box
could hold all his arrogance...?

302
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,078
But, no matter...

303
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,996
I don't need him anymore...

304
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,457
My plan is very nearly complete.

305
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,336
The world is nearly mine now.
I can almost taste my success.

306
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,880
You're the only thing
standing in my way...

307
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:22,926
But not for too much longer.
You are going to do what I say.

308
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,260
Do it...

309
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,846
...refusing to open the
box won't help anything...

310
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,390
If you don't unlock
it, you'll have the

311
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,975
pleasure of watching
while Soul and I die.

312
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,727
So, you have two choices...

313
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,272
Keep the box closed and kill me,
along with your dear friend...

314
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,733
...or open it and
meet a new Soul...

315
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,527
...one who's been
consumed by the

316
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,070
madness of the black blood...

317
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,614
Which will it be?

318
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,908
Soul is actually in here,
though, right?

319
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,785
He absolutely is.

320
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,370
Right.

321
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,997
Then I'll open it...
I have to.

322
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:55,250
You what?!
Are you the crazy one?!

323
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,169
Haven't you heard
a thing he's said?!

324
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,422
That's the right decision.

325
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:02,841
I knew you weren't
the type of girl

326
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,759
who would abandon her partner.

327
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,760
Now...

328
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:06,469
...go ahead...

329
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,221
...go on and open it.

330
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:10,015
Yes... I will...

331
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:13,226
...but I won't let the
insanity take Soul.

332
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,562
I'll save him.

333
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:17,272
I swear it!

334
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,191
I'm coming, Soul!

335
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,320
I'm here!

336
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,821
Maka!

337
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,603
What...
what happened?

338
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,105
Impossible!

339
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:49,572
You are the biggest
moron, Maka...

340
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:50,865
Such an idiot...

341
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,742
But then of course that's
what makes you the

342
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,328
coolest partner a
weapon could have.

343
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,455
Damn...

344
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,709
...after everything I've done,
I'm stuck back here again?

345
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,919
What are you getting so
worked up about, little guy?

346
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:04,462
Little guy?

347
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:05,672
Pathetic.

348
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,590
You're getting rid
of me, aren't you?

349
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,676
How could I do
something like that?

350
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,678
You're still a part
of me, after all...

351
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,179
...and so...

352
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,601
I'll have to accept you.

353
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,409
We made it back.

354
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:37,245
Yeah...
thanks to you, we did.

355
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,622
Where did Kid and
Black Star go?

356
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,584
Kid!

357
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,462
Black Star!

358
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:49,883
There's no reason
to be surprised.

359
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:54,220
As expected...
I am the one still standing.

360
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,681
And they are the ones
who fell before me...

361
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,683
...like insects.

362
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:02,520
You're fools if you expected
some other outcome than this.

363
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,982
Welcome to
harsh reality, children.

364
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,109
There are no surprises here...

365
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,820
...and no uncertainty.

366
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:12,989
Also...

367
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,242
There is no fear.

368
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:21,331
♪ closing song ♪

369
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:08,980
On the final episode
of Soul Eater...

370
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:11,024
The Word is Bravery!

371
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:16,112
Watch it...
Or I'll take your soul!
