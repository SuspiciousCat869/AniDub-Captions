1
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,520
A sound soul...

2
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,731
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,525
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:45,035
It's all right, Ashura.

5
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:48,955
I'll be by your side, watching
over you and protecting you.

6
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,209
Like this...
Always and forever.

7
00:00:56,254 --> 00:01:01,259
♪ opening song  ♪

8
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,899
What's happening?

9
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,485
Everything is so confusing.

10
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,821
Guilty!
You betrayed us!

11
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,198
There's too much going
on at one time...

12
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:49,492
I can't make sense of it all.

13
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,300
And right now...

14
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,135
...it's difficult to tell
what the academy's

15
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,679
real objective is in all this.

16
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,477
The Kishin's free...

17
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,481
...and the world is about to
be consumed by madness.

18
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,863
That's where our
focus should be.

19
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:30,241
After all, the academy
was founded

20
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,370
in the first place to
fight the Kishin.

21
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,750
That I understand...

22
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,628
...but what about everything
else they've done...?

23
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,089
What happens now?

24
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,266
Trouble sleeping?

25
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:57,977
Leave me alone.

26
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,902
Acting like this isn't gonna
help you out any tomorrow...

27
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:09,698
The mission's gonna
be difficult enough as it is.

28
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:14,703
Hey, Soul.

29
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,580
Are they doing the right thing?

30
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,958
Who?
What're you talking about?

31
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,877
The academy...

32
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,505
I don't understand what
they're doing anymore...

33
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:29,300
They've completely stopped
looking for Professor Stein.

34
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,638
Then there's all that
other stuff Kid told us about...

35
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,557
And also...

36
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,601
What about poor Crona...?

37
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,604
He's still locked
up in that cell.

38
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,733
No idea...
You know as much as I do.

39
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:50,697
Sitting in the dark and
pouting isn't gonna help...

40
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,657
Just get some sleep.

41
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,377
Be careful out
there today, you two.

42
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,005
Hah...! We can handle
this, no problem...

43
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:10,717
We'll destroy the Kishin and
be back before you even know it.

44
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,472
Something wrong?

45
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,349
Don't worry about her.

46
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:20,727
She'll snap out of it soon.

47
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,688
Let's do this.

48
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:28,485
Everyone's working so hard
to stop this Kishin guy...

49
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:31,112
I want to help defeat him too!

50
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,198
Meow!

51
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:41,164
Charge Baba Yaga's Castle!
o~ Things are Kind of Gloomy?

52
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,794
The objective
of today's mission...

53
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,921
Destroy the Kishin Ashura.

54
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,465
In addition, we will target
those who have sided with

55
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:52,467
the Kishin including
the witch Arachnay,

56
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,470
and the members of her
organization Arachnophobia.

57
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:56,388
We will be launching an
attack on their base...

58
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,889
Lies.

59
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:02,394
Cover-ups...
Repeated without hesitation.

60
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,812
While they turn a blind eye

61
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,815
to everything else
but their mission.

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,235
The madness is spreading.

63
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:14,739
It must be stopped...
before it's too late.

64
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:18,034
Which means we will also
be battling against time.

65
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:19,411
Our first objective...

66
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,329
Destroy the Kishin.

67
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,330
Second...

68
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,249
We obliterate the
madness machine.

69
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:27,544
And then...
the madness relay stations.

70
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:28,795
And finally...

71
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:29,629
Arachnay...

72
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:30,755
Kill her...

73
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,591
...and destroy her organization.

74
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,136
Fine then...

75
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,513
They can ignore
it all if they want...

76
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:41,099
But they can't make me forget.

77
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,601
We have every
confidence in your skills.

78
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,520
But we realize the
risk of coming

79
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:47,439
into contact with the Kishin...

80
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,399
So do not forget to
take your doses of

81
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:52,110
madness suppressant
before you leave.

82
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:57,073
And now...

83
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,784
...a word from Lord Death.

84
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,747
Students!

85
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:11,212
Do your best, okay...?

86
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:12,964
Victory!
Victory!

87
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:13,923
That's it?

88
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,759
Victory!
Victory!

89
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:16,634
All right...

90
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:18,470
The operation will now commence.

91
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,138
First destination...

92
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,973
Baba Yaga Castle.

93
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:31,066
Excuse me, Mr. Sid.

94
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,568
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

95
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,445
Go ahead.

96
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,364
It's about Crona.

97
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,533
What're they going
to do with him...?

98
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:41,743
Please tell me...

99
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,870
I know you know.

100
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:49,876
Crona's been exiled, Maka.

101
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,252
He was a spy...

102
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,587
...and a traitor...

103
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,923
He's done a lot of
damage to the academy...

104
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:56,132
Given that...

105
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,926
...exile is lenient.

106
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,972
Exile...?
But where can he go?

107
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,266
When I was alive,
I had tight lips...

108
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,519
I knew how to keep a secret...

109
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:10,105
That's the kind of man I was...

110
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:13,775
But I did talk out
loud to myself at times.

111
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:16,319
Maybe Crona's exile
is just a cover...

112
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:18,446
Maybe he left with Miss Marie...

113
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,532
...to go after Medusa.

114
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:21,783
With Miss Marie...

115
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,368
...but why?

116
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:25,412
Yesterday...

117
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:26,663
Marie resigned...

118
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,249
She's no longer
with the academy.

119
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:36,047
Crona is going to settle things
with Medusa once and for all.

120
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:38,008
Medusa.

121
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,300
It's all right...

122
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,469
Miss Marie will be
there to back him up...

123
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,305
You should focus
on today's operation.

124
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,812
We're counting on you and
your Anti-Magic Wavelength...

125
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,064
Don't let us down.

126
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,443
So that's it.

127
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,695
That's how they're
gonna handle it...?

128
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:02,323
This is the adults'
great solution?

129
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,379
Maka...
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:18,631
What is it, Crona...?
What's wrong?

131
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,134
Oh, uh...
it's nothing.

132
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:21,968
Fine...

133
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:23,970
...then let's keep moving.

134
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:30,185
I was in this same
desert not long ago.

135
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,939
I thought I was escaping.

136
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,485
This time...

137
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:41,446
...this time it's different.

138
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:48,036
Maka...
I'm sorry I had to lie.

139
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,621
But...

140
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:52,165
I'm not running anymore.

141
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,172
We should split our
forces into thirds

142
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,299
and make our attack
on three fronts.

143
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,052
And the soldiers in charge of
demolishing the relay stations

144
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,512
need to synchronize
their attacks

145
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,806
so they all happen at one time.

146
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,601
This is the first attack
on so grand a scale

147
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,353
since the academy was founded.

148
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:14,938
That suppressant...

149
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,774
...do you really think it'll be
effective against the madness?

150
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:20,235
If such a medicine
actually existed,

151
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,904
I would have delivered it
throughout the world already.

152
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,531
I thought so.

153
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:25,699
Suppressing panic...

154
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,659
...an obvious tactic.

155
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:30,870
Lord Death...

156
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,415
What I'd like to know is
why I'm stationed here.

157
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:36,292
Yeah, that is a good question.

158
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,169
You were the one
who made that call!

159
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,921
Given what we're up against,

160
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,799
I don't think we can have too
many forces in the field...

161
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,468
Based on my analysis, it
wouldn't hurt to have

162
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:48,138
all the Death Scythes
fighting out there.

163
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:51,057
Easier said than done, Azusa.

164
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,434
Yikes!

165
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,060
We're battling a Kishin today...

166
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:56,187
...yet for some reason
you're keeping me here,

167
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,064
and you sent Marie and
Kid off on assignments

168
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:00,483
that have nothing to do
with the fighting...

169
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,236
If you ask me,
it defies common sense.

170
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:04,988
We can't know for
sure what's going

171
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:07,157
to happen on the
battlefield today...

172
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,325
Surely you'll agree the
best plan of action

173
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,037
is to prepare for
all possibilities.

174
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,831
There you see now...!
Not so simple!

175
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,751
Oh dear!

176
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:20,086
Whatever they say...

177
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,006
I still think our forces
are too spread out.

178
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,717
Why don't you put
that scary face away

179
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,052
and come have a cup of tea?

180
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:28,053
Pull up a seat!

181
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,721
There's some yummy
cake over here!

182
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:32,140
All right, you two!.
Shape up!

183
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:37,479
I don't know how
to handle this woman.

184
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:38,271
What was that?

185
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:39,898
Nothing!

186
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,107
Well...

187
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,650
I'm sure things will
sort themselves out...

188
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,611
in the meantime,
we'll focus on dealing

189
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:47,489
with each new
problem as it arises.

190
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,493
Wonderful.

191
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,498
I told Lord Death I wouldn't
pause to accept some help.

192
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,792
Hi, Mister Joe.
I'm Blair the cat...!

193
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,960
Starting today,
I'm your new assistant.

194
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,253
Exciting, huh?

195
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:03,880
I'm Lisa from Chupacabra!

196
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,423
And my name's Arisa.

197
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,468
But I don't think he
understood my request!

198
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,512
Ha.
Meow, meow!

199
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:17,560
We are now entering
Arachnophobia's territory.

200
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:18,561
All forces...

201
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,271
Make sure you're in place.

202
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:22,607
Ready yourselves for the attack.

203
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:40,750
Is there something
bothering you, Maka?

204
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,253
No.
It's nothing.

205
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:44,421
Uh-oh.

206
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:45,672
You're not getting
cold feet, are you...?

207
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:47,507
Because there's nothing
to be afraid of...!..

208
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,426
Not as long
as I'm here, anyway...!

209
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,052
With a big star like me around,

210
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:55,056
this is the safest place
in the entire world!

211
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,143
If you don't quiet down,
they'll know we're here.

212
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:02,439
Are you still thinking about
that crap from last night?

213
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,773
Maybe.

214
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:05,900
You have to keep your
head in the game today...

215
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,819
...otherwise, the whole
thing will fall apart.

216
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,530
You of all people
should know that!

217
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:13,992
Don't worry, Soul.

218
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,452
I'm sure Maka's going
to do really well today...

219
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:18,121
Sid and Lord Death both said
her Anti-Magic Wavelength

220
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:19,748
might be all we need.

221
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:22,584
They're counting on
a technique I can't master...

222
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,419
It's ridiculous.

223
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,129
But there's more
to it than that.

224
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:27,630
The Genie Hunter's
not the only thing

225
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:29,341
that makes you a great fighter.

226
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:32,344
There's nothing
that's great about me.

227
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,596
Damn...! Quit being
such a perfectionist!

228
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,598
Yeah, like that'll happen!

229
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,975
Black Star, will you
please be quiet?!

230
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,061
Just leave me alone, guys.

231
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,440
You had a conversation with
Sid before we left, didn't you?

232
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,776
What, you mean about
the Genie Hunter move...?

233
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,152
I told you, it's ridiculous.

234
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:50,403
No, not that...

235
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,698
About Miss Marie and Crona.

236
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:57,369
Do you understand
what's really going on...?

237
00:13:57,452 --> 00:14:00,246
Why it had to
be the two of them?

238
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,668
The DWMA made
a deal with Medusa...

239
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,711
...because of that,
we can't harm her.

240
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:09,130
Lord Death gave his word not to.

241
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,508
But Crona's
an exile, isn't he...?

242
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,302
And Miss Marie
quit her teaching job.

243
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,473
Lord Death's making some
pretty low moves these days...

244
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,642
There might be something
in what Kid told us...

245
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:24,604
So maybe we really can't
trust the academy anymore.

246
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,650
Soul's right...
That's a sneaky plan.

247
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,945
I was wondering why
Kid's not here with us...

248
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,864
Maybe this has
something to do with it.

249
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,039
We can't afford to
freak out about

250
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,291
every little thing that
comes our way right now.

251
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,043
If you ask me,
it's the other way around.

252
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,004
We can't afford not to.

253
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,215
Don't know about you,
but I'm here to win...

254
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:54,926
I'm gonna take down
every last one of 'em.

255
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,761
And when that's over...

256
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,888
I'll surpass God.

257
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:04,811
Great.
Here he goes again.

258
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,855
What should I do?

259
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,994
You can sleep soundly, Asura.

260
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,079
It's okay...

261
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,915
As long as I'm
here by your side.

262
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:37,969
You'll see my dear one...

263
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,679
Before much longer, the world

264
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:43,683
will be utterly consumed
by delicious madness.

265
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:48,104
Until then, you'll stay here
with me where you'll be safe.

266
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,940
Lady Arachne...

267
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,108
...we have an issue.

268
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,277
Let's hear it.

269
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:57,989
We have detected DWMA forces.

270
00:15:58,073 --> 00:15:59,574
Oh really?

271
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,159
Yes, my lady.

272
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:04,245
And it appears they're searching
for a way into Baba Yaga Castle.

273
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:12,921
So it would seem...

274
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:14,047
They shouldn't have been able

275
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,007
to find the castle's
location, though.

276
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,634
I don't think
storming the castle

277
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,844
is their only
objective, either.

278
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:21,805
They seem to have
deployed six additional

279
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:24,224
squads to other areas.

280
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,101
Six forces?

281
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:29,020
They're targeting
the relay stations.

282
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:32,649
The bulk of their forces will
be arriving at our gates soon.

283
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,568
How do they know?

284
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:42,242
Medusa...!
It must have been.

285
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,202
Prepare for a counterattack...

286
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,162
I want all of the
troops out there...

287
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:49,124
The DWMA must be stopped,
no matter what.

288
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,625
Right.

289
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,546
Hurry...!
Move, you maggots!

290
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:55,964
We've got a
battle to fight here!

291
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,465
I want everyone prepared.

292
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,258
Understood?

293
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,759
Yes!

294
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,600
It's finally time.

295
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:10,729
I'm gonna grind
these fools into dust!

296
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:16,568
Look at this, Stein...
It's beginning.

297
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:28,955
We don't want to
miss one minute of this.

298
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,000
A new world order
is going to be born today.

299
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:36,421
Everything is about to change.

300
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,927
This is the Fifth...
We're in place.

301
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,680
Third Squadron here...
We are in position.

302
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,016
The Seventh is ready to go.

303
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,017
Captain...
We're ready...

304
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,353
All squads in place.

305
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:54,147
All right...
Listen up, everyon--

306
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:03,740
Let's go!

307
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,950
Rip 'em apart!

308
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,746
Triple Speed Saw Leg!

309
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,752
All clear...!
Now move it!

310
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,260
That was a familiar attack...

311
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,971
Looks like an
old friend of mine.

312
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,191
Saw man...

313
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,151
...we meet again, do we?

314
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,614
This is gonna be the
last time for you, punk!

315
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,963
The enemy...!
Commence battle at once men!

316
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,591
Yeah...! I hope these
guys are ready

317
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,760
to see one hell of
a performance.

318
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,095
Not yet, Black Star.

319
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,680
Hold on.

320
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:13,643
What do you think Maka?

321
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:17,480
The Kishin has to be defeated...

322
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,316
The academy is
doing the right thing.

323
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,194
But still...

324
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,321
Even knowing that...

325
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,617
There's no way I can abandon
Professor Stein and Crona...

326
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,911
That's not who I am.

327
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:35,415
We have to be careful about
who at the academy we trust.

328
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,627
I can't just
forget about them...

329
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,672
...but I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

330
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,799
What do I do?!

331
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,967
Ugh!

332
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,260
Would you stop
being such a crybaby...?!

333
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:48,428
Wah, wah, wah!

334
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,304
Whine, whine, whine!

335
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,097
What the hell's wrong with you?

336
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:52,432
What is your problem...?

337
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:55,310
Why are you talking
to me like that?

338
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:58,104
Because you have
to make a decision.

339
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,523
Get a grip, Maka...!

340
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,817
Decide what you're going to do!

341
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:29,844
Yes...

342
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:32,555
I see now.

343
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:38,853
You know, it's funny...

344
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,649
My dad always used to warn me
to choose my friends wisely...

345
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,776
...and he was right.

346
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:45,694
Look at me...

347
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,570
...a perfect student...

348
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:48,780
Thanks to you...

349
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,907
I'm a rule breaker.

350
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:58,832
Right!

351
00:20:58,915 --> 00:20:59,916
That's it...

352
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,084
Sorry, Black Star...

353
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,169
...the rest is up to you!

354
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:06,047
What's with her?

355
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,384
From now on, I'm gonna
be doing things my way!

356
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:15,181
It's all you, man.

357
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:16,683
Hey!

358
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:20,979
Who's she kidding...?
Maka couldn't be more wrong.

359
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:26,067
I don't care what she says,
she's still a perfect student.

360
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:37,037
Hang on, Crona!
I'm coming!

361
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:06,191
♪ closing song ♪

362
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,111
I've made up my mind.

363
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,071
Now I just have to
run toward my goal!

364
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:36,239
Exactly...!

365
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:38,158
Sometimes in life
you need to run ahead...

366
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:40,452
But then again, sometimes
you need to stand still.

367
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:41,745
Uh, Miss Marie...?

368
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:44,581
To run or to stand
still--that is the question.

369
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,665
Huh?

370
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:48,209
Hmm, let's see here...

371
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,211
Maybe I could try
both at the same time!

372
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,047
That won't work!

373
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,840
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

374
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:55,342
The Last Magic Tool...

375
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:58,345
Mission Impossible
for Unarmed Kid?

376
00:23:58,428 --> 00:23:59,137
Watch it...

377
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,097
...or I'll take your soul!
