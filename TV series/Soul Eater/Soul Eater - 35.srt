Lost Island...

Long ago an explosion
occurred here,

creating a dangerously
strong magnetic field.

00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,049
[Maka]
Do you recognize him Kid?

169
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,884
[Kid]
Uh... no...

170
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,135
Time's running out, guys.

171
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,721
We're down to less
than ten minutes here...

172
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,599
We can't afford to
mess around anymore.

173
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,518
Let's get 'im!

174
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,353
Hand it over, gramps.

175
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,355
I may not know exactly
what's going on here,

176
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,232
but I know that tool is ours!

177
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:23,608
Eibon's getting away...!

178
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:24,651
C'mon Black Star!

179
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:25,777
[Black Star]
No time for that, Kid...

180
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,320
This show's ending
in ten minutes...

181
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,489
We've gotta prioritize.

182
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,866
Ten minutes is barely enough
time for a star like me

183
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,910
to put in a decent appearance.

184
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,162
You're pathetic!

185
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:38,164
You think making yourself
a few years younger and

186
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:41,042
a few pounds heavier
is gonna help against me?!

187
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,712
Don't make me laugh!

188
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,213
Hey!

189
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,550
Black Star's actually
right this time.

190
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,970
Our first priority is
getting Brew... Let's go.

191
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:53,471
[Maka]
Right!

192
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,768
Careful...! Are you guys okay?

193
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,772
Wake up, Kid!

194
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:03,898
Right, I know...

195
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:06,693
We've gotta take
care of this guy first.

196
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,990
Clearly, this man lacks
any sense of symmetry...

197
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,075
Let's remedy that.

198
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:17,996
Right...!

199
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,497
That's the spirit, Kid!

200
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,216
Three little babies...

201
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,635
This is all you're capable of?

202
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,475
[Mosquito] They don't make
'em like they used to.

203
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,727
This was me a hundred years ago.

204
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,356
Tougher and stronger than
all three of you put together.

205
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,234
[Maka]
No way...

206
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:51,029
There isn't a
single scratch on him.

207
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,614
This is bad...

208
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:55,950
We can't resonate souls
as a team, not in this place.

209
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,535
The static's too loud...

210
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,579
Maka's the only one
who could do it...

211
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:02,999
Her ability to perceive souls
is strong enough for this.

212
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,834
What are we gonna do, Soul...?

213
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:07,962
We'll never beat him if
we can't use resonance link.

214
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:10,674
[Soul]
Maybe I could direct her

215
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:13,885
ability and channel
everyone's souls.

216
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,303
What do you mean 'maybe'?

217
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,015
You know you
can do it.... Don't you...

218
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:20,517
Evans?

219
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,938
Don't call me
by that name, dammit.

220
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:27,649
Come on... right this way.

221
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:31,778
We're set up and ready to
go for the big concert.

222
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:34,489
[Sid]
Look after the injured.

223
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,033
[Naigus] The battle
didn't go our way.

224
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,745
You should look
after your injury, too.

225
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,081
I will... Soon enough.

226
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:43,915
Sid! Naigus!

227
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,125
We're here!

228
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,961
Kim, Jacqueline...
Glad you made it...

229
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,921
What about the others?

230
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:51,923
Well, sir...

231
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,800
The teachers
never came back out...

232
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,885
So Maka's team
went in to find them...

233
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:58,388
Ox and Kilik are
holding back the enemy.

234
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:00,849
They did what...?! Azusa...

235
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,726
Can you find the students?

236
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,769
No, I'm afraid not...

237
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,938
The field is too strong.

238
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,481
I can't see them.

239
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:11,401
[Sid] It'll take fifteen minutes
to get there in this snow...

240
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:14,446
Azusa, gather ten people who
can make the trek with me.

241
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,613
[Naigus]
Sid...

242
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,574
[Azusa] With those
injuries, you shouldn't!

243
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:21,077
Naigus... Quickly
see to my injuries.

244
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,413
[Naigus]
All right.

245
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:25,623
[Ox]
After the first wave,

246
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,625
our technique
suffered a little bit.

247
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:28,835
The enemy was rather strong,

248
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:31,212
but still, we could've
done much better.

249
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,548
Who cares if we
were a little sloppy...?

250
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,593
We won the fight, didn't we?

251
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,685
[Kilik]
Professor! Miss Marie!

252
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,771
What happened in there?!

253
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:54,778
I need you to watch
over the Professor.

254
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,238
[Stein] What are
you planning, Marie...?

255
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,408
The effects of the field won't
disappear just because you

256
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,328
stepped out of it for a moment.

257
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:07,207
Go back in and you're
throwing your life away.

258
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,291
I know that!

259
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,085
But if I don't,
what will happen?

260
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,128
You mean the rest
of them are still inside?

261
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,880
Then let us go in after them.

262
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,299
No...! You're not
going anywhere...!

263
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,509
I'm not letting any more of

264
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:19,719
my students go inside
that death trap!

265
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,681
If you disobey orders,
you will be punished...

266
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,391
I'll expel you!

267
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:28,144
What are we gonna do now Ox...?

268
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:31,064
You can't get expelled
from the academy.

269
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:34,234
[Ox] I don't think we have much
choice in the matter, Harvar.

270
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,821
None at all.

271
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:41,616
Academy students protect
their own. Simple as that.

272
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,001
[Marie]
No... Wait!

273
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,887
[Marie] Expulsion...
I can't even do that.

274
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:04,055
They don't let brand new

275
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:07,058
teachers go around
expelling students...

276
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:10,603
Not that threatening to stopped
them from going, anyway.

277
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,608
I'm an adult...
I'm their teacher...

278
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,111
I can't do anything!

279
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,614
What do I do...? I let them go!

280
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,117
What if they never come back?

281
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,037
[Marie sobs]

282
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,872
[Stein]
Don't cry, Marie.

283
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,374
The failure of the mission...

284
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,209
...any harm that comes
to the students...

285
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,713
Everything... it's all my fault.

286
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:38,214
All of it!

287
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:44,637
[Stein laughs like a mad man]

288
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,098
All!

289
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:54,898
[Mosquito] Surely
you've realized by now

290
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:56,316
that you can't beat me.

291
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,486
Shut up...! Give us
Brew immediately!

292
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,446
You think you're such
smart little children.

293
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:02,614
Can you even tell me what

294
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:05,450
this Magic Tool
inside my hat does?

295
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,119
Of course you can't...

296
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,205
And yet you've come all
this way and fought so

297
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,290
hard to get your hands on it...

298
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:15,001
The folly of youth has no end.

299
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:19,047
You brats don't even know
what you're fighting for.

300
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,674
We have Brew now...

301
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:24,177
Arachnophobia will soon
control the entire world.

302
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,096
You should run while you can.

303
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:27,597
[Black Star]
Shut up, grandpa...

304
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,683
I'm tired of hearing you yammer.

305
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,893
Tsubaki...! Enchanted Sword!

306
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:34,270
[Tsubaki]
Right!

307
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,313
Magic Tool...?

308
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,523
Who cares about that...?

309
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:38,108
Not me, baldy.

310
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:41,277
This isn't a fight between
Arachnophobia and the academy.

311
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:43,321
Not anymore...

312
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,657
It's between me and you!

313
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,783
Maka, Kid...!

314
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,660
Follow my lead on this!

315
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,787
Shadow Star!

316
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,665
A puny attack like that's not

317
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:57,377
going to do any damage
to me, you foolish boy!

318
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,053
Maka!

319
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:08,763
You bastard!

320
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:12,892
That was only round one.

321
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,811
I'll still take you down!

322
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,771
At this rate,
we've got no chance!

323
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,481
I'm growing bored.

324
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,735
Time to get rid of you.

325
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,529
Had enough yet?

326
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,574
A little more?

327
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:31,995
Tiny bugs like you
are easy to crush.

328
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,081
Come on guys!

329
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:36,791
It's time to get up now!

330
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,669
Shall we pull the curtain
down on this sad play?

331
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,671
No, the show's just beginning...

332
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:44,674
Right, Soul...?
Let's get started.

333
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:47,802
Police Stinger!

334
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,055
There's no more
time to think about it...

335
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,600
The stage is all set for the
big concert. It's time to play.

336
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:56,061
[Soul] The black blood
already spread to Maka...

337
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:59,731
This'll spread it to everyone
else on the team, won't it?

338
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,149
[Li'l Demon] Your
resonance with them

339
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,984
will be an indirect
connection...

340
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,235
The blood won't spread if you

341
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,863
don't resonate
strongly with Maka.

342
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,574
Come with me now...

343
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,701
...to the Black Room.

344
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:14,829
Let your souls sing
together in sweet harmony...

345
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,039
While the black blood runs

346
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:19,167
faster and stronger
throughout your veins.

347
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,794
[Soul]
I know I have to...

348
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,880
But do I have it in me?

349
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,592
[Soul]
The piano will play...

350
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:31,930
And the madness
will dance to the tune.

351
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,601
What do I do?

352
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,023
[Soul]
Listen, everyone...

353
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,650
We're going to
resonate as a team...

354
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,527
Using sound.

355
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,569
Using sound...?

356
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:47,612
But Soul do you even

357
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:49,114
know how to do
something like that?

358
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,281
I think so...

359
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,866
I thought of it a while ago,
back when we

360
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,869
first learned about
linking souls together.

361
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,246
Here's how it works...

362
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,540
Our wavelengths
communicate through Maka.

363
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,959
That's possible even here since

364
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,587
her soul perception
is so strong.

365
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:07,132
I still don't see how
we're supposed to resonate.

366
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:10,051
[Soul] I'll play the
piano with my soul.

367
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,219
The sound will resonate

368
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,680
directly with your
soul wavelengths.

369
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,893
[group laughs]

370
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:22,105
I don't get it...

371
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:24,065
Why's everyone laughing?

372
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,316
It's just that...

373
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,235
We've been trying
to come up with a plan...

374
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:28,528
...you never want to play...

375
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:30,655
So we were going
to trick you into it.

376
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,615
And now you're
offering to do it.

377
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,075
Unfortunately, we can only

378
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,286
stay in here for
five more minutes...

379
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,872
So the concert
will be a bit rushed.

380
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,248
Please play for us, Soul...

381
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,583
We're ready.

382
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,668
We've been looking
forward to this for awhile.

383
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,170
Yep!

384
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,766
What do you think?

385
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:03,730
Good crowd tonight.

386
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:05,398
[Li'l Demon]
Everything's in place...

387
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:09,152
The piano's all tuned up
and ready to be played.

388
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,408
[Soul]
That so?

389
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,955
♪ closing song ♪

390
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,127
[Maka] I haven't heard Soul
play in a long time.

391
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,171
[Black Star] It'll be funny
if he messes up.

392
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:52,130
[Maka]
Button your shirt...!

393
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,006
Sit up straight...!

00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:54,299
Hands in your lap!

[Black Star] Hey!
I'm not the one performing!

396
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,053
[Maka] Even audience members
should have manners...!

397
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,721
Look! Soul's about to begin!

398
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:00,972
[Black Star] All right,
let's hear it...!

399
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,016
Play to my soul, Soul...!

400
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,894
Uh... did I miss anything?

401
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,063
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

Unleash the Seven's
Chain Resonance

403
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:13,068
A Recital of
Destruction and Creation?o~

404
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,862
[Maka] Watch it,
or I'll take your soul!
