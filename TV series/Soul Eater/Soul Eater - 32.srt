the academy and Excalibur...

164
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:58,111
A worthy match-up.

165
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,905
I'll be joining the
fight as well, so you can

166
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:04,200
see my new abilities
up close and personal.

167
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:06,911
Excalibur!

168
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,997
[crowd murmurs]

169
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,877
Victory... and glory...

170
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:25,555
...are mine now!

171
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,187
He is somewhat intimidating.

172
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,607
When all is said and done,

173
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,067
the three of you will be
nothing more than a

174
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,737
footnote in the legend
of the Holy Sword Excalibur.

175
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,655
Shut uuuuuup!

176
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,074
Don't you remember
who you are?!

177
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,368
Hero wouldn't dare
talk like that!

178
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,452
My new name...

179
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,038
...is Hero the Brave.

180
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,916
I am Hero the Brave!

181
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,335
Oh yeah?!

182
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:56,753
Well, take this...!

183
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:59,339
Heaven's Strike,
Conan the Great!

184
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:03,259
[Hero] If you do
not follow the light...

185
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,971
...no blow you strike will
ever touch Hero the Brave.

186
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,103
[Kilik]
Now I'm getting fired up!

187
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:16,314
Pot of Fire... Triple F!

188
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,190
Liz. Patty...

189
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:19,025
Fire Styx Shot.

190
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:22,529
What?!

191
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,030
[Kid]
Where is he?

192
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:29,119
[Hero] With this...
you will be defeated.

193
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,287
Last move...

194
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,707
Hero the Atomic.

195
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,792
[huge blast]

196
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,427
[Unknown boy 1]
Awesome...

197
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,553
All he had to do was
name the technique,

198
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:48,263
and they were deep fried.

199
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,640
[Unknown boy 2]
I don't even know what he did.

200
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:53,435
So guys...

201
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,020
What do you think
about the new me?

202
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,022
Pretty powerful, aren't I?

203
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,942
[Death] And thus, the DWMA
was taken over by Hero,

204
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:04,529
former failed meister
and total loser.

205
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,823
What will become
of the academy now...?

206
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:10,410
You'll have to wait until
after the break to find out!

207
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:22,047
[girls screaming]

208
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:25,717
This is the perfect example

209
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,886
of my soon to be
legendary powers...

210
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,637
I've made it into
the girls' locker room.

211
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,348
[All]
Go away!!

212
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,436
[Kim and Jacqueline screaming]

213
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,937
What now?

214
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,691
Aw...! If you don't like it,

215
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:43,818
you'll have to find
a way to defeat me!

216
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:45,737
You dirty pervert!

217
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,746
Excalibur's not
in his usual spot.

218
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,207
[Fairies]
Finally! We're free!

219
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,250
[Fairies]
I can't believe he's gone!

220
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:05,590
[students murmur]

221
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:11,721
Everybody worships me
now that I'm Hero the Brave.

222
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,640
The ecstasy and
uncertainty of being

223
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:15,850
the chosen one is overwhelming.

224
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,687
He talks an awful lot about

225
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,814
being transformed
and that sort of thing...

226
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:23,733
But all that's really changed
is now he's a jackass.

227
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,489
[Maka]
It's Ox!

228
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:34,035
How could he do such an
awful thing to my beloved Kim?!

229
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,370
Hero, you're a dead man!

230
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,372
--[Soul] Ox!
--[Maka] Hold on a sec!

231
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:40,375
Calm down and
take a breath, Ox.

232
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,835
Look at those two.

233
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:42,961
I wonder how much longer

234
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,963
they'll be able to
pull this off.

235
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:46,006
[Ox]
We have to remember,

236
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,549
this is Hero.

237
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,009
He's a perpetual failure.

238
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:50,301
He'll get tired of the thousand

239
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:53,596
provisions and give up
before too much longer.

240
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,223
You're getting scary, Ox.

241
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:59,060
[Excalibur] The 1000 Provisions
of The Holy Sword Excalibur...

242
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,521
Number 22:
On a refreshing morning,

243
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:04,065
start out with a
refreshing greeting.

244
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,443
[rooster crows]

245
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:08,194
[Excalibur]
Hero...! Good morning!

246
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:10,572
And a very good
morning to you, Excalibur.

247
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,575
Now, let us begin another
great day shall we?

248
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,909
This day will never come again,

249
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:18,288
so we should spend
it together. Let's enjoy!

250
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,373
[Excalibur and Hero laugh]

251
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,595
I'll kill 'em!

252
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:35,805
[Excalibur] Number Four
Hundred and Fifty-Two...

253
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,057
Attendance at the five-hour

254
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,684
storytelling party is
absolutely mandatory.

255
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:42,312
[Excalibur]
Your twenties will be the

256
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:44,481
great transitional
period of your life...

257
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:47,150
It is a time of crossroads,
of immense change,

258
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,027
of incredible uncertainty...

259
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,780
Indeed, my twenties were
such a period for me...

260
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:54,324
That was when I evolved
from a no-good trouble maker

261
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:57,369
to the legendary sword
you see before you today...

262
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,371
Many men envied my hairstyle,

263
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,164
you see, and they were
inspired to copy it...

264
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:02,165
...and formed a fringe group...

265
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,750
...a sort of cult,
if you will...

266
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,337
...dedicated to the adoration
of my daring hairstyle...

267
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,588
They met every week...

268
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:09,714
...or was it every day...
...to discuss...

269
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:10,965
As you may have noticed,

270
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,509
humans are very young
from the time they are

271
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,552
born until some years later...

272
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,846
I, however, was born
old and wise,

273
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,349
and I would often discuss
abstract philosophical...

274
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,686
[Excalibur]
That is all!

275
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,771
[Hero clapping alone]

276
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,900
[Excalibur] Number Five
Hundred and Seventy-Eight:

277
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,444
The hero must never tell a lie.

278
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:33,780
[Holmes] So, what
you're telling me

279
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,865
is that you didn't
see anything?

280
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,910
That's correct I swear,
sir, I didn't see anything.

281
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,871
[Holmes] I see... But perhaps
you know something about someone

282
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,289
who did see something.

283
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,166
[Movie Lady] No, I don't know
anything about anybody

284
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,793
who saw anything anywhere.

285
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,169
[Holmes]
Is that so?

286
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,088
This is a complicated
case indeed...

287
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,173
You see, no one saw
you see nothing...

288
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,800
...so how can we confirm
that you don't know

289
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,885
anything or anyone anywhere?

290
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:56,761
[Watson]
Holmes...

291
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,430
...have you discovered anything?

292
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:01,141
[Holmes] Yes, I believe
I have a viable theory.

293
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,475
Indeed? What do you think?

294
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,519
[Excalibur]
This man is the culprit!

295
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,438
That's right...!

296
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:07,981
This man is the brother
of the girl who went missing

297
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,567
ten years ago and the author
of this terribly tragic tale

298
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,235
of revenge and murder.

299
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,988
Wow...! You figured it all out!

300
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,448

throw things...! Ow!

[Excalibur]
Number Two Hundred and Two:

304
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,538
Only the grandest
of toilets is acceptable.

305
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,843
It's grand, all right...

306
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,845
But did he have to put it here?

307
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,972
[Hero] This was the only
location with enough room.

[Excalibur] Number Six
Hundred and Sixty-Seven...

309

You will praise
Excalibur at all times.

310
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,607
Magnificent Excalibur!

311
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,402
Munificent Excalibur!

Magnanimous Excalibur!

[Excalibur] Number One Hundred
and Seventy-Two: Seek harmony.

314
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,079
Seek it thus...

315
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:06,539
First, a haircut.

316
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,583
No, stop! Hold it!

317
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,834
[Excalibur]
Number Seventy-Five:

318
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:13,672
Celebrate Excalibur's
birthday in grand style.

319
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,090
[Hero]
When is your birthday?

320
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:16,424
[Excalibur]
Every day!

00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,634
[All]
Lame!

322
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:18,802
Really...?!

323
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,387
