Yeah, it surprised me too...

164
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,625
I think... It looks like
the humans in there...

165
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,708
...are those guys
from this afternoon.

166
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,250
Oh, those idiots again...?

167
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,166
Why do we care what
happens to them?

168
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,666
I don't like them any
more than you do, Soul...

169
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,291
...but they're still human...

170
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,500
They're punks, but it's not

171
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,458
like their souls have
become Kishin eggs.

172
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,125
Let's just forget
about 'em, Maka...

173
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,500
It's Saturday night,
after all...

174
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,708
For all we know, maybe they've

175
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,416
just got a little
fever goin' on.

176
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,041
No, Soul... Now's not
the time for jokes...

177
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,541
We're representatives
of the academy...!

178
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,375
If we ignore it and
something bad happens...

179
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,083
...it'll be too late.

180
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,041
[Soul]
Okay, okay, you win...

181
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,125
We'll check it out.

182
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,208
But if we storm in there
and it ends up being a bunch

183
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,541
of people with Black Star

184
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,666
in the center saying
"welcome to my big show!"...

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,125
I'm gonna cry.

186
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,166
[Maka] I only
hope that's all it is.

187
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,750
[Soul]
Here we are...

188
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,291
Looks like we get to do
some sightseeing after all.

189
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,083
I do love gothic architecture;

190
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,208
this is one cool building.

191
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:49,250
[bell tolls]

192
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,125
Oh no...! Impossible!

193
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,375
Hey... what's wrong?

194
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,500
There's no way...

195
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,125
...not that quickly.

196
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,875
[Soul] Okay, slow down
a second, take a breath...

197
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,583
When you start acting like
this I can't keep up with you.

198
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,125
All gone.

199
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,875
[Soul]
What, the bell...?

200
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,500
Yeah, it stopped.

201
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,250
No, no... I'm talking about

202
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,125
the human souls
that were inside...

203
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,041
They disappeared suddenly...

204
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,958
Now there's just the
weapon and the meister.

205
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,000
[Maka thinks] Something tells me
that we should leave this door

206
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,958
closed and get out of here.

207
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,291
But I can't... I have to know...

208
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,875
As a student of the academy,

209
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,875
it's my duty to find
out what happened.

210
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,916
[doors creak]

211
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,208
[Crona]
You see...

212
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,708
They open one way...

213
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,666
Those doors only open inward.

214
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,125
What the hell...

215
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,041
He's in there all by himself...

216
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,125
What happened to
his weapon partner?

217
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,791
No, there's no way...

218
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,500
Now what?

219
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,708
[Ragnarok]
Lady Medusa...

220
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,083
It looks like two
others have arrived.

221
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:07,458
[Crona] Keep it down Ragnarok
you need to be quiet now.

222
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,083
[Maka] I'm reading the souls
of a meister and a weapon...

223
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,291
And both of them are
directly in front of us.

224
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,916
Which means...

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That meister standing there...
has a weapon inside his body.

226
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,791
[Death Scythe]
I screwed up.

227
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,416
Oh yeah...Maka isn't even
at school right now.

228
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,166
All this risk for nothing...

229
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,250
The only place to see Maka's
here at the academy,

230
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,458
so I came... Sure...

231
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,666
But coming here means
I might run into him.

232
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,458
Franken... Stein!

233
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,291
All I wanted was
to see my daughter!

234
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,750
Instead, I'm staring straight
in the face of danger!

235
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,000
But don't worry, Maka...

236
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,875
Your papa's not
going to back down!

237
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,416
I will overcome this obstacle,
and when I do,

238
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,916
you'll know how
much I love you!

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,750
You'll finally understand!

240
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,583
But before I do all that,

241
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,666
I need to have the lovely
school nurse heal my

242
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,000
wounded heart and
give me courage...

243
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,666
Oh yes!

244
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,625
I've been waiting
for you, my angel!

245
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,083
Hurry now and heal
my heart with your

246
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,041
sweet, sweet medical loving.

247
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,791
Kiss my pain away!

248
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,333
[Stein]
Hey there Spirit...

249
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,083
I've been looking for you.

250
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,333
Oh no...! Not Stein!

251
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,458
I don't know what
you want with me,

252
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,625
but all the scars from

253
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,708
your experiments
have finally disappeared!

254
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,166
I'm not afraid of you
anymore, so there...!

255
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,458
(Hah-hah!)

256
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,541
I'm not afraid of anything.

257
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
How do you like that, Stein...?

258
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,583
Then... I take it you noticed
that I swapped the middle toe

259
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,125
from your right foot with
the one on your left foot?

260
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,458
Huh?! What, are you nuts...?

261
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,541
How could you do
something like that to me?!

262
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,000
Made you look!

263
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,416
You know, that little
daughter of yours, Maka...

264
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,666
...she's growing
up quickly, huh?

265
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,333
I have to be honest, when I
heard you were getting married,

266
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,166
I wasn't so sure about it.

267
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,458
I thought to myself...

268
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,166
"there's no way this
is gonna work out." 

269
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,250
But then... I watched the
two of you together...

270
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,541
and you seemed so close
that I was reassured.

271
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,833
And then I thought...

272
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,916
"Those two have found a

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,833
love that is sure
to last forever."

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
[Death Scythe] Umm...
yeah... about that...

275
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,416
You may not know this yet...

276
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,250
...but Maka's mother and I...

277
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,625
...we actually got
divorced last month....

278
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,541
It's over between us.

279
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,500
I know.

280
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,750
Damn it! I'm gonna kill you,
you heartless patchwork freak!

281
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,625
[Stein]
Oh yeah, one other thing.

282
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,625
It seems the Demon
Sword has turned up.

283
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,083
[Death Scythe]
What?

284
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,166
[Soul] What are you
talking about, Maka?

285
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,333
You're telling me there's
a weapon inside that dude?

286
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,666
[Maka]
Not for long...

287
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,583
It's coming out.

288
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,375
[Crona screams]

289
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,416
[Ragnarok]
(Pea-goo-goo-goo)

290
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,500
(Goo-bee-bee)

291
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,958
That hurts me.

292
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,166
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

293
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,875
Stop moving around like that,
you're squeezing me!

294
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,333
Don't poke me! Ow!

295
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,291
Stop already.
Don't push my nose!

296
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,958
You're bruising me!

297
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,083
Stop it now...!

298
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,583
I've had enough already!

299
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,250
[Ragnarok] Now, now,
calm down, Crona...

300
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,250
You're so scary when
you're stressed out like this.

301
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,041
[Maka]
Okay...

302
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,583
...this is getting weird.

303
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,250
You should know that
the hunting of human

304
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,291
souls is strictly forbidden.

305
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,583
Are you students...?

306
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,666
I haven't seen
you at the academy.

307
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,791
At the where...?

308
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,166
What academy...?

309
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,000
Anyway, she said it was
okay to eat the human souls

310
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,250
I don't see what's
wrong with it,

311
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,958
if she said it was okay.

312
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,541
I'm, uh...

313
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,291
I'm not very good
at talking to girls...

314
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,958
They make me nervous.

315
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,000
Never mind that.

316
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,833
Her soul looks tasty.

317
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,125
[Maka] Meisters and their
weapons are not allowed to

318
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
collect human souls
for any reason...

319
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,041
We hunt only the souls that
have become Kishin eggs.

320
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,166
Now it's my duty to stop you...

321
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,750
You will not hunt any
more humans, you hear me?

322
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,250
[Ragnarok]
Let's get her, Crona.

323
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,291
It turned into a weapon...
a sword.

324
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,458
[Soul] He's gonna
strike from below!

325
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,500
Stop this!

326
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,541
You're going to start
poking at me also?

327
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,541
[Soul]
You've got 'em now!

328
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,125
[Medusa chuckles]

329
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,958
Did you think you
could cut him in half...?

330
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,958
Oh no... not with a
stroke like that one.

331
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,208
[Maka] Black...?
Black blood?

332
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,833
Yes... That's right.

333
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,875
My blood is black.

334
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,375
What's up with this guy...?

335
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,041
His body's way freaky.

336
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,750
I think I have an idea...

337
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,083
I don't know
how it's possible,

338
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,666
but I think his blood
itself is a weapon.

339
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,333
I was able to cut
through his skin...

340
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,541
but his blood hardened,

341
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,708
and the blade stopped

342
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,041
completely when I
hit his blood vessels.

343
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,291
Well if you're right,

344
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,750
then how do you propose
we go about beating him?

345
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,250
[Maka] None of our
normal attacks will work.

346
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,208
I'm not even sure
Witch Hunter will help...

347
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,583
If only I could shoot my

348
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,375
soul wavelength directly
at him like Black Star does,

349
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,208
I might be able to do
some internal damage.

350
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,958
Otherwise, I have no
idea what to do.

351
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:54,041
Crona... why are you
taking it so easy? Do something.

352
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,625
It's not like the ones before.

353
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,291
Those were boys. She's a girl.

354
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,458
I'm no good with girls.

355
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,833
What am I supposed
to do with her?

356
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
[Medusa laughs]

357
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,166
[Medusa]
How silly...

358
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,916
Kill her, of course.

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,208
What's with this guy...?

360
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,458
And who is he
talking to anyway?

361
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,666
Oh okay...

362
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,833
You're saying
I can kill the girl?

363
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,958
I didn't realize that!

364
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,291
But maybe I could
play with her hair first...

365
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,000
Just for a little while.

366
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,833
The doors here open inward...

367
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,625
They only open one way.

368
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,708
Ragnarok.

369
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,625
Screaming Resonance.

370
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,875
Goobee!

371
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,916
[Ragnarok screams]

372
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,500
He's coming Maka...

373
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,958
Guard now!

374
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,000
[Soul cries out]

375
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,041
Soul...!

376
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,708
Stop it!

377
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,541
Are you okay Soul...?

378
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,166
Talk to me!

379
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,333
You don't need to worry
about that right now...

380
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,000
I am your weapon
partner, Maka...

381
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,208
That means I am always

382
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,083
prepared to die
for my meister.

383
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,541
[Maka thinks]
What do I do now?

384
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,041
That screaming causes
vibrations along his blade,

385
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,333
and his blood
hardens so quickly.

386
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,958
I can't do any damage
to him at all...

387
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't even guard!

388
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
[Maka thinks]
I screwed up.

389
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,166
[Soul] What's
the matter, Maka...?

390
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,958
Quit dodging and
start fighting back!

391
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,666
[Ragnarok screams]

392
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,291
[Soul]
Maka!

393
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,208
[Maka thinks]
But if I do attack...

394
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,291
Then Soul...

395
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,041
I can't use Soul to
block his sword.

396
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,375
The only thing I can
do now is run away!

397
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,416
[Crona laughs]

398
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,125
We're getting out of here

399
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,291
Open up!

400
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,416
That's not going
to work, you know.

401
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,333
You should start paying

402
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,666
attention to the things
other people say.

403
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,291
Oh no!

404
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,916
[Crona] The doors
here only open one way...

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,791
They open inward.

406
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,458
Maka...! Stop him now!

407
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,791
But Soul, if I guard
you'll die...!

408
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,875
[Maka]
I screwed up.

[Crona] Do all

Please open your eyes...!

[Crona] The doors here
only open one way...

They open inward.

[Maka]
I'm sorry!

417
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,666
If I wasn't so weak then
this wouldn't have happened!

418
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,250
[Crona] I don't usually listen
to how people talk...

419
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,125
I don't think I can
deal with this situation.

420
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,083
[Maka] On the next
episode of Soul Eater...

421

Medusa the Witch...

The One Who Possesses
a Great Evil Soul?

423
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,625
[Crona] I don't know how to
deal with any of this.
