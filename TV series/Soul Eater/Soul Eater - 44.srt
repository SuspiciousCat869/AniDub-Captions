1
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,410
A sound soul...

2
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,620
...dwells within a sound mind...

3
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:50,415
...and a sound body.

4
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:00,842
Remind me again--
what exactly is your plan?

5
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:02,761
Finding Crona and the professor.

6
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:04,304
Yeah, I get that part...

7
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:07,932
What I want to know
is how you plan to do it.

8
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,434
Like I told you before...

9
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:12,854
I'm going to push my Soul
Perception ability to the limit.

10
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,064
Okay...

11
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:15,231
I'll filter it down...

12
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:17,108
...so I'm only
searching for Crona...

13
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,444
I'm sure I'll find
something that way.

14
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:20,862
Have you gone
outta your mind...?

15
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,906
How the hell are you
gonna pull that off?

16
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,616
I know what I'm doing...

17
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:27,869
Searching a wide spectrum
would be next to impossible.

18
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:30,955
So, instead...
I'll narrow down my search.

19
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,042
Even if he's far away, I'm
sure I'll be able to find him.

20
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,877
I'm not convinced it'll work.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,422
It'll work...
I still know Crona's wavelength.

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,219
You've always got an answer
for everything, don'tcha.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,846
Okay...

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,058
Now let's see if I can
find his wavelength.

25
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,892
Ready Soul?

26
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,602
Oh, yeah!

27
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,482
Let's go!
Soul Resonance!

28
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:15,709
♪ opening song ♪

29
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,678
Over there.

30
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,893
Over there.

31
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,231
Over there.

32
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:08,822
Over there.

33
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,532
It's this way.

34
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:28,758
Weakling Crona's
Determination...

35
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:32,178
For You, for Always
Being by My Side?

36
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,312
Over there.

37
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,814
This way.

38
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,060
Were you hoping to
make a grand entrance?

39
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:21,978
Something heroic?

40
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:37,327
I expected better
from my own child.

41
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:54,761
It looks like that's
all the work

42
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,346
we need to do around here...

43
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,430
Okay...

44
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:58,932
...which way to the Kishin?

45
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,768
We're too far ahead of the
rest of our forces, Black Star.

46
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,062
Let's head back and
regroup with the others.

47
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:05,146
That's not happening.

48
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,314
Huh?

49
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,525
Other people would
only get in my way...

50
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,360
Besides, turning tail
and running for cover

51
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,862
is beneath someone of
my superior talent.

52
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,239
You know?

53
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:16,199
Whatever you say.

54
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,993
Let's make sure
we do this right...

55
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,371
Academy orders were specific.

56
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:25,166
Baba Yaga Castle is located
in a cave in the jungle.

57
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,169
The first thing we need
to do is infiltrate the cave...

58
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:31,506
From there, we carefully
make our way to the castle...

59
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:33,591
There will likely be
ambushes set up along

60
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:36,761
the way that we'll
need to look out for.

61
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:38,054
That's the first phase.

62
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,639
Once we've made it
into the castle,

63
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,474
we'll wait for further
instructions.

64
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:42,642
Make sense?

65
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,477
So basically what you're
trying to tell me

66
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,521
is the Kishin is
inside that castle?

67
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:47,731
Right.

68
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,524
That makes things
simple enough...

69
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,443
Let's get going!

70
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,082
You're gonna have to run
a lot faster than that!

71
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,749
You hurt my feelings...

72
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,085
Why are you looking
at me like that, Crona?

73
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,628
So sad.

74
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,755
Lady Medusa I'm...

75
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,090
...here to...

76
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,508
The goal we've worked
toward together

77
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,968
for so long is finally
within sight...

78
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,930
At a time like this, how could
you doubt your own mother?

79
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,224
Because you're easy
to doubt Medusa.

80
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,267
You can hardly blame Crona...

81
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:10,188
You just tried to kill him
without so much as saying hello.

82
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,356
Oh my...

83
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,692
You're one of the
academy's teachers, yes?

84
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:15,610
Not anymore, I'm afraid.

85
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:20,240
Unfortunately for you,
I left the DWMA recently.

86
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,992
Which means that little deal you
worked out with the academy...

87
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:25,495
...it doesn't apply to me.

88
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:26,830
Oh, is that so...?

89
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:28,248
I simply can't imagine what

90
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,709
a former teacher
would want with me.

91
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,211
I'm here to bring Stein back.

92
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,882
You should hear yourself talk.
How amusing!

93
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,759
I don't see what's so funny!

94
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:41,428
You don't, poor dear...?

95
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,055
It's just that you sounded
so hopeless and pathetic.

96
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,725
A pitiful, abandoned woman.

97
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,894
Well, putting that aside ...

98
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:51,813
Death should be
ashamed of himself...

99
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,649
First, he fails to uphold
his end of our bargain...

100
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,986
...then he sends a child to
finish off his own mother.

101
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,405
If you're looking for sympathy,
you won't get any from me.

102
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,950
You brought this down
on yourself, Medusa.

103
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,077
So, Crona...

104
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:08,830
The academy sent you
after me, and you came...

105
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:12,042
But now that you're
here what will you do?

106
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:21,551
I'm curious.
Why did you volunteer to come?

107
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:23,887
I need to put an end to this.

108
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,973
But do you really understand
what that means?

109
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:34,439
Before this is all over, you may
have to kill your own mother.

110
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:38,610
This decision can't be
easy for you to make.

111
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:42,572
There's no other way...
I understand that now.

112
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,657
I run...

113
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,910
...that's all I
know how to do...

114
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:50,080
I turn away from whatever
seems too difficult...

115
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:52,457
...anything I can't deal with.

116
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,751
Like when I lied
to you before...

117
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,170
...and when Professor
Stein went missing...

118
00:09:57,253 --> 00:10:00,131
I should have
taken responsibility.

119
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,509
I wish I could believe you.

120
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,261
But I can't, not yet...

121
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:06,930
It's not an easy
thing to regain the

122
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:08,973
trust of someone
you've betrayed...

123
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:12,102
I won't be able to forgive
you until we've found Stein...

124
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:15,105
...until we've brought
him home again.

125
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:17,023
As Stein's partner, I
don't trust you to

126
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,233
save him on your own...

127
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,151
I can't be completely
sure how you'd react

128
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,904
once you reached
Medusa's hideout...

129
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,073
Can you do it, Crona?

130
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,494
I have to.

131
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,959
Are you going to
answer me, Crona?

132
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,629
I'm here to...

133
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:48,263
I'm here to...

134
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:56,771
I'm here to help someone
who's important to me.

135
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,068
Someone who's been there
for me no matter what.

136
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:05,572
I'm here to...
I'm here to stop you, Medusa!

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,700
How disappointing.

138
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:11,786
After all I've done,
I expected better from you...

139
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,664
Are you sure you
won't reconsider?

140
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:16,332
He's sure.
Accept it.

141
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,876
This is hopeless, you know...

142
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,836
No matter what you try,
the two of you don't

143
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,713
have enough power to hurt me...

144
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:25,091
...and there's no way Stein's
ever coming back with you.

145
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,387
He has no reason
to leave me, you see.

146
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,139
He's here of his own free will.

147
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,640
Liar!

148
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,439
Careful. You're beginning
to sound pitiful again.

149
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:44,736
I won't let you get to me...
I know what you are.

150
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:45,779
You're poison.

151
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,948
Every word from
your mouth is a lie!

152
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,867
I'm not lying about this...

153
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,912
You can give yourself all the
empty reassurances you want...

154
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,955
...but the fact
remains that Stein

155
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,249
is never coming back to you.

156
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,460
He's all mine now,
body and soul...

157
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,628
What makes you think you

158
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:04,297
have the right to tear
him away from me?

159
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,758
What are you to Stein anyway?

160
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,218
This is making me sick...

161
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,178
You've said enough, now shut up!

162
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,555
I'm sure there's no
need to remind you...

163
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,310
...but any damage you inflict on
this body won't hurt just me.

164
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:20,438
Rachel will also
suffer any pain.

165
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:23,441
Is there any low
you won't sink to?

166
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,485
Let's recap the situation.

167
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:28,863
You can't do anything that
would cause me physical harm...

168
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,281
...because that would
mean injuring

169
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:33,618
an innocent little
girl as well...

170
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,912
Of course I can still hurt you.

171
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:42,252
Something tells me I'll
enjoy this more than you will.

172
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,020
Ribbit.

173
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,439
What am I supposed to do
if the academy brings

174
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:05,442
the battle all the
way into the castle?

175
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:07,110
Mizunes!

176
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,820
Chee-chee-chee.

177
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:10,071
Right...

178
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,781
...everything on Free's
end is still the same...

179
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,033
I understand...

180
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:15,118
Let me know if
there are any changes.

181
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:16,619
Chee-chee.

182
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:22,334
Medusa gets to watch all this
from the comfort of her home!

183
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,336
I'll never forgive her
if she's taking a nap

184
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:26,921
while I'm here
dealing with this.

185
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:28,590
Now...

186
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:29,924
...would you like
to get started...?

187
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,760
Ready when you are...

188
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,596
We're eager to end this, too.

189
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,350
Why the face?
Not so confident now, are you?

190
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,477
You're confused, aren't you...?

191
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,688
How can I be acting
so calm and collected?

192
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:48,568
You're also asking yourself
why, of all people,

193
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,528
Crona and I were the
ones sent here.

194
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:51,196
Isn't that right?

195
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,489
No need to be coy.

196
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:55,283
If you have something
to say, say it.

197
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,701
See?

198
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:59,120
You really want to know,
don't you...? Oh, all right...

199
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,705
You're bluffing...

200
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,457
What can you possibly
hope to accomplish

201
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,417
without a partner to help you?

202
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,294
You just don't get it,
do you...?

203
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,131
You're fighting a
Death Scythe now.

204
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,634
A former Death Scythe.
Didn't you quit?

205
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:13,885
Let's do this, Crona.

206
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,387
Right.

207
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:21,226
Very well, I can toy
with you for a bit.

208
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:22,477
Are you sure you
want to do this?

209
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,853
I don't think it's a good idea.

210
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,605
What other choice do we have...?

211
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:27,774
I made my decision.
It hasn't changed.

212
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:30,860
There are gonna to
be consequences.

213
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,487
Yes, I know that.

214
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,406
Vector Arrow!

215
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,119
Nice try!

216
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,917
How about a Vector Plate?

217
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:54,551
What's she doing?

218
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,433
What was that light?

219
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:10,233
The way he's moving
He's not fighting for real.

220
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,235
He isn't trying to hurt me.

221
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:15,113
Which means they must
have some other strategy.

222
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,823
Vector Arrow.

223
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,875
It's not too late
to stop this, Crona.

224
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,376
I'm tired...

225
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,628
...of hating
myself all the time.

226
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,757
And I'm tired...

227
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,385
...of betraying the
people I care about.

228
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,637
Most of all...

229
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:43,266
I'm tired of being some
tool for you to use.

230
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,976
Poor Crona...

231
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,773
Do you even know
what you're saying...?

232
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:52,901
You'll always be mine.
Nothing can change that.

233
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:53,735
No...!

234
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,070
No, you're wrong!

235
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:58,531
You're really still a good
little kid, aren't you?

236
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:00,533
I'm not!

237
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:03,495
Your whole life, you've
listened to what I said...

238
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:07,248
You would do anything
I told you to do.

239
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,919
Because I've always been the
only one who was there for you.

240
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,629
That's different now.

241
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,383
Why bother denying
the obvious...

242
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,968
You would never betray me...

243
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,553
How could you?

244
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,181
After all...

245
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,811
No matter what's happened...

246
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:33,441
You're still my child.

247
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,527
I don't care!

248
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,696
Child or not...

249
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,699
I have no choice
but to kill you!

250
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,493
I've given you so
much over the years...

251
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:46,996
...yet you still want
to see me dead.

252
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,874
But that's not going
to happen...

253
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,961
No, I'm afraid I can't let
you kill me just yet...

254
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,796
We're about to see the
dawn of a new world,

255
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,133
and I have no intention
of missing that.

256
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,301
So...
How about this...

257
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,388
I'll go ahead
and kill you instead.

258
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:05,390
Medusa!

259
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,517
Vector Arrow!

260
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,894
Stay out of it...

261
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:13,440
You really shouldn't meddle
in other people's family issues.

262
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:15,066
Some family!

263
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,943
Besides, you have more
pressing matters

264
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,403
to deal with at the moment...

265
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:21,614
Like defeating him,
for instance.

266
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,116
Stein!

267
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:25,618
Marie!

268
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:28,371
You know who I am...?!
That means--

269
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,457
Why are you still alive?

270
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,294
Why're you here?
You're supposed to be dead.

271
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:38,923
What are you talking about...?

272
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,676
What made you think I was dead?

273
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,178
Oh I see...

274
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,972
I guess that must've been
another one of my nightmares...

275
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:48,391
The delusions that
come with the madness...

276
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,226
...attacking me from
the inside out until

277
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,230
all of my lofty ideals
crumble into dust.

278
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,107
Stein!

279
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,776
Please, Marie...

280
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,403
...please get out of my sight.

281
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,572
I don't know how much longer

282
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:04,616
I can keep myself
from dissecting you!

283
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,284
No!

284
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,786
Be careful...

285
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,413
I wouldn't let that woman
come any closer if I were you...

286
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:13,541
Who knows what
she might be planning?

287
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,752
Oh...
I do know.

288
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:18,838
I know what she's capable of...

289
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:22,092
I'm familiar with the
skills she possesses.

290
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,426
I've seen them...

291
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,928
I've seen them all.

292
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,805
Then let's take care
of them together...

293
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,432
The new world order
demands it of us...

294
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,810
My handy Vector Blade.

295
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,563
It was a cute little
rebellion while it lasted,

296
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,732
Crona, but it's all over now.

297
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,117
Stein, n--

298
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,121
Get back on your feet, idiot!

299
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:55,166
If you die, so do I!
I won't let that happen!

300
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,504
This is what all that
talk about killing me

301
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,047
comes to in the end...?

302
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:03,174
Of course, I knew
you wouldn't deliver.

303
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:06,636
At least you provided me
with some entertainment.

304
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,769
Where am I?

305
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,938
What path should I take...?

306
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,606
Move ahead...?

307
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,901
Join the new order that's
waiting to be born...?

308
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,319
Or turn back...

309
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,447
...to the old world...?

310
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,574
Am I still stable...

311
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:31,327
...or am I being consumed
by the madness?

312
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:34,414
Is this the truth
that I'm seeing...

313
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:38,752
...or the fabricated
delusions of insanity?

314
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:42,213
Water ever flows from
higher elevations

315
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,257
down to lower ground...

316
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:47,302
More and more water
collects in one place...

317
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,763
...forming a river.

318
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:53,725
So it is too with
the lives of men.

319
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:57,520
Set in their ways, they hate
the loss of the old order...

320
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,522
They fear change.

321
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:00,940
But...

322
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:03,735
...what if it's better to
fall from higher ground...

323
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:06,738
...to join the new river.

324
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:10,283
Old or new, everything
is controlled by the order...

325
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,410
...but that's okay...

326
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,955
...the only thing
I need right now is...

327
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,419
"...to obey the new rules."

328
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,217
I'm begging you, Stein!

329
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,095
Please listen to me!

330
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,471
I can't.

331
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,723
There's something else
I need to do at the moment.

332
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,226
I'm going to cut you open now!

333
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:44,359
What happened to
your defiance, Crona?!

334
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,820
Now, Ragnarok!

335
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,530
Goobee!

336
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:51,908
I know what you just did...

337
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:54,494
You think hardening the black
blood will make you safe...?

338
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,955
So wrong.

339
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,628
Have you forgotten
who you're dealing with...?

340
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:07,298
I'm the one who made you
what you are in the first place.

341
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,553
Cron--

342
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:14,723
Wake up, moron...!

343
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,018
This isn't good...!
Pull yourself together!

344
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,441
Go Bloody Needle!

345
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,818
It didn't...

346
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:28,903
Oh, don't tell me you
still haven't noticed...

347
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,321
Let me explain it to you.

348
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,741
You see, I hit you with
my soul wavelength.

349
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:36,411
Which, in turn, has made your
wavelengths significantly

350
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,956
less stable, thereby rendering
you virtually helpless.

351
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,208
You can't even use
Bloody Needle...

352
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:46,504
...and you will temporarily be
unable to harden your blood.

353
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:48,340
Which means it'll be
very easy indeed for

354
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,425
me to cut you into pieces...

355
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,010
See it now?

356
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,637
This is the end.

357
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:57,432
It's time you die!

358
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:15,784
Medusa!!

359
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:21,414
♪ closing song ♪

360
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:50,378
I won't hesitate, hold back,
or run away anymore...

361
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,546
I understand now.

362
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,048
I know what's important to me.

363
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:53,798
Is it love?

364
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,175
Well...
...um...

365
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:55,967
...yeah...

366
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:56,968
And friendship?

367
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,553
Uh...
I uh...

368
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,138
Spit it out already...

369
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,349
I thought you weren't going
to hesitate anymore.

370
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:03,558
Isn't that what you said?

371
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,643
I'm sorry!
This is hard!

372
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,479
On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

373
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:09,189
Anti-Magic Wavelength...

374
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,775
Fierce Attack,
The Anger-Filled Genie Hunter?

375
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,151
Watch it, or I'll...

376
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,903
You'll what?
