[Stein] Like I told
you all last week,

125
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,514
we're going to be starting
a new lesson today,

126
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:46,558
so I hope you're ready.

127
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:47,892
As you know,

128
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,894
the Kishin's madness has
woken the witch Arachne...

129
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:51,312
And with her revival,

130
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:55,775
the organization Arachnophobia
is once again active.

131
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:58,945
So now it's time to
learn about Duel Arts.

132
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:03,158
It's simpler if I don't
explain it in words.

133
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,119
This lesson you'll learn
by doing, not listening.

134
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:09,039
Some of you are slower
than others, so we'll see.

He was looking at
us when he said that!

136
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,878
You aren't even really
embarrassed, are you?

137
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,129
All right, if I call your name,

138
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:18,715
please step to the
front of the classroom...

139
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,675
First up we have
Ox and Harvar...

140
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,302
Get down here.

141
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:25,055
Our newly recovered
student... Maka...

142
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,264
Sweet!

143
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,475
...with Soul, of course.

144
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,768
Lastly...

145
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,228
Black Star... get back in here.

146
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,271
In or out?

147
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,565
Make up your
mind already, woudja?

148
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,817
Uh... why are you all sweaty?

149
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:39,277
I'm concerned you may

150
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,988
destroy the classroom if you
use your weapon for this.

151
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,115
So you're on your own.

152
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,117
Up until this point,

153
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,786
your training
in resonating souls

154
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:50,497
has been exclusively with
your respective partners.

155
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,665
But the fact of the
matter is, you're still kids.

156
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:55,460
A single soul resonance likely
won't be enough against the

157
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:58,296
type of enemy we're facing now.

158
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,173
So, what I'm going to
teach you today is how to

159
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:03,843
work together to
resonate souls as a team.

160
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,388
All five of us are supposed
to match wavelengths?

161
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,182
I realize this is
a new concept for you...

162
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,892
...but give it a try anyway.

163
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,977
Come after me
with all you've got.

164
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,106
Already...? Just like that?

165
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:20,985
Bring it on...

166
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,029
I'll dissect you all.

167
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,281
Creepy!

168
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:27,367
Hell yeah!!

169
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,246
[Rachel]
Where's breakfast, Mommy?

170
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,455
I'm hungry!

171
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,708
Yes, I know you are dear...

172
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,793
It'll be ready soon.

173
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,297
There's plenty left
over for seconds.

174
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:43,800
It looks so yummy!

175
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,977
I guess it was my
imagination after all.

176
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:05,655
This is the best
Mother can do?

177
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:08,700
What a pathetically
boring and tasteless meal.

178
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,454
There's a spider...!

179
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,040
How did that filthy
thing get in here...?

180
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,334
Go on, get out now.

181
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:28,428
Arachne... It didn't take
her very long to notice.

182
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:30,430
Rachel what...?

183
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:32,349
Mommy...!

184
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:34,893
I'm going outside to play.

185
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,520
Hold it, Rachel!

186
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:38,897
Where are you going?

187
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,649
A good friend of mine
is waiting for me...

188
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,401
Let go.

189
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,779
Wait... who are you...?

190
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,781
You're not Rachel.

191
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,157
[Medusa switches to her
voice] What a bad mother,

192
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,035
treating your own daughter
like she's a stranger.

193
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:54,287
She's such a
good little girl, too...

194
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,831
...and so easily controlled.

195
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,168
No...!

196
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:07,342
Don't forget to lock
the doors and windows.

197
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,345
If they're open, snakes
and spiders will get in.

198
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,639
We don't want that.

199
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,349
Bye-bye, Mommy.

200
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:20,397
[Rachel's mother]
Rachel!

201
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,837
I have no idea how
this is done... Do you?

202
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,046
No clue...

203
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,215
But Stein's not messing
around this time...

204
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,759
We're just gonna have
to figure something out.

205
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,555
Let's go.

206
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:54,347
I still don't see how we're
supposed to match wavelengths

207
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:56,349
with these guys, but okay.

208
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,905
Die, you mad scientist wacko!

209
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,618
Four-eyed freak!

210
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:18,079
Anybody else want
in on the fun...?

211
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,164
Don't over think it.

212
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,749
It won't do you any good.

213
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:24,252
I can barely think at all with
this many people watching us.

214
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,962
Damn you--

215
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,341
All right... My turn!

216
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:35,013
Royal Thunder!

217
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,310
[Ox]
Huh?

218
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:41,978
Do you have
a death wish... huh?!

219
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,313
Hey man it's your own fault.

220
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:45,190
You're the one who jumped
in front of my attack.

221
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:46,775
Move it!

222
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,574
Maka...

223
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:55,992
You damn idiot!

224
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,911
My bad! Sorry, Black Star.

225
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,914
Royal Thunder!

226
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:06,002
[Ox]
Huh?

227
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,754
[laughing in classroom]

228
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,214
How pathetic.

229
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,802
That was even worse
than I'd expected.

230
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:15,887
I'm done with this.

231
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:17,806
[Black Star]
Professor,

232
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,099
I'm gonna beat the
crap out of Ox now.

233
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:21,017
Will you act
as fight supervisor?

234
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,561
[Stein] Save your
fighting for after class.

235
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,146
[Ox]
Whatever you say, Professor.

236
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,525
But Black Star and I are gonna
have to settle this eventually.

237
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,443
[Stein]
Why do I bother?

238
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:31,653
Do you think you stand

239
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,489
a chance against the
Royal Thunder Commander?

240
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,369
[Black Star]
Shut up!

241
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:43,206
That makes eleven straight
victories for Black Star.

242
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,791
But is it really a
victory if your

243
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,418
opponent was that pathetic?

244
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:47,419
[yelling in the classroom]

245
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,712
[Stein] I ask them
to work together

246
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,630
and they beat each
other up instead...

247
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:52,799
So much for that.

248
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,467
Even if we had all
the time in the world,

249
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:56,428
it still may not be enough...

250
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,471
They don't seem to get it.

251
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:02,350
[Naigus] What do
you think Lord Death's

252
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,520
reason is for keeping the
Book of Eibon in the vault?

253
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:08,231
[Sid] If he wanted us to know,
he would've told us...

254
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,941
Let it go.

255
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,074
This is Lord Death's
personal collection...

256
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:21,202
There's some pretty
frightening stuff down here.

257
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,840
Now, there's no
need to be shy...

258
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,508
Go ahead and drink it up.

259
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:38,720
A glass of fresh blood
should do the trick.

260
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:39,679
[Mosquito]
Thank you...

261
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:42,390
It's an honor, Lady Arachne.

262
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,893
[Giriko] Of course,
it might be poisoned.

263
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:50,315
I'm joking...

264
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,108
We can't kill you quite yet.

265
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,319
Unfortunately, we have to
keep you around if we want

266
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,654
to get the Book of Eibon back.

267
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,454
Forgive me, my lady.

268
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,622
The plans for the Magic Tool

269
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:08,083
were lost because of
my incompetence...

270
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,250
You can make it up to

271
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,503
me by doing better
next time, Mosquito...

272
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,047
Anyway, at least one good
thing came of your failure.

273
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,299
We were able to
test Mifune's abilities.

274
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,801
Yes... and I believe we'll

275
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,887
be able to put his
power to good use.

276
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:25,684
Is that your big plan...?

277
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,352
What good are you if
that's the only thing

278
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:30,522
you can come up with?

279
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:33,483
[Mosquito] I suggest you
watch your tone with me.

280
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:39,739
Got it, chainsaw boy?

281
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,157
My chains are getting dull.

282
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,993
Maybe I should sharpen
them on your body, old man.

283
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:45,704
Just try it!

284
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,039
I'll drain every drop of blood

285
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:51,835
from your body until you're
an empty sack of skin.

286
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:02,429
Police Stinger!

287
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:04,806
Yeah, fly away little bug.

288
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,398
That's all you can do...?

289
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,441
I hate to break it to you,

290
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,484
but you're past your prime.

291
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:23,324
Then maybe you'd like
to take a look at my form

292
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,577
from eight hundred years ago.

293
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,080
This is my Three-Piece
Police Stinger!

294
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,250
There's nothing better
than reclaiming

295
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,585
lost youth, is there...?

296
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,171
Shall I snap a picture for you?

297
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:37,672
Whatdya say?

298
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,301
Of course, it'll be an
awkward portrait with you

299
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:44,137
cut up into little bits and all.

300
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,847
You young punk!

301
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,558
Old fool!

302
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:51,644
[fighting sounds]

303
00:17:57,984 --> 00:17:59,986
[Eruka]
Lady Arachne!

304
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,949
Yes, what is it now?

305
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,452
[Eruka] There's a guest
waiting to see you.

306
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:12,040
[Arachne]
A guest...? Who is it?

307
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,042
[Eruka] Forgive me,
Lady Arachne...

308
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,337
...but she keeps insisting
that she's your little sister.

309
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,007
I see... Very well...

310
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,134
Show her in.

311
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,428
[Arachne chuckles]

312
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,993
[Arachne]
My, my. Look at you.

313
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:52,455
What an adorable body you
found this time, Medusa.

314
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,707
[Medusa]
How sweet that you still

315
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,167
remember me after
eight hundred long years.

316
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,669
[Arachne]
How could I forget you...?

317
00:18:57,752 --> 00:18:59,921
I always make sure
to keep you in my sights,

318
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,008
no matter how
many centuries pass.

319
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:06,553
[Medusa] It seems you're still
as good a spy as ever Arachne.

320
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:08,638
[Arachne] You haven't
changed a bit, either...

321
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,890
Still barging in here
without warning,

322
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,018
not showing an ounce of fear.

323
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,061
You'll never learn, will you...?

324
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,647
Not even in that dreadful
new form you have.

325
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,442
Oh, but you can get away
with a lot in this body.

326
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,154
I find your determination
truly inspiring.

327
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,238
You were badly hurt

328
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,032
during that fight
at the academy...

329
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,533
Your soul was torn into pieces,

330
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:31,077
but here you stand,
alive and well.

331
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,998
I knew there was one thing
I had to avoid at any cost.

332
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,125
At no point could I allow
Stein and Death Scythe

333
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,918
to swallow my soul.

334
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:41,963
When I took that final blow...

335
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,049
I split my soul into pieces...

336
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,258
...entered a snake...

337
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,384
...and repaired myself,

338
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,304
so that I could
return once more.

339
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,097
[Arachne] That was
a dangerous move,

340
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,767
even for a powerful
witch like yourself...

341
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,852
You survived out of sheer luck.

342
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,395
[Medusa]
You're probably right...

343
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,230
The revival of the Kishin Asura

344
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:02,150
caused the release of
strong madness wavelengths...

345
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:05,779
My magic was able
to feed off of their power.

346
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:08,698
It's likely I wouldn't
survive that again.

347
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,619
[Arachne] So what brings
you here, Medusa?

348
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:15,455
I fought the Grim Reaper
eight hundred years ago until,

349
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:16,873
at the very end of the battle...

350
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:19,501
...someone betrayed me.

351
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,877
You think you can just drop

352
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,922
in here and leave again
without paying a price?

353
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,549
It's silly to cling to
the past like that...

354
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,843
The two of us should be friends.

355
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:33,139
We're a pair of newly
revived sisters, after all.

356
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:49,531
[Medusa laughs]

357
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:50,907
How thoughtful!

358
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,827
A surprise party to welcome
me back to the world?

359
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,537
But it's so sudden,
and I'm afraid

360
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,872
I'm no good at parties.

361
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,541
I'll see you again soon, though,

362
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,710
dear sister of mine.

363
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,006
She always was
an obnoxious girl.

364
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,426
[Eruka] I'll see
her out, my lady.

365
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,015
Are you sure... about her?

366
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:18,268
I'll let her play her
games for awhile.

367
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:22,814
In the end she'll be caught
in my web like everybody else.

368
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,485
[Eruka]
You can't just show up

369
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,612
here like that whenever
you want to, Medusa...!

370
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:30,613
If you're not careful,

371
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,741
you're going to
get me discovered!

372
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,160
You'll continue surveillance
as instructed.

373
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,620
Is that understood... Eruka?

374
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,122
[Eruka]
Yes ma'am.

375
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:44,461
I thought after this
she'd finally let me go!

376
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:47,756
[Medusa] Freedom
always comes at a price.

377
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,715
[Eruka]
So... uh...

378
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:51,468
...what're you going to do now?

379
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,595
I'm borrowing this.

380
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:57,015
I have to retrieve something
precious that I left behind.

381
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,643
In Death City.

382
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:21,206
♪ closing song ♪

383
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,209
Maka here.

384
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,919
Next week Kid and the
others get in big trouble.

385
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:51,004
Medusa here.

386
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:52,380
As you can see,
due to popular demand,

387
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,256
I've returned!

388
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,382
[Maka] I like studying.

389
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,592
[Medusa] I like experiments.

390
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:56,885
[Maka]
I do the Maka Chop.

391
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,470
[Medusa] I lie and
hurt people a lot.

392
00:23:58,553 --> 00:23:59,846
[Maka]
It may be hard to believe,

393
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,349
but next week you'll see
we have something in common.

394
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,309
[Medusa] Hmm,
how should we put this?

395
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,770
[Both] Neither of us is
in the next episode!

396
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,688
[Medusa] On the next episode
of Soul Eater...

397
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:10,565
The Red Hot Runaway Express!

398
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:13,318
o~A Magic Tool Left
Behind by the Grand Wizard?o~

399
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,110
[Maka]
Watch it...

400
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:16,154
...or I'll take your soul!
