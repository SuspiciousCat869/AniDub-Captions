[knocking]

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.476 position:50% align:center
Hi. How's it going?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Were you sleeping? My bad.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
So you're really moving in here?

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Isn't it obvious?

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
The entire room's filled
with my boxes, genius!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
Uh. I am. Sorry to
barge in like this.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
I heard you got to bunk solo
by winning rock paper scissors?

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
But now that I'm here...
Heh. That's gotta be annoying.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
You're not wrong.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
I know this is
unexpected and all,

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
so I don't blame
you if you're mad.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
Say, that reminds me.
I thought things might be

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
awkward since I'm
older than you.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
But we're technically
in the same year,

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:58.266 position:50% align:center
so we can keep it casual.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
Sure. Whatever you say, man.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
A little too casual.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
Move it.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
Just trying to leave.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
Oh. Don't let me stop you.
Go right ahead!

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50% align:center
I recommend a
protein powder to him,

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
and guess what he says to me!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
Um, what?

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
Out of nowhere he comes
at me with this crap:

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
"You trying to make a comment

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
about the way I lift,
or something?"

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
Just like that. He decides
to make it personal.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
All because I tried to talk to
him about supplements!

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
What did he think I was
trying to body shame him?

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
Get over yourself! Ugh.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
That sounds... annoying.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] I know, right? I was
making friendly conversation.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
Now we don't even talk
when we're in the same room.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
Dead silence.
Oh, I cannot stand it!

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Stressful stuff, dude.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
Ya know, he was never
this hard to get along with

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
back in high school.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
Wait. Was he?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Maybe I just didn't
notice it at the time.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
Is it possible he's always
hated me? No way.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Who knows?

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Uh. Thanks, meathead.
That grunting is super helpful.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if you're
even listening to me.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah, um, not tryna be rude,

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
but my hands are kinda
full at the moment.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
Literally. So, uh, maybe we
can talk about this later?

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI gasps]

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
By the way, when are
you going to get

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
on top of things and join
the starting lineup again?

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
You've been grinding away on
the dang B Team for three weeks.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
I know you're mad,

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
but this isn't the time
or place to go in on me!

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50% align:center
Seiichirou. Don't just
stand there, help me out!

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
--Natsu.
--[IBUKI groans]

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
We've managed to win
our games without him.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
He doesn't need to be there
right now. So don't worry.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
That is not what I meant
by "help me out," Seichirou.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be my
spotter, my foundation,

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
my rock! Ugh! You two are
the worst, you know that?

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
So?

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
Come on. Say it.
Say you're proud of me.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.783 position:50% align:center
Isn't the team stand-off

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
supposed to wear
jersey number ten.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
If you think playing as number
20 is your true calling

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
you're totally ignoring
your potential.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
And that's nothing to
be excited about. Hmph.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI gasping]

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
Well, that was brutal.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
He didn't have to be
such a jerk about it.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
I can't believe he
dragged you like that.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I'm proud of you!

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI groans]

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
Sousuke. You still haven't
broken in your mouthpiece?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh. No. Not yet.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
You'll be fine, bro.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're gonna
get tackled much today.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
Remember the last time
we played these nerds?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
True. Still,
I'm not feeling too hot

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
since I was up way
too late last night.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking, man?
The night before a match?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
Ah, I may as well catch
some Z's on the way.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
Natsusa. Wake me up
when we're there.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Look at this.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
Well, apparently I need to
remind you that there's a line

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
marking the edge of a single
seat. Again, it's right there.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
As you can see, each of you

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
are currently
taking up enough space

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
for at least one
and a half people,

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
which is the equivalent of four
and a half adult bodies.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
Don't you realize
the three of you

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
are larger than
the average person?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
You should be more considerate.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
At the very least, you could
make an attempt and do your best

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
not to man-spread
like a bunch of jerks.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
I mean, have you ever thought

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
that a show of effort
might go a long way

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
to make other people on the
train feel more comfortable?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
I mean just look at you,
you're leaning on the rails,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
you're crossing your legs,
you're spreading out your junk

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
like a bunch of entitled tools

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
who can't be bothered to
act like decent humans.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
Like what's up with that?

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
Are your legs programmed
to splay open every time

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
ya sit down? And don't get
me started on the stupid,

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
loud conversations you
always end up having

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
that none of us have the luxury
of not listening to.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
Am I crystal? Am I clear?
Is any of this getting through?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
Be nice if people were
more self-aware.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Sorry.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
He just ripped them a new one.
Scary. Must be in a bad mood.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is he?

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
No wonder you're able
to put up with him.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
It all just goes over your head.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
Natsusa usually seems like
such a friendly guy to me.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
He's never snapped at you
like that, has he?

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
No, he's never been
anything less than kind.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
Though, he does always
seem to be mad at Ibuki.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
And the other big dogs.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
He was always super nice
to his younger classmates

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50% align:center
back in high school, too.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
Wasn't he, Yasunari?

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
Hey, earth to Yasunari.

[FUUGA]
Uh, right. Sorry.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
You've got an attitude, huh?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
You think it's cool
to act like a jackass?

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center

You handled that
really well, Taisei.

The younger guys
really respect you.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
From the look of things,
it's only a matter of time

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
until you're the
next captain here.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI]
It's too early to say that.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
Hey, remember when you led
the team back in high school?

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
That sure was a great year.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
You know, I don't
necessarily agree with that.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
Actually, I liked it more
when you were in charge.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
Taisei came off a
bit too aggressive.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
Well, I only made captain
as a last resort, so...

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Natsusa Yuzuki?

Holy cow. It's actually you!

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you. Oh.
My name is Ryuusei Hiyoshi!

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, it's a pleasure.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
Can I shake your hand?
I'm such a big fan!

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Uh, sure.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
You know, I used to
go to dance lessons.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
But I decided to
switch over to rugby

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.180 position:50% align:center
after I saw how
amazing you were!

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's awesome?

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center
I read this magazine
interview that said you took

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
movement classes when
you were younger,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
and I remember you were talking

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
about how it helped you
improve your step work!

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
That's what inspired me
to try out sports, too!

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
Wow, you don't say.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
But I never had any
formal dance training.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
I was copying my cousin's moves
'cause they looked cool.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Really? That's so rad!

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[ISUI A]
Ryuusei, what are you doing?

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
Look who I found.
It's really him. Natsusa Yuzuki!

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
[ISUI A]
All right, pipe down.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
You're making a
spectacle of the poor guy.

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry. You're a big
celebrity, so I thought

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
you'd be used to fans
gushing over you.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have assumed.
I'm sorry.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
I'm not famous,
so don't worry about it.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
He's a moron. Ignore him.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
It's all good! No harm, no foul.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
We're all pretty pumped to play
against your team. C'mon, kiddo.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.570 position:50% align:center
Wait. I brought some
nice stationery with me!

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
Y-You gotta sign it later!

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO] Listen,
we can't lose this match,

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
so don't underestimate
our opponents.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
Their lineup and staff
have changed.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
They're not the same team
they were last year.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
We're going to play
defensively at first.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
Don't let them throw off
our pace. Got it?

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Sir!

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
Who are we?!

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Doushisha!

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
Nice, the guys are
looking good out there.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Real good.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
Ya know it's also
beginning to look like

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
there's no hope for a certain
pony-tailed doofus

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
to get off the bench.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Watching him play's
got me wondering...

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
Has Seiichirou ever missed
a single conversion goal?

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
I've never seen him
fail to score a kick.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
When he goes for a point,
he really goes for it, ya know?

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
It took him till about
his second year

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
in high school to
get to that level.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
And the more he practiced,

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
the more scoring
opportunities went his way.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
That's Sei for ya!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
He's the best at keeping his
cool out there on the pitch.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
He doesn't get nervous?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
No way. With his ability,
point conversion's easy.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
But his true skill
is his mentality.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
That dude never
cracks under pressure.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
Amazing. He's almost
like a machine.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
Yep. And a best friend
to be proud of!

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
Let's go!

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Why's he's running from there?

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
He juked me!

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Nice try!

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI grunts]

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. I guess they got me!

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
Huh? His footwork's fantastic!

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
Yasunari looks pretty shaken.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
Shit!

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI gasps]

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
Uh? Hey!

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.445 position:50% align:center

[RYUUSEI]
Heh, yeah!

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
What just happened?

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
It's okay.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
It's not him.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
Natsu... I don't think
that kid's just some fanboy.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Everything from the way
he runs to his foot work--

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
those were all my moves.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
Tsuru. You're good.

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
You have what it takes
to win this game.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Leave him be, Natsu.

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
How stupid do you think I am?
I'm not going anywhere near him.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuu. Would you mind
icing Yasunari down?

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center

[YUU gasps]

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
All right Ibuki. We should
start getting you taped up.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
Nice technique. You're
really good at this stuff.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
It can get tricky
bandaging someone else.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
Well, I've been doing it
ever since high school.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
At first I started taping Sei
because he couldn't figure it

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
out himself. And then of
course, this manbaby

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
wanted me to wrap him up, too.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
Seriously, does
everything you say

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.504 position:50% align:center
'bout me have to end
with name calling?

00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
Come on. All I did was point
out how spoiled you are.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
[YUU laughs]

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
I've gotten used to
the way he tapes me.

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
Now I can't play a decent game
without him workin' his magic.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
It does mean I have to
put up with all his crap,

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
but I'd say it's
definitely worth it.

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
I suppose you could even say

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
good wrapping helps you
wrap up a good game!

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.607 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Whoa. Catchy.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
There! And done.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Huh?

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Yep, good to go. I'm off.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
That triangle you taped on?
Tell me, what was that part for?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
Oh! Good eye! It's a charm.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
For good luck and to protect
him from any injuries.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
It's a silly tradition of ours.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Ohh...

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] This one time,
he went into a tough match

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
with this random piece of
tape that got stuck there.

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
He got taken down by
a really high tackle,

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
but he wasn't hurt at all.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
Ibuki's convinced that's the
reason he turned out okay.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
It was the protection of the
charm, or something like that.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
I see. That's kinda weird.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
Nah. That's pretty normal logic
for someone like Ibuki.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
What can I say?
Superstars are superstitious.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
You hog the ball.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
All you do is grab it
and run without thinking.

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
I'm hustling faster
than you slowpokes

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
could ever hope to move in
your wildest dreams, bro.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
That's why I've got your
back out there, dude.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
Huh. What's that
supposed to mean?

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
You wanted help, right?

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
Well, I figured out
what your blind spot

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
is during the first half.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
You might be dead weight
on the field right now,

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
but I'm about to make you
look way better out there.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN]
Uhh...?

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
Do you trust me?

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN]
Damn, not again!

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN grunts]

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
I've finally found her.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
That was sick!

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna switch teams
and come play with me, brother.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
You're what the Japanese
call a Yamato Nadeshiko!

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
A what? Are you trying to tell
me that I'm your ideal woman?

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
Guess I sort of am.

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
You're strong and loyal
and you've got chops!

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
I want you to back
me up for life!

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
Heh. Whatever you say, dude.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
I'll help you out as
much as I can manage.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
But you'll have to
join my team, okay?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
You gotta be all in.
Because if you don't have

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
what it takes to
keep up with me,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
then you'll never catch your
Yamato Nadeshiko, darling.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
What the-- Huh?

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
Way to go, partner.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
Now that we've got you
back in the mix,

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
I can finally unleash
the beast again!

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Bro, will you marry me?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
Baby, I thought
you'd never ask.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] I was totally open.
Why didn't Ueoka pass it to me?

00:18:56.344 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
I gotta fix this. I need
him to trust me again!

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN]
Over here!

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
No crap, you're loud as hell!

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN yelling]

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
[ISUI E]
Not good. He's unstoppable!

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
No!

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN grunts]

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
Not so quick anymore, huh?

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
Dude, what happened?

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
You had me second guessing
myself for a moment.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
Run a bit faster next time!

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
Either way, I made it, didn't I?

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
You're totally bringing down the
energy of the match, slowpoke!

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
Ibuki!

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
And you need to take
things down a notch!

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
So cool. I'm starting to think
there's nothing Ibuki can't do.

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
Tch. He's starting to get cocky.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's okay to be confident
every once in a while,

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
don't you think? Plus,
if we score the next conversion,

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
we'll be tied,
so let him have this!

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I didn't mean to
rain on your parade.

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
[sighs] What a relief.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
It looked like the wind
almost blew it away.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
That's weird.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
Usually Sei can adjust
for that easily.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
This is the turning point!
Let's make it count!

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.807 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Sir!

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] Shit, I'm running out
of time. I need to do something.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
If I don't, then it's
game over for me!

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
No more prancing around--
you're going down!

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI grunts]

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
[REFEREE A]
Captain.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
That tackle was a foul.
Yellow card. Understood?

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO]
Tsuru.

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Of all the times to
lose a player from the field.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
That number 14 is the real deal.

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.817 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
[REFEREE A]
No side.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI]
We did it!

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
[RYUUSEI laughs]

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Yasunari here.

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:45.925 position:50% align:center
Next up, "Regression
is also evolution."

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
Stay tuned.
