00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] So, what now?
Should we go to the hospital?

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
No. There's nothing more
they can do for him there.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
He just has to
wait out the pain.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center
You don't think you'll
need an IV, do you?

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
Nah. I'll be fine.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Let's ice you down.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Does your right leg feel numb?

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
Hey, you. Get to class.
You're late.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
Uh. You sure?

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.888 position:50% align:center
I'll be okay. I took some meds,
so I'll feel better soon enough.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
I'm used to this.
Don't you worry about me.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
And if you could take some
notes for me, that'd be great.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna get held
back again this year.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
I'm stopping by my room
to grab more towels.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Yasunari.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:14.407 position:50% align:center
By the way,
you're gonna be fine.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.159 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling that
you're gonna be keeping

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
your spot in the
starting lineup.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
He won't be able to move
for the rest of the day.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.509 position:50% align:center
This is all my fault. The two
of us were training too hard.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.012 position:50% align:center
I tackled him.
Like a bunch of times.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center
Maybe it was too much.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
None of that's on you.
Don't blame yourself.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.519 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.314 position:50% align:center
He loves the game. He'd play
it again in a heartbeat.

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:49.943 position:50% align:center
And thanks to you, he got
a chance to have some fun.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.278 position:50% align:center
It's not as if you
forced his hand.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:56.408 position:50% align:center
Practicing with you
was his idea, right?

00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:00.286 position:50% align:center
You see, it's something
he did to himself.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
I couldn't be there for him.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
It's not a fever, dumbass.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
You gremlin! Jeez man, you
almost gave me a heart attack.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
You're the one who woke me.
What time is it now?

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
It's around noon.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
I brought you some
rice porridge to eat.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
Can't just be
taking painkillers.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:02.909 position:50% align:center
Baby.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
Come again?

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
That sad puppy dog
face you've got on.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
You make it look like you're
the one who's injured.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
Oh, so I'm not allowed to be
worried about my friend now?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Not if you're
gonna look like that.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Well, you seem to be
doing just fine. Lemme help.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
How's he doing?
Yasunari, I mean.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Who knows? Tea?

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, the team.
They're gonna make a big fuss

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
when they hear
about this. Hooray.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're their
manager, after all.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
It's pointless.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
I mean, this is gonna
keep happening.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
--Natsusa--
--[NATSUSA] Shut up.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Shut up?

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
You were just about to launch
into some stupid cookie-cutter

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
greeting card speech to try
and cheer me up or something,

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
weren't you? "Wow! Thanks,
man. I feel way better now."

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
Was that about the response
you were looking for?

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
What are you, a five year old?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
You wanna gold star
while we're at it?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
No. I mean, you didn't
even let me finish.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
If you wanna
cheer me up so bad,

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
then keep your mouth shut,
and remember

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
that promise you made me, okay?

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
I read you loud
and clear. Here.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
I hope Yuzuki's feeling better.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
He's hanging in there.
Ibuki's looking after him.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I understand you've been
having issues with your kicking.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
How is that coming?

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
I've gotten worse.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
108. That's the number
of earthly desires

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
we humans possess.
It's an old religious concept

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
explaining why we
make ourselves suffer.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
The pain you're going
through right now--

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
it's connected to an impulse.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should
start thinking about

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:55.855 position:50% align:center
the source of this conflict.
Figure out what's eating you.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
Feel me?

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
No. Not in the least.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
I never understand
what you guys are saying.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
That's fine. Why don't
we leave it there?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
Right, let's eat.
Thanks for this food.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Thanks for this food.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
Finally. I thought they would
start eating when we did

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
but instead they sat there
staring at each other for half

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
an hour like they were on some
kinda creepy hunger strike.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it's a new
training exercise?

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I doubt Gandhi
would approve.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
[TORANOSHIN]
The second-year club members

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
are a bunch of weirdos, huh?

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
[SOUSUKE] Natsusa and Konoe
can be a handful.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
But those three over there are
the ones to watch out for.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
Poor Natsusa. He hurt his neck.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
Guess we're down
a manager today.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Really?

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
If you tweak a hernia, you're
down for a while. It's no joke.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
Should probably mosey
on over there for a visit.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
Do you guys wanna come along?

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
[ATOMU]
Count us in!

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Let's see. What's next?

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] You okay? I can
help you out if you want.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to
trouble yourself! I can manage!

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
H-Hey. Scuse me, Yuu?

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
Uh. Have you seen my

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
Little Miss Moka water
bottle hiding anywhere?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh! If you give me a
minute, I'll look for it!

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Yuuki. You know he's got
a lot on his plate right now.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
You can look after your
own stuff, can't you?

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
Yeah. I would.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
But Yuzuki always takes
care of those things

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
for me, so I don't know
where to find it.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
And I don't think I can play
well without my lucky bottle.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Here we are!
This is yours, right?

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
Whoa, thank you!

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Wait. Shinya? You're done
with your stretches already?

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
I thought I was supposed
to come spot you

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
while you were
getting warmed up.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
Nah. You looked slammed,
so Ren helped.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
[REN]
Yo!

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
I hope you mixed my drink, since
you know the way I like it!

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
Huh? Just give me a
second to double check.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
I'll have it ready soon!

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, let's hold off on
custom drink orders for now.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
Yuu has enough to
worry about flying solo.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
No problem, bro.
A small change of plans?

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
Nothing these beefy
traps can't handle.

[IKUTO]
How's the kid?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.657 position:50% align:center
He's still the worst.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's get a move-on!

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI, SHINYA, REN]
Yeah!

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA sighs]
Talk about bad timing, huh?

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center

What a diva.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
Congrats. Now make sure you
don't drag us down, all right?

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I got you.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
[SOUSUKE]
Don't wave it off!

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
Those group dates you
arranged were a total bust.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
So you'd better make up
for it on the pitch.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Seriously?

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
Get over it, dude. I helped you
like three freakin' times!

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
Some help! I struck out
every single night!

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
You can't just use
the same pickup line

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
on every girl you talk to!
Mix it up, man!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI]
Taisei. Wait up.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
When we go see Natsusa,

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.459 position:50% align:center
why don't we bring him one of
those instant heating pads?

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
Ya got some in your room, right?

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
You bring it to him yourself.
I'm not going there.

Why not?

Who cares? I'm not about
to pack into a dorm.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't all fit anyway.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI] Not a problem.
We can take turns.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
Taisei. You can take my spot.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
I already went and
saw him this morning.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
This way you can go. Besides,
he wanted to chat about

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
your stretch routine
for the day, so--

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI]
Save it.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
I bet you think I'm only
being a stick in the mud

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
because I don't like you.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
Well, you're not wrong.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
I can't stand your face,
so I'm going home.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
Hold on--

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand
that teamwork

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
is the most important
part of rugby?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
You do the unforgivable

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
and have the nerve
to come crawling back.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
Now you're a starting player?
Who do you think you are?

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, this again?

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI]
I'm not done!

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
This only happened 'cause
we let him walk all over us.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.933 position:50% align:center
That's why he's
so full of himself!

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
So there.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
You won't catch me trying
to play nice with this guy.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
He'll never be a teammate
again in my eyes.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
Taisei!

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI grunting]

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
What the hell is this?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
[YUUKI]
Isn't it obvious?

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
I'm putting a Miss Moka
poster above your bed

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
to wish you a speedy recovery!

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
That's nice, Koreeda.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to trample
him while you're at it.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
He's hurt enough already.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Good point.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
Or he could just,
you know, get off my bed.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
[REN] Look at you. You're
practically made of skin

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
and bones, little dude.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
Put some muscle on that frame.
It'll keep you strong!

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed that I even
have to ask this,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
but... why are you naked?

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to see my
rockin' bod in all its glory.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
To heal you through inspiration.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, inspire away. In fact,

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling inspired to sue
you for indecent expos--

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
Eh! What the hell are
you doing to my feet?

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
Traditional Thai massage.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.034 position:50% align:center
Traditional Chinese massage.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
I'm jealous you get
to enjoy this kind

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
of international service.
You're a true globetrotter, huh?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
You put that pen away.
Right now.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
[SUNAO] Oh, relax.
I'm simply writing my friend

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
a get-well message to
lift his wounded spirits.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay. Hey, get offa me.
Whoa not the face, not the face!

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[SUNAO]
This'll only take a moment.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] C'mon dude. You'd
better not draw anything nasty!

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
Relax, I'm already
finished with my artwork.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Et voila.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] This better not
be permanent ink!

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Whatcha got there?

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
Oh. Some dinner.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
I figured he must be
starving for a bite to eat.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
But I'm waiting for the room
to clear out a bit first.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
That might take a while. Just
force your way in. Right? Easy.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Besides, it's about time

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
for the first group
to say their goodbyes.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
The Kansai kids and the
third years are next on deck.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
It's really touching how much

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
everyone here
appreciates Natsusa.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
We're a big team.
But it doesn't feel like it.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
No one's ever left out when he's
around. I wish I could do that.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
What did you end up making?

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
Oh. Take a look! It's a pot of
my special stew! I added lots

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
of fish, some protein,
a bunch of medicinal herbs.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
And fish cakes!
Delicious and nutritious!

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI, IKUTO]
Yum, yum.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
[FUUGA gasping]

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
My skin feels raw.
Did ya get it?

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] Most of it.
But your head's all red now.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet. Man, this sucks.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
I dunno what that stuff was
they forced me to eat,

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
but I think my tongue's
starting to go numb.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
Why didn't anyone try to
stop him from bringing it?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. None of us had any
idea what Yuu was capable of.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
You've been wearing
that ice pack

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
for about 20 minutes, I think.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
We should swap it
with something warm.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
Hidaka brought a hot pad.
I'll go heat it up.

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Hi, Tsuru!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
You're still here?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
There was some leftover food.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
I was packing it away.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow I can use it
to make porridge rice!

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
Sounds great, man.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.
I had a rough time today.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll get better
at taping me. No big deal.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
But I'm no Natsusa.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
[YUU] That guy--
he's like a magician.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
A one-man wonder who
can do everything.

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I can barely
finish a single chore.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
Let alone juggle all of them.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
There's plenty of stuff that
you can do and he can't.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Huh?

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
You handle the budget,
manage the inventory,

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
and update our website, too.

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
You even made that app.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
If you're slow, it's 'cause
you don't cut corners.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
That's how rugby works.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
Each of us depends on
our fellow teammates,

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
and we make up for each
other's weaknesses.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
There's no other way for a
team to realize its potential.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
I bet it's the same
for managers.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
We can only do our best.
No more than that.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
Hey, why'd you start
crying all of a sudden?

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Sorry. Bad habit.
You know something?

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
When I became a manager,
I felt this relief.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
Like I finally found
my true calling.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
And then, I was a mess today.
Making trouble for everyone.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
Big help I was.
I thought I was finished.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
Tsuru, you helped me to
realize I'm where I belong.

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Yasunari.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
That's what you should call me.
Nobody uses my last name anyway.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
And, uh, I guess since
you and I are cool now...

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
Hey, what're you doing
crying out here?

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:52.160 position:50% align:center
No matter how slow the years go,
the little ones grow up so fast.

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
What is this, a holiday special?

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
So tingly.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yasunari.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
My tongue is still--
Huh, oh, you again?

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
You doin' okay?

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
Better than this afternoon.
Why the long face?

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
[sighs] So, why the red face?

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Oh, The guys thought
up some "alternative" medicines

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
to use on me.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
It sure beats people
leaving you alone.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
Did Taisei visit you today?

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen him at all.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
No kidding.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hey, Ibuki.

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
I want you to come over here and
look up at the ceiling with me.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Just do it.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
Nice view.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
You gotta press this
button for the full effect.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
[MOKA] Don't be a sourpuss.
You cheer up right meow!

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
Ya feel better yet?

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
No. I'm too distracted by

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
whatever weird smell
ya got goin' on.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
That would the
delicious cake stew

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
that Yuu made for me.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
Tasty. It kinda smells
like somebody

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
mixed moldy leftovers
with bleach.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
I didn't wanna be rude,
so I ended up eating it all.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Super gross, not gonna lie.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
Wait. Where has Sei been all day
if he's not here with you?

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Oh, good point.
I haven't seen him.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's right.

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot to bring
the cooler from the van!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Oh! I'll run 'n grab it.

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.104 position:50% align:center
No. You should just
stay here, Natsusa!

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Huh. But I'm fine!

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Nuh-uh. I'll do the heavy
lifting--just take it easy!

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
[YUU] I've got it.
You can leave it to me!

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
Wow, look at him.
Someone's fired up today.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he sure is.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
If I may, sir. I need
to go to the restroom!

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
--[SOUSUKE] Me, too!
--[ETHAN] Me, too!

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Then repeat after me!

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
I promise I will not fight!

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
I promise I will not fight!

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
I will not allow my
opponent to provoke me!

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] I will not allow my
opponent to provoke me!

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
What are those guys doing?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! When we played
against this school last year,

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
there was a big brawl.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
The fighting got so bad they
almost canceled the match.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Mm-hm.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
An unbelievably brutish
display, indeed.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI] That sure was
a huge load of bullcrap.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
You two started the whole thing!

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
You pissed off the other team,

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
and then they
decided to retaliate.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
Next thing you know,
everyone's throwing hands.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
I don't recall it
going like that, do you?

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
Not at all! It was nothing
but a bit of banter!

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
The first years are the ones who
always get picked on the most.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
Those two were
troublemakers, for sure.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
But the other freshman were more
laid back, so it balanced out.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
With the three of you, I don't
think we'll be as lucky.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
I've got two of the rowdier
hooligans under my control.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.598 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that.

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
Someone has to keep their cool,
so I'm glad it's you.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[FUUGA] Uh. Since when
am I hot-headed?

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Do you need a reminder?

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
I see Ren and Shin have
taken the initiative

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
and restrained the other problem
child. So, let's be on our best

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
behavior from this
moment forward.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
Okay. I hope you're all ready
for some good, clean fun.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
Don't let 'em get to you!

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:23.371 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
What're you looking at?

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Oh, boy.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
Back off!

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
Walk away.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
[SASA A]
Yeah, don't get too close.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
These guys just got their asses
handed to them by Isui,

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
you can practically smell
the "loser" on them.

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
Sticks and stones, dude. We both
know who's gonna win big today.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
Really? Cause I heard
your current lineup

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
is the most pathetic
group of amateurs

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
anyone's ever seen.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
Ha. That's a bit rich

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
comin' from a team that's
never beaten us before!

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
Loser!

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
Everyone, that's enough!

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Get out, or I'll report you!

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ueoka.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
I heard you stepped away
from the game for a while.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
Whatsa matter?

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
Were you shook up from crashing
that bike you got from Daddy?

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
Heh. I guess you could say so.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
You got some nerve!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
[SASA B]
What, you gonna shut me up?

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
[SOUSUKE]
You don't have the guts!

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Hey. You. Why don't
you mind your own business?

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
Who do you jerks think
you're talking to?

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
Knock it off!

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA grunts]

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
I said that's enough!

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
What the actual hell, Ibuki?

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't rolled over like
that, I would of had those guys!

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
Honestly, man.

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
Why do you go out of your
way to be so agreeable?

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
Is that how you get
so many cute girls

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
to talk to you when
you walk around campus?

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Cause the one
that came up to you

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center
while we were in the cafeteria
yesterday was exactly my type.

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
Please introduce us.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
Try to keep it in
your pants, kid.

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
Hey. It isn't our
fault that Ibuki

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
never wants to hook us up
with any hotties.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair.
All that snake cares about

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
is hogging the spotlight
when he should be sharing!

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
That isn't the point.
You two. What was that about?

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
I apologize.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
Now your turn.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
Bite me.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] You wanna maybe
try that again? Huh?

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Give me another
chance, please! Ow, ow...

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't think it,

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
but that kid really enjoys
picking a fight.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's in his DNA.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
How do you deal?

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
Well, Natsu's typically
the one who does the dealing.

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] He protected me.
Ever since we were little kids,

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
he's stood up for me
like a tiny soldier.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
Always made sure I never had
a reason to lose my head.

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
On the flip side...

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
I get 13 times the abuse
that anybody else does.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
That's an oddly
specific number.

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:59.069 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Should be
the last one. Nice.

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
[YUU gasps]

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm sorry.

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.331 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:45.300 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] It's chilly out. So,
make sure you bundle up, okay?

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
Pretty please?
