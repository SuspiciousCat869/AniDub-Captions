Yasunari.

Lemme see your hand.
I won't bite.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a thank you?

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
And after all the effort
I went through to draw it.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
I promise I'm not
messing with you.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.123 position:50% align:center
It's just a good luck charm.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
A good luck charm?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.961 position:50% align:center
Oh, good you can listen. I'm
guessing you're a bit confused

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.797 position:50% align:center
since I usually give
you a hard time, huh.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
Then consider this a one-off.
It's a tanuki!

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
I would always draw
one on my hand

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
as sort of a reminder
to be clever and sly.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.684 position:50% align:center
Back when I used to play.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
Wow, I had no idea.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
Well, that's because I kept it
to myself. Wanna know why?

[YASUNARI]
Huh...?

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
You were my big rival.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.112 position:50% align:center

discover my secret.

Back in those days, I...

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
I was afraid of you.
I was sure you'd take my spot.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Wait. Really?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
Hmph, no doubt. But all
that's in the past now!

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:29.339 position:50% align:center
You've lost your chance to
outshine me so, sucks to be you!

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I wanted to
make it up to you.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.969 position:50% align:center
So, here's my way of doing that.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:38.640 position:50% align:center
You're gonna shine out there.

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:41.935 position:50% align:center
Yep, with this guy on
your side, you can't lose.

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.271 position:50% align:center

teammates again, aren't you?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.314 position:50% align:center
Bravo Natsusa!

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center

Good thing there's
no wind today.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
We should have a fair match.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
Natsusa seems to
be doing better.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
Judging by our last
encounter, anyway.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
Something feels a bit off,
as if he's putting on a show.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
If he'd gone to school
with me and Kazutaka...

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
Well, who can say, but I
would've given that boy

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
everything he needed.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, do you two
even talk to each other?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
There must be a lot of one-sided
conversations, I'm betting?

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
I wonder if looking after him
is just too much for you.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
They don't have to talk all day,

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
'cause they're already
super close. Obviously.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
Nice of you to barge in.
When'd you get here?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
Just now. You really love
picking on Seiichirou

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
Oh, so I'm a bully now?
Watch yourself out there Ibuki,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
you'll have to
bring your A-Game.

Yeah? You and your brother
are gunning for me, huh?

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA] Hm... I don't know.
Maybe we should go easy on you.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
Nah. That's no fun. I'd much
rather watch you suffer.

I'm all right.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
Compared to when you just up and
quit the game, this was nothing.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
Huh. Did I piss
you off that badly?

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
You sure did. If Natsu hadn't
gotten to you first,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
I would have dragged
you back myself.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center

have the slightest idea you were

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
angry when you hardly ever
tell anyone how you feel?

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Ibuki. You're pretty
dense, you know that?

I've never taped you
for a match, though.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
I guess. But you did it
for me during last practice.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
And it helped, so...

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center

strapping you down right away!

you definitely improved

since the last time
I saw you play.

So Kazutaka isn't crouching
in for some reason.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
That's because he's switching
positions with their number 10.

targeting Ibuki

out of the game.

keep hitting him...

the forwards and backs

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
His tactics and individual
skills are scary enough already.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
But he also has a gift
for training new backs.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Believe it or not,
he was the one who trained me.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
And sure, Sei doesn't like
Madoka for some reason.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
But he learned some
tricks from him, too.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Him and Yasunari
weren't even in high school

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
at the same time. But even
he got some coaching

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
whenever Madoka was
back home for vacation.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
And that's not all: If he wants
them, he'll even poach athletes

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
from other clubs.
Guess he hasn't changed.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
So you see, as long
as Madoka's on a team,

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
you can be sure it'll have
the strongest backs.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.905 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
We're in a lot more trouble
than I ever imagined.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Are we completely screwed?

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Is this my fault?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI]
Kureha!

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] No way.
I have to do something!

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
[BULLY A]
You? Play rugby? Yeah, right!

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
[BULLY B] Maybe if you
put on a few pounds.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
Just play to your
strengths, okay?

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
Or else a little tweedy bird's
gonna get crushed out there.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] Like hell I'm listening
to you. I'm not backing down!

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
[REFEREE A]
Knock-on.

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
I-I'm Sorry.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
It's cool. Shake it off.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
Get the lead out!

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
[REFEREE A]
Koufuuin's ball.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
Are you hurt? Lightweight.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.899 position:50% align:center
[KAZUTAKA]
What a letdown.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI grunts]

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Watch it.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI grunting]

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[KAZUTAKA]
Move, shrimp.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI gasping]

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Shit. I suck!

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Ignore him.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
We love you, Ishigami!

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna distract them.
So you can score a try.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Fine then. I may be a shrimp...

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
Why should that mean
a damn thing?

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
I got this far because
I'm built this way.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
I can do things no one else can!

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
I'll show 'em.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
I'll show every single person
who ever doubted me.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
Starting now!

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
--[whistle blows]
--[CROWD cheers]

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI]
Eat that, suckers! Ahh!

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
Way to go!

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha, ha. Well,
who's lame now?

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
Don't get cocky.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI growling]

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, that was a nasty glare.
What on earth did you do?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
Dude, really? I just did exactly
what you told me to do.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI]
Nah, don't bother.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
But why? Wouldn't he listen to
you? I mean, you've got a good

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
track record of getting
through to him, so...

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
It's no use. When he gets like
this, you can't help him.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
Kotori won't listen
to anyone now.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
Yep, most of us number 9s
are pretty stubborn

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
and sensitive
about our height.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
We can be kinda
hard to deal with.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
It's fine if you can accept it
like I do. But a lot of people

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
who play scrum-half
want to play something else.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
Kotori was dead set
on being a number 8.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
That's why he's always
been extra aggressive.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
All that's doing is making
things harder on him.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
With that strange sense of pride
he has, not to mention the

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
amount of pressure he's putting
on himself to fill your shoes.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
He's going to be
a complete mess.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
The kid's a ticking
time bomb at this point.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
So, let him blow.
Hopefully at the match.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Huh?

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
I say, the bigger the
explosion, the better.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
Just do your thing--
aggravate the crap out of him.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
Uh, are you sure? I'm not
exactly the best at saying

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
things to people that
they don't want to hear.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're doing a bang-up
job right about now.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Hardee-har-har.
Very funny, Taku.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
Way to put your lats
into it, little bro!

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
And thanks to you, Takumi,

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
he probably hates my guts
now more than ever.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Not my problem.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
You jerk.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
I let my guard down there.
I'm sorry.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
Relax, you were supposed
to be marking Ibuki anyway.

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
So, don't you worry.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
Number 9's a newbie--
he got lucky on that play.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
But now, we get to watch
Seiichirou's conversion kick!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[KAZUTAKA]
The main event, huh?

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA]
Can't wait!

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hey, Sei!

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
I've got a great idea for you.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
I think you should
come up with a ritual!

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.056 position:50% align:center
What for?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.226 position:50% align:center
For giving yourself good luck
before a conversion kick.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
I know for sure Madoka has one:

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
He stares at the goal
with a big old grin.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
I hear a lot of pros do
something like that, too.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
So, come on, what
do you think, Sei?

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
I bet it could really
help you focus!

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Why don't you do it?

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
Why don't you smile.

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
As a ritual?

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
You want me to smile.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
Even though you're the one
who's gonna be kicking?

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
That's weird.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
No, it isn't. I like it.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case,
I'll try to give my all.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
You should practice
before the match.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
You know, this is a lot more
hassle than I thought.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
Red leather, yellow leather,
one, two, three!

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
Uh, you okay?

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
I'm doing tongue twisters
to warm up my mouth parts.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Hold on.
Do you need a mirror?

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
No, don't.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
If I see my face like this now,
I'll completely freak out.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
Except I'm already freaking out,
what the hell should I do?

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
Calm down and take
a sip of energy drink.

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
Or maybe you need some oxygen?
Don't forget to breathe!

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI] If only you two
could see yourselves.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA laughs]

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Weirdo.

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
He's just divine.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.026 position:50% align:center
What a relief.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Oh, god, all that stress
went straight to my stomach.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
Well, that's disgusting.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Again? You won't fool me twice!

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
High tackle!

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Ikuto!

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Think so.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
It's our fault--
he's still getting the hang

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
of all the rules.
Touma, apologize!

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that was my bad.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA]
Completely our fault! Really!

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
I'm very sorry about that.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
I'll let you off with a warning.
Just this once.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:13.236 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA]
Thank you, sir.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was smooth.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA]
Hm? Who me?

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.199 position:50% align:center
That snake!

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
Come on, Gakuto. You should've
called it right away.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
I have a request.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO]
Hm?

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
I wanna place kick.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
Go for it. Do your best.

We'll take it from the center.

[REFEREE A]
Place kick.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
What is he thinking trying
to kick from that distance?

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
He's gotta be joking, right?

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
Oh god, he's not joking.
There's no way he can make it!

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
He's gonna hear you, dude.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
How beautiful!

Thanks, Sei.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
He made that goal!

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
--[NATSUSA] Yuu.
--Yes?

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Code red.
Get the emergency puke bag.

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
--Huh?!
--Uh! Right!

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
My man.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
You've got your groove back!

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey guys.
What's up with Natsusa?

Madoka? Sorry about earlier.

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
I won't make any more mistakes.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, not at all.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
Keep doing you.
No need to hold back.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
Although, lower the tackle
a bit next time, okay?

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
Change that and
it'll be perfect.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
Lovely. Knock 'em dead.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
You've been wasting time
ever since middle school.

[ETHAN] If you don't quit
messing with Ibuki,

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
then you'll have to deal
with me. Come here!

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna pick
a fight with you.

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:29.956 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
Why would I waste my time
on somebody so useless.

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
No one gives a shit about you.

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Go to hell, bastard!

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.591 position:50% align:center

Calm down, Ethan!

God, you're a real
pain in my ass, Kazutaka.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
Ibuki's barely gotten any
chances to hold the ball.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.614 position:50% align:center
And that's no good. 'Cause now
they can read our offense.
