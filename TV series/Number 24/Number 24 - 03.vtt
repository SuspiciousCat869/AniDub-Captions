00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:14.180 align:middle
I thought it was time to join
back up, so here I am.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:17.934 align:middle
It's been a while,
so please go easy on me.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.354 align:middle
Welcome back, Ibuki!

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle
[IBUKI] Oh crap, oh crap.
It's a total disaster.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.034 align:middle
I knew this was gonna happen!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.997 align:middle
[IBUKI]
Why are you glaring at me?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.667 align:middle
You're the one who
came up with this plan!

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.919 align:middle
Right, let's start practice.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.465 align:middle
[TAISEI] Not so fast.
We're just letting him back in?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.425 align:middle
So does that mean we're
cool with having people

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.345 align:middle
waltz in and out of the club
whenever they please?

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.473 align:middle
Calm down. He had
legit reasons, Taisei.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.267 align:middle
I'm cool with it. Adding another
powerhouse to the team

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:02.729 align:middle
will help us win more, right?
Isn't that what we want?

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.731 align:middle
Plus, it'll make me look good.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.191 align:middle
Well he hasn't played
for months--

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.735 align:middle
I bet the only thing
he'd make us look is soft.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.653 align:middle
Yeah, no kidding.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.947 align:middle
[TAKUMI]
Knock it off, you two!

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.116 align:middle
Well, I've seen your matches.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.661 align:middle
By the looks of things, you
can't afford to turn me away.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.038 align:middle
Hey! Come on.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle
[TAISEI]
Say that again, you bastard!

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:22.999 align:middle
Drop it, will ya?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.502 align:middle
Heyo, can I make
a small suggestion

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.629 align:middle
before we all kill each other?

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.173 align:middle
Why don't we have
Ibuki join the B Team

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.591 align:middle
during our intraclub matches?

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.134 align:middle
Huh?

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.261 align:middle
[NATSUSA] If he's completely
useless, then that settles it.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.971 align:middle
He won't be a member anymore.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.932 align:middle
Why should we have to
go through that trouble?

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.434 align:middle
Wasn't Ibuki the one who
ditched us to begin with?

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.979 align:middle
[NATSUSA] Maybe so.
But it's still a good idea.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.441 align:middle
Weren't you already planning on
doing a practice match tomorrow?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle
Though, I get where
you're coming from.

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.404 align:middle
I would be worried, too.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.156 align:middle
I mean, if you found a way
to lose against a spineless,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle
washed-up traitor who's
totally out of practice,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.787 align:middle
it would be the epitome
of pathetic, huh?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.456 align:middle
No need to worry--he'll make
it up to you either way.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.668 align:middle
And on the off chance he
manages to fumble the ball?

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.504 align:middle
Then he'll have to become
our errand boy.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.047 align:middle
He'll be doing
whatever we ask him

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.049 align:middle
to until the day he graduates.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.259 align:middle
What?

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.637 align:middle
Whoa, for real?
That would be amazing!

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.889 align:middle
In addition to performing
rugby errands,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.642 align:middle
he'll attend school lectures and
collect notes on our behalf.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.269 align:middle
He'll save tables
for us at lunch,

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.521 align:middle
and using his pretty
boy powers of charm,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.398 align:middle
he can set everyone
up with the ladies.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.066 align:middle
[SOUSUKE, IBUKI]
Wait, really?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle
Finally, a girlfriend!

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.112 align:middle
He'll be your wingman
until you score!

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:35.697 align:middle
Nuh-uh. No way.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.491 align:middle
Not with that attitude and
definitely not with that face.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.619 align:middle
Ooh, I've always wanted to
watch a man commit seppuku!

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.163 align:middle
Oh, I'm sure we can
make that happen!

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.123 align:middle
How can you say that
with a straight face?

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.208 align:middle
We're talking about
a human life here!

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.712 align:middle
[NATSUSA] Well, what do
you think, Captain?

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.088 align:middle
[GROUP]
Let's do it, squad!

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.631 align:middle
[GAKUTO]
Uh?

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.193 align:middle
[TORITEN meows]

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.487 align:middle
[IBUKI]
I'm in for it now.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle
Why did I have to go
and shoot my mouth off?

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:43.575 align:middle
[meows]

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.827 align:middle
Maybe it was your pure
masculine energy

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle
bubbling to surface, filling
you with manly confidence.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.374 align:middle
Or maybe the situation
was worse than I imagined,

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.168 align:middle
so I started panicking!

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.836 align:middle
Some help you guys were.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.423 align:middle
Also, I thought you already
told them I was coming back.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle
I tried to, but unfortunately

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.762 align:middle
87 people saw the message
and, sadly, left me on read.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.514 align:middle
Why does no one care?

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.684 align:middle
[NATSUSA] Sei. You can't just
eat the fried chicken.

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:13.563 align:middle
Man. This match was such
a bad idea. I'm screwed.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.691 align:middle
If I fail, they'll never let
me play another game again.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.777 align:middle
I get that you're nervous,
but honestly,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.403 align:middle
I'll only give a damn about you

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.947 align:middle
for as long as you're
crushing it on the pitch.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.157 align:middle
So if you screw this up,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.242 align:middle
then you can kiss our
friendship goodbye.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.662 align:middle
You two-faced little monster!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:34.417 align:middle
Anything to add? Don't just
sit there, say something!

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.962 align:middle
I dunno why you're surprised.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.965 align:middle
Especially considering how
you walked out last year.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.802 align:middle
Whoa. Are you actually
pissed off at me?

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.429 align:middle
Yeah, he is. Remember
all those nice texts

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle
he sent that you ignored?
He's mad.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:50.392 align:middle
You can tell because he's gone

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.519 align:middle
from his normal quiet
to absolute silence.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.396 align:middle
Yeah, you're the
only one who'd know

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle
the difference between the two.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:06:00.235 align:middle
Anyway, I sure hope you
don't let me down out there.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.334 align:middle
Say, Natsusa. Should we be
concerned about Ueoka?

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:20.588 align:middle
Huh? No, he'll be fine. Or if he
dies, at least we can watch!

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.341 align:middle
Hey, this is no time
to be kidding around!

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.761 align:middle
If he wins, do you think the
B Team and reserve players

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.806 align:middle
are really going to accept him
as one of their own?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.268 align:middle
Eh. No need to worry there.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.022 align:middle
[YAYOI]
Hey. Ibuki?

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:37.856 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.025 align:middle
Uh, do you remember me?

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.069 align:middle
We did training camp
together a while back.

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.823 align:middle
Yo. Long time no see, Yayoi!
How you doin', man?

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.199 align:middle
Oh. Good!

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.951 align:middle
You got so much taller.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:53.163 align:middle
I mean, back then, you were
like a tiny little bean!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.582 align:middle
Hey, come on man.
I wasn't that tiny!

00:06:55.665 --> 00:07:00.128 align:middle
[laughs] Hey. Is that
Koko creeping by?

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.921 align:middle
I told you not to call me that.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.089 align:middle
[CLUB MEMBERS]
Huh?

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.592 align:middle
Kotori!

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.427 align:middle
Would you please
not call me that?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.763 align:middle
Look at you talking so polite.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.433 align:middle
I'd greatly appreciate if you
didn't use that name anymore.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle
[TORANOSHIN]
Ibuki!

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.144 align:middle
[JUNIOR CLUB MEMBER A]
Good to have you back, man.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.646 align:middle
I'm impressed.
He's really popular!

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.316 align:middle
Yep. He's been playing rugby
ever since he was

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:25.653 align:middle
in elementary school. He's made
lots of friends over the years.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.947 align:middle
Not to mention,
he's a natural charmer.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:31.576 align:middle
People flock to him.
Especially his juniors!

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.287 align:middle
He used to be a star player,
but he's still approachable.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.331 align:middle
Hence the throng of admirers.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.208 align:middle
Only reason there wasn't
a round of applause

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.417 align:middle
when he said he was coming back

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.836 align:middle
was because of how
the third years feel.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.215 align:middle
That awkward silence makes
a lot more sense now.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.633 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
Well, think about it.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.469 align:middle
He pissed everybody off pretty
bad when he first quit.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:52.555 align:middle
All the teammates from his year
still resent him for that.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.848 align:middle
I don't blame 'em.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.266 align:middle
They're mad that
he just walked off

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.519 align:middle
without talking to
them about it first.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.814 align:middle
But no worries.
They'll smooth it over.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:04.776 align:middle
Assuming he can still
cut it as a star player.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.361 align:middle
That shouldn't be too hard.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.029 align:middle
I mean, if you believe in him.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle
Otherwise you wouldn't have made
this wager to begin with.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.409 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
Eh, it's fifty/fifty.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.536 align:middle
[gasps] So there's a
chance he might suck?

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.789 align:middle
Definitely. The world
of full contact sports

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:22.335 align:middle
isn't easy to return to after
a seven-month hiatus.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.212 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
C'mon. Show me you've got

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:28.717 align:middle
what it takes to jump through
this hurdle. Please.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.471 align:middle
All right, then.
Let's see what you can do.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.856 align:middle
Yo, genius, what the hell
are you standing there for?

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.441 align:middle
Pass the ball already!

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.109 align:middle
Hey, give me a moment.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.902 align:middle
It's be so long since
I've caught anything

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.529 align:middle
that I'm getting
emotional, man.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.115 align:middle
Well, I guess that makes sense,
but how 'bout you do me a favor?

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.867 align:middle
Stop fondling the ball,
ya creep?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.286 align:middle
You wanna cuddle,
get a girlfriend.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle

this nice to me before!

Hold me... Please.

I think I'm falling for you bro!

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.215 align:middle
You're so cool and
manly on the field...

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.718 align:middle
[TORANOSHIN]
Get off! Please!

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.927 align:middle
How are you this strong?

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.012 align:middle
You've been out for months,
ya weirdo!

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.347 align:middle
[TAISEI]
Mako.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Hey, Taisei.
Taku was looking for you--

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.936 align:middle
Don't forget that you're
the stand-off on this team.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle
Not that traitor.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.277 align:middle
Clowning around after
ditching us last year--

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:33.615 align:middle
there's no place for him here.
We need to show him that.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Don't worry about it.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.703 align:middle
I got your back, same as always.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.644 align:middle
[gasps] Not good.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:06.272 align:middle
He's still getting used
to the feel of the ball.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.774 align:middle
What are you thinking?

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.484 align:middle
I'm excited.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.111 align:middle
Ha, can't wait to see him

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.071 align:middle
serving us on his
hands and knees.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.906 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.327 align:middle
Holy crap, I got a
chill all of a sudden.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.205 align:middle
[whistle blows]

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle
[NATSUSA] You're keeping up
pretty nicely out there!

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.546 align:middle
Yeah, well.
When I quit last year,

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.048 align:middle
I was skipping class
and had nothing to do.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle
Thought I'd use the time to run
and do some weight training.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.179 align:middle
I went pretty hard, actually.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:39.973 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
I can tell.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle
He wasn't this ripped when
he was still in the club.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle
He's lighter on
his feet, too. Huh.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:51.151 align:middle
He did this on his own.
Pushing himself to the max,

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle
even though he wasn't playing...

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.364 align:middle
Weird!

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.366 align:middle
I'm really sorry if I'm
starting to sound like

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.868 align:middle
a broken record to you.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.078 align:middle
But before we go any
further with this,

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.123 align:middle
are you absolutely positive that
me returning to the rugby club

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.249 align:middle
is what you want?

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle
One hundred percent.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.253 align:middle
So don't stop
giving it your all.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:13.548 align:middle
Especially since your plays
in the first half were basic.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.675 align:middle
I mean, you're still
doing a decent job

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.678 align:middle
for someone fresh off
a seven-month hiatus.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.723 align:middle
But I'm not interested in
a decent version of you.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:22.932 align:middle
Don't look at me
with that glare!

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle
I'm already doing the best I can

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle
and the extra pressure
isn't helping!

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:30.899 align:middle
[NATSUSA] Even so, you gotta
do better in the second half.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.737 align:middle
[sighs]

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.201 align:middle
At this rate, you might as well
invest in a butler uniform.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.621 align:middle
No need to tell me. I got used
to the ball in the first half,

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.539 align:middle
so I'll take care
of it in the second.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.708 align:middle
You don't have to take
care of anything, buddy.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle
Winning's cool and all,
but personally?

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle
I'd rather have you
waiting on us hand and foot.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.132 align:middle
[IBUKI]
Watch it, pal.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.469 align:middle
What made you wanna
come back all of a sudden?

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.431 align:middle
[IBUKI]
I made a promise.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:06.267 align:middle
Yeah? Go on.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle
Oh, whatever! Like I care.
Here, gimme that.

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle
Agh, gross!
Your drink's so watered down.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.069 align:middle
It's like backwash!
Who they hell made this?

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.447 align:middle
You know, it tastes weird,
but ever since I was a kid,

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:20.657 align:middle
that's how I liked it.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.368 align:middle
[NATSUSA] So cool.
You're doing great, Sei.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.203 align:middle
Now make sure you
stay hydrated, yeah?

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.206 align:middle
Okay, time to let those
suckers know who's boss!

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.126 align:middle
Hey man, didn't I just say
you don't have to try?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.752 align:middle
Dunno why you're so cocky.

He's too cool. Sick hustle.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:34.314 align:middle
He pushed right
after that tackle!

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle
His turnover was unreal.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.693 align:middle
Like he felt what was coming
before it happened.

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:42.072 align:middle
Not to mention that kick.
No hesitation!

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.575 align:middle
He knew exactly where
Yayoi was positioned!

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:49.579 align:middle
He's a genius.
The definition of a prodigy!

Oh, wow. They're starting
to turn the game around.

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:28.762 align:middle
[NATSUSA] Watching Ibuki
out there on the field--

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.181 align:middle
it's a sight to behold.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:36.478 align:middle
It's like he can see everything
from high above the action.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.022 align:middle
He may not be built
like most players.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:43.485 align:middle
He's not the biggest, the
fastest, nor the most athletic.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.403 align:middle
But he's got a mind
for the game of rugby

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.323 align:middle
like no other. It's unmatched.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.035 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
His teammates, the opposition.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.747 align:middle
He can see all 29 of them
laid out like chess pieces.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.209 align:middle
Reading every single move
before it happens.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle
Someone with that kind
of transcendent ability

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:06.341 align:middle
only comes along
once in a lifetime.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:11.429 align:middle
But that's how geniuses are.
He alone is gifted with this,

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.307 align:middle
a blessing from
the gods of rugby.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.812 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
That's Ibuki Ueoka.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.231 align:middle
And despite that,
he tried to quit.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.609 align:middle
Tsk. Which is why
I'm going to break him.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.486 align:middle

You know we're in front of you
and that we can hear you, right?

Either way, everybody saw how
unbelievable Ibuki was, right?

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.594 align:middle
Nobody can deny that.

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.806 align:middle

join the club again, huh?

The fourth years
have no objections.

We're all fine with him coming
back, if that's what he wants.

gave his approval, too.

over with the third years.

hold off on all of that.

wanted to hire me,

How's he been holding up lately?

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.597 align:middle
He is the only one who hadn't
managed to line up a job yet.

Maybe we can get him to come eat
with us at the dining hall?

come along, too.

even wanna go! Screw this!

disgusting. You coming, Yuu?

00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.033 align:middle
After the accident, he felt
responsible for my injuries.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.952 align:middle
He was punishing himself
and wasn't acting rational.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:06.373 align:middle
When I heard he quit the team,
I was beyond furious.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.667 align:middle
I thought:
"What is this guy doing?

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.378 align:middle
How pathetic. He's an idiot!"

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.213 align:middle
And if that's the way I felt,

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.757 align:middle
I bet it was even worse
for you guys in the club.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.842 align:middle
Which is I'm begging you to--

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.594 align:middle
Please let me back
on the team.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:22.597 align:middle
I'm begging you. This game
is all I have left.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.182 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle
[GROUP] You're an impulsive
moron, Ibuki Ueoka.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.781 align:middle
I guess I don't mind
if he comes back.

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:41.449 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.284 align:middle
Sharing the field
with him today--

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.454 align:middle
I remembered how sharp he is.
He's got great game sense.

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.872 align:middle
He's really good at rugby,

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.666 align:middle
isn't that the only
thing that matters?

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.626 align:middle
Besides, he makes me
look cool on the pitch

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.253 align:middle
and he said he'd
show me harakiri!

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.255 align:middle
No, I don't think
I ever said that.

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.632 align:middle
Plus, he'll set us all up
on dates with hot chicks.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.467 align:middle
I think we're getting
off track here.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.344 align:middle
Hey, hold on. We can't just--

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.723 align:middle
[LI]
Of course we'll take him back.

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:08.935 align:middle
We'd be stupid to turn away
anyone with his skills.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.193 align:middle
Way to go!

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:21.197 align:middle
Welcome back to the club, bro!
Let's get our game on!

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle
We should celebrate
your return somehow.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.076 align:middle
Your treat. How 'bout barbecue?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.328 align:middle
We should start talking
about those hot dates, too!

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle
We should talk about harakiri!

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.624 align:middle
Dude, you can't just mix swords,
girls, and beef like that!

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.586 align:middle
What, are you trying to set us
up on a group ambulance ride?

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.504 align:middle
Should we go, too?

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.048 align:middle
Nah, I'm good.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle
[TAKUMI]
Taisei, wait!

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:45.513 align:middle
Well, it looks like some grudges
can't be buried so easily.

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:46.973 align:middle
By the way,

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.808 align:middle
Natsu, aren't you
supposed to move back

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:50.435 align:middle
into the dorms with us today?

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.687 align:middle
Crap, I totally
forgot about that!

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.231 align:middle
We already took care
of moving your stuff.

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.108 align:middle
What are you freaking out for?

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.069 align:middle
I'm not emotionally
prepared for any of this!

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:02.947 align:middle
Don't you know who I'm gonna be
rooming with? I'm so nervous!

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:43.673 align:middle
[IBUKI] Ah, crap! I gotta
plug the next episode.

00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:45.133 align:middle
Natsu'll get mad if I say
something stupid,

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle
so, uh, see ya next time?
