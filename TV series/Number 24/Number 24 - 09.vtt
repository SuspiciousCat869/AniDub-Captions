[IBUKI]
Come on, I said I was sorry!

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, too.
Please forgive us!

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.309 position:50% align:center
We just thought that
you and Seiichirou

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
needed some time alone.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
You sweet summer child.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
If anything, I feel bad

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
that dumb and dumber
roped you into this!

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
Hey, at least our best kicker's
got his groove back again.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
Good point, Ikuto.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
Although, I can't say the
same for the two of you.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
Where on God's green earth
did you dig up those shirts?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be tired
of looking like idiots,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
especially after our last game.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.504 position:50% align:center
My, my, the claws are really
out today, aren't they?

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Anyway...

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.389 position:50% align:center
I'm happy we came here.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
Hands off, you creep.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting you off
the hook so easy.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
You think your half-baked plan
makes you some sort of genius?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
Ha! Nice try, point break.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.653 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI groans]

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50% align:center
All right, you've had your fun.
You can roast him later!

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
There's not much time
until we go home tomorrow,

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
and we can't leave before we do

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:19.412 position:50% align:center
the one big thing
in Oita worth doing!

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
Oh man, it worked. Back at
the shrine, I prayed for

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.922 position:50% align:center
safety from Natsusa's wrath,
and I think I just lucked out.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
It's a heavenly miracle!

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.097 position:50% align:center
So you came all the way out here
to wish for something like that?

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
[YUU sighs] So, this is
Shuwa Shuwa Hot Springs!

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50% align:center
Oh! It's colder than
I was expecting.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
Duh. The temperature's lower
because the water's carbonated.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
That makes sense!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Might see something
interesting if you stick around.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm not really sure
what you mean, but okay!

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
[SOUSUKE] Whoa, Natsusa.
Your scar turned super red!

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Don't worry! Totally normal.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
It gets like this
when I take a hot bath,

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
and sometimes when I
drink a little too much.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool, huh?

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
Does it tingle whenever your
arch nemesis gets close by?

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It always seems to
go off when Ibuki is nearby.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
[SOUSUKE]
It must be tingling all the time

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
around the rugby club, huh?

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Oh, more than you
know. Surprisingly accurate.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
It's funny.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
Even though Natsusa
can't play Rugby anymore,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
you'd never tell by his smile.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Huh?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50% align:center
He made the transition from
player to manager pretty easy.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I suppose.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
How about you?

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
You've gone through quite a
few changes yourself. Right?

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.
It was hard at first.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
The others were stronger
and more talented.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
[YUU] But now, since
I've become a manager,

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
I feel way more at
home with you guys.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
I'm having so much fun!

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad I made the
choice to become a manager.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
Right on.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
Although, I do worry
about Natsusa.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
He seems chill and easygoing,
but... he's hard to read.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
Oh! Is there something
I can do to better

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
support him with the team?

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
Not really. You wanna
hear something funny?

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
When we were kids,

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
sometimes he'd be too short to
reach a toy that was up high.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
But he'd get mad if me
or Seiichirou tried to help.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
If you grabbed it, he'd say,

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
"I can get it myself!" Heh.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
He may be older, but
he's still the same kid.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
And that kid's one stubborn ass.
It's why we don't bother helping

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
him unless he asks
us to. You feel me?

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
He's a grown man who can
get his toys all by himself.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
He won't let you hear the end
of it when he needs a boost.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
So, follow his lead.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Is it me or is something
funny happening downstairs?

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Oh, wow! So cool!

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
Hey, you gotta check
this out, Yasunari.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
I'm all covered in bubbles now!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
I really don't see the big deal.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
It's incredible. I've never seen
anything like this before!

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
See, look. I can even
write my name!

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
Man, I gotta tell ya.
I'm surprised that someone

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
as skinny as you tried
to play rugby at all.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
I was kidding.
Bubbles are great!

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN]
Don't cry, little dude.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
We'll make a big beefy man
out of you before you know it!

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, stop!

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN] Hold still. It's only
gonna take a second!

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center
[SYOUTA] That's right!
Pick him up! Big Man!

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
[YUU laughs]
That tickles!

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN] Want muscle?
We'll give you muscle!

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Thanks, you guys.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
It's like I have
a real six-pack!

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.
Everyone's so good at drawing!

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
They fizzled away.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Oh, well.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Sucks man.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
All right, you're
up next, Yasunari!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center
I know. I'll draw him wings
like a corny fantasy villain!

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ibuki.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
You see that big moth?

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI screams]

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
What's your problem?
Why're you screaming?

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
Because there's a huge
moth right over there!

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Where is it?

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
Did it fly away?

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Is it dead, am I safe?

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
False alarm, dude.
It's just a leaf.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
Ah, well. Good.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Wait, are moths even around
during this time of year?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
That's my bad. I can't see
when I take out my contacts.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
You wanna take a closer look?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
Quit joking or I'll
drown you, jerk!

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
Dude, it's just a moth
what's so scary?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
Don't pretend that my
trauma isn't your fault.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
I still remember
the day you snuck

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
one of those creepy things
into my underwear!

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
[SYOUTA]
That sounds terrible.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop whining.
I thought it was a butterfly.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
I don't care, you shouldn't put
bugs in other people's boxers!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Hey. Don't you
wanna go join them?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
I'd rather sit here in peace

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
till it gets less
noisy out there.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO chuckles]
Yeah. Me, too.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for being
such a stick in the mud.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hm? How so?

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.176 position:50% align:center
Never mind.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
You always enjoyed
getting hot and steamy.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
I still remember the first time
you and I got in the sauna.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
We were just rookies!

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
Young, dumb, and full of energy!

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
We almost got into a full-on
fight, do you remember that?

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
Hey, you were the one
who started it, you know.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
Please, I only got upset
because you were

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
strutting around like
you were in charge.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
Well, I was doing the work.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
Of course, you were.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
For as long as I've known you,
you've been the dominant type.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
I never did manage
to top you, huh?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
I was too naive, didn't
know who I was dealing with.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
Listen. After we graduate,
I hope you aren't quitting.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Sorry to disappoint.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] You wanna guess why
I chose to give up going pro?

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
Cause you spoiled me.
Thanks to you, I've played under

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
the best captain I could
ask for. I'm set for life.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
I'm not ever gonna find
a better leader than you.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
Not even if I made it to
the professional leagues,

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
plus I don't hold a candle
to most other athletes.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
Mm-mm. Nope.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
Ikuto, that's--

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
True. I'd say I'm pretty
good at sizing people up.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
And obviously that
includes myself.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
You're heading to bigger places.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
There's not enough room
here for you to grow.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
It's getting hard for
a softy like me

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
to keep up with you anymore.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
That's why I trust you.

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
There's no way you'll let us
lose in the Kansai League.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
Because you're exactly
the kind of man

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
who can take this team
to the nationals.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Uh-huh. You need to
keep your eyes on the prize.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
So, don't get stress
about me or anything else.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
In the end, the only thing
that matters is the game.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
You got that?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
That reminds me.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to remember when
we first got here there were

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
those little rugby keychains
on sale in the gift shop?

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
They're just like the
ones Natsusa has!

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.332 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Let's buy them
for everyone! They're fun,

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't mind
having one myself.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
And just what are you up to?

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
Hey. You were about to
text her, weren't you?

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
That psycho woman with
the victim complex.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center
That's a harsh way to talk
about someone's mother.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center
Trust me, that was
the nice version.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I didn't
respond to her.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
She was the one who reached out.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
It's like she knew I was
back in town somehow.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
Ugh, small towns are the worst,

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
rumors always spread
like the plague out here.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Don't even think about it.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.377 position:50% align:center
She's bad news. We've got
enough to worry about

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
with the game coming up.
You want another distraction?

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll just stay put.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Good boy.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I am so stuffed!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
Your stomach's
like a black hole.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
No one eats as much fruit
and sushi as you do.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yeah, but stuffing your face

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
is the best part about
eating at a buffet.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
Well, I paid, least you
could do is thank me.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
Am I supposed to mimic
that cheesy thing they do

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
in commercials where the models

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
look up from their plates
in complete ecstasy

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
when it's obvious they've
barely tasted the food?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
"Ooh, so yummy.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
That's the best thing I've
ever put inside my mouth!"

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
Is that what you want?
Cause I'll do it!

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay, I don't want
to fight anymore,

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
you're right, I shouldn't
have said that, I was wrong!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
I was just double-checking.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
[yawns] Been a long time since
we've bunked with Sei, huh?

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.634 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't fall
asleep like that.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
You're gonna mess up
your neck again.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
Hey. Did you wanna take a bath?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Sure. So is
your dad out of town?

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Yeah.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
'Cause the three of us weren't
gonna fit into Natsusa's house.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
We're lucky that your place
was free for the night.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
Huh. You guys forgot
to book a room?

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
That's a bad move.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
Oh. Brain fart. Ha. Whoopsie.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
Wait. Aren't the three
of you from around here?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
Easy, we'll stay with you!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.628 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan,
right, Ibuki?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Thanks a bunch!

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Trying to
tell those guys no

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
was not gonna end well,
believe me.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Hey, ever figure out

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
what was making you
nervous on your kicks?

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
That certificate.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Huh, that thing?
It's always been there.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.195 position:50% align:center
They gave it to me
for taking first place

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
in the school marathon once.
Natsu put it up there.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Okay.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] My father...
You could say he's a workaholic.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
I never knew how it felt to have
someone care about what I did.

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
So, when I won. I was surprised
by how happy Natsu was.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
I never wanted to forget
the way I felt in that moment

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
He stopped smiling...
after that accident.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
So, when he said watching me
kick made him smile again--

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
I was terrified.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
And from that point on,
I couldn't stop thinking

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
how if I failed, he'd go
back to being miserable.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
There's no way that
would've happened.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] Right. I tried
to believe that. But...

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
Whatever I did, I couldn't
shake that feeling.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
Huh. You wanna talk about it?

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
There's something
that Sasaki told me once.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
There are 108 earthly desires.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
They're what cause
people to suffer.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
One of those is obsession.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:23.303 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, I can
feel it motivating me,

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
and sometimes I
completely shut down.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
Funny, huh?

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Heh. Makes sense to me.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Aww!

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
Hi, how do you do?
Sorry for barging in.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Here, I know it's
not much, but--

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
It's a miracle!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
Our shy Yasunari finally
brought a girlfriend over!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Yuu isn't a--

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
I never saw him bring home
a single friend in high school.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
That's because
he didn't have any!

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
Come in, don't be shy! Honestly,
if I knew you were stopping by,

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
I would've cooked
something for you!

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
You dolt. A bit more
notice next time!

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
Uh. Actually,
we already had dinner.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
Oh. Isn't that a shame.
Well, let's have tea!

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
You there. Go buy some snacks!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Is the store open?

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
It won't be for much longer.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
Hurry up, get going.
The bike is right outside!

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
It's cool. No need to trouble
yourself. Also, I'm not a girl--

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
Please to meet you, miss. I hope
you aren't put off by us yet.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
This is just how we are.
Between you and me,

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
no one's claiming my girls at
this rate. You two lovebirds

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
are the family's
only hope for survival.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
Would you guys please stop?!

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI'S MOM]
Ibuki?

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Hey, Mom.

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
I said I didn't wanna
meet with you today.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
I heard that you started
playing rugby again?

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sorry. Forgot to tell you.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
You-- You need to
stop this at once.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
It's best to focus on
your academic studies

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
and join your brother's
company straight away!

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
Mom, please.
We've been through this.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna
work for him, okay?

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
Why must you be
so inconsiderate?

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
Unless you learn to
be civil with him,

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
then I'll never be
treated with dignity!

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
Help me. I'm too powerless
to do anything!

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
I can depend on.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI grunts]

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI'S MOM gasps]

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
Sorry to butt in.
We gotta go. Come on.

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
How dare you interrupt us when
we weren't finished talking!

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
Ibuki. Wait, come back.
I'm begging you!

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Natsusa.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's enough! If you want
your son back in your life,

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
then stop screaming
like a helpless child!

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
Why do you pull this crap?

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.047 position:50% align:center
Complaining that you
can't do anything yourself,

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
all the while manipulating
your own son.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
As if it's his job
to rescue you!

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
God. You drag him down
whenever he's trying his best!

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
And that stunt you pulled
when he got into college?

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
I still can't believe
what you did.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI'S MOM cries]

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI'S MOM]
What else was I supposed to do?

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
Don't cry, Mom.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
You wanna play the victim card,
do it on your own time!

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
Leave Ibuki out of it. Frankly,
he's better off without you!

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
C'mon, man.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
Natsu.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
Hey, Seiichirou. You mind
taking him with you?

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
We're leaving now!

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'll be
just a sec. 'Kay?

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.261 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll catch up
with you. I got this.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
Hey. Let's go.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI'S MOM cries]
What a brute.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
He has no clue what
I'm going through!

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
Not one idea how
much pain I'm in!

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
You'd be surprised. I don't
think you know this, but...

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
He can't play rugby anymore,
ever since that wreck.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
It's okay. He's our
club manager now.

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Natsu's great. Against all odds,

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
he runs after what he
wants and doesn't stop.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
He keeps going until
he achieves his goals.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
No matter what it takes.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
We have to change. There are
so many bad habits to drop.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
No more just giving up.
Or being too needy.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
Aren't you tired of
believing that you

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
can't pave your own
way in this life?

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's why you
depend on me so much.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] I need space.
There's things I want.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
Things I can't lose.
Things I need to fix.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
I went off to college with
all these feelings in mind.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
But somehow, I lost my way.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
I'm going to dust myself
off and try again.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think
you're gonna do, Mom?

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
You might fall.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
But you might learn
a thing or two,

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
if you choose to
get right back up.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
I'm back!

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
So, you talked to her. You liar.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
What was I supposed to do?
She came to me.

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
No more stupid excuses!

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] It's over. I'm done
being sad, or sorry. We cool?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
Thanks, man.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.919 position:50% align:center
I'll believe it when
I see it, you dumbass.

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
Whatevs.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You okay?

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
Perfectly fine.

00:18:58.388 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should stop.

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI growls] No! I still
haven't got any step work in!

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
Taku trusted us to practice
while he's gone.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
I am not gonna disappoint him.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
We can't afford
to lose this match.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
Let's run our
offensive sets again!

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
But I--

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI] If you don't
wanna train, go home!

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Wait... You three are shopping?

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
We are. Taisei has his hands
full taking care of Takumi

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
while he's on bed rest.
Li volunteered to finish

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
some errands, so we came
along to show him the way.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
Going shopping.

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
Yes. Are you as well?

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
[SUNAO]
Uh, yeah.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
I noticed.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
Well, I better get going!

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
Hold on, aren't we headed
in the same direction.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
Unless I've misunderstood what's
going on again, of course.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
You're not confused.

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
[PONGSAKLEK] Then, why don't
the four of us walk together?

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Good idea,
come along with me!

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
It's quite unlike you
to be so friendly.

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:06.206 position:50% align:center
Listen, we're supposed to be
buddy-buddy, so play along.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
Because if Sousuke or Syouta
find out we're not getting along

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
like BFFs, they're gonna
force us to sit down

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
and apologize like a bunch of
whiney little third graders.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
Okay? You understand?

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Why do they think
that people who go

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
to the same school
automatically like each other?

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
Sure, there's Natsu
and Seiichirou,

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
or Uchinashi and Takumi,
but they're the exception.

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
Huh. There's a line
of people down below

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
sitting in a weirdly specific
way. Is there an event?

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
Uh? Nah, not really.
It's a hot spot for couples.

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
Lots of blushing and small talk.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
So, what are the rules?

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what?

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
With the way they're spaced
apart there have to be rules,

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
right? Did they draft
an agreement?

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Could be
a cultural practice.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps it's some
unconscious social agreement.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
It's like reading the room.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
Right? Oh, but I'm
not very good at that.

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
If that's true, then this
entire place should be empty.

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
They used to execute
prisoners here.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
Their severed heads
were a warning.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you for that
fascinating bit of history, Li.

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Hm? What's got you all
hot and bothered, Tsuu?

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
Heh. I caught 'em red-handed.
Say cheese, boys.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
What's wrong, Yuu?

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
It's Yayoi. He says he's
concerned about Kotori.

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Eh?

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
He keeps pushing himself
way too hard

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
and not resting up properly.

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
He stayed up all night
looking through Koufuuin videos.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
Didn't get any sleep.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.225 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. He's about to play

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
his first starting match
against Koufuuin.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
The pressure must
be getting to him.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:59.778 position:50% align:center
I'll talk it over with
Taku and-- Uh? Madoka?

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.049 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO]
Hey, Gakuto here. Uh...

00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
Let's see, uh,
my favorite food is--
