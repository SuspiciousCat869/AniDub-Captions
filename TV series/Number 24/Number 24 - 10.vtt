00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.593 align:middle
[YUUKI]
Man, I'm beat.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.178 align:middle
[ATOMU]
Why are you tired?

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.222 align:middle
You're the one who dragged
us along to go shopping!

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.974 align:middle
Hey, you went to Troer, too,

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.852 align:middle
so don't pretend I'm the
only one who bought stuff.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:23.106 align:middle
Besides, you guys barely helped.
Except for Fuuga here.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.524 align:middle
Thanks to you,
we were able to grab

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.609 align:middle
every single item
from the Miss Moka

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.361 align:middle
limited edition merch drop!

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.363 align:middle
It's no big deal--
glad I could help.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.699 align:middle
You really know how to
be a team player, man.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:36.786 align:middle
Yeah Fuuga, you're one strong
dude. But not as jacked as me!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.334 align:middle
Am I? I don't know. It feels
like I'm always holding back

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.002 align:middle
the rest of the team.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:48.006 align:middle
I'm so sorry. I lost it
during that last match.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.176 align:middle
I couldn't stop making fouls.
What a mess...

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:55.096 align:middle
Honestly, I think I'm
the reason that we lost.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.933 align:middle
This year, a lot of you guys
are gonna be graduating.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:04.189 align:middle
If we lose the next match, you
won't get to go to nationals.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.692 align:middle
You're way too hard on yourself.
It wasn't your fault, Fuuga.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.402 align:middle
Yeah, Shinya's right, man.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.154 align:middle
Nobody blames you
for what happened.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.907 align:middle
Yeah, dude. Rugby's
a team sport, okay?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.576 align:middle
You can't beat yourself up when
you're not the only player.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.994 align:middle
What the hell?!

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.663 align:middle
Why're you scrubs moping around
like everything's over?

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.041 align:middle
This is the best part
of the entire game!

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.668 align:middle
Time to dust ourselves off--

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.961 align:middle
who needs those
negative vibes, anyway?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.756 align:middle
So, let's support each other,
defeat our opponents,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle
and bring that trophy back home!

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.928 align:middle
Ain't that why everyone plays
rugby in the first place?

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.681 align:middle
[laughs] The man has a point.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.601 align:middle
It's the calm before the storm,
and victory's past the horizon!

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:45.021 align:middle
The odds are stacked. But once
we finally beat Koufuuin,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.232 align:middle
it'll be all the more awesome!

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:50.443 align:middle
We're going to make history.
And we'll do it together.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:54.072 align:middle
I'm getting so pumped up just
imagining how epic that'll be!

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.574 align:middle
[FUUGA]
Me, too. Now I'm fired up!

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.535 align:middle
Next time, we'll definitely win.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.329 align:middle
Thanks for the awesome
pep talk, Ren!

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.164 align:middle
Ren can be pretty intense.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.708 align:middle
But that speech
was actually sick.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.293 align:middle
No kidding. You can't deny
that he's got spirit,

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.962 align:middle
even when you wanna punch him.

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:12.382 align:middle
Heck yeah. I owe everything
to my beefy bod.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.884 align:middle
Okay, what does that
have to do with anything?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.261 align:middle
Can you believe
that he's planning

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.637 align:middle
on going pro after college?

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.556 align:middle
It honestly worries me,
ya know?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.643 align:middle
I just hope someone sees past
that meathead exterior of his.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:27.022 align:middle
By the way, Ikuto asked
about going to Thailand

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.064 align:middle
for our class trip.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle
That sounds incredible.
I'm jealous!

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.278 align:middle
I should try to bulk up more
before we fly back home!

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.281 align:middle
And why exactly would you
wanna do a thing like that?

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.992 align:middle
You gotta stay swole
while you're on vacation!

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.661 align:middle
C'mon my dude,
you know how we roll!

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.956 align:middle
It's like you're speaking
another language, I swear.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.626 align:middle
Well, you guys enjoy yourselves.
I'm not really a "beach guy."

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.795 align:middle
So, I'll probably
just stay home.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.173 align:middle
C'mon hang with us--
it'll be fun.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle
Yeah, man! Pretty soon we'll
have jobs, in Kansai no less.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle
Won't get to see the whole
group as much anymore.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.975 align:middle
That's no big deal. I can
come visit you from Kanto.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.727 align:middle
C'mon my dude,
you know how we roll!

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.479 align:middle
Stop trying to make
that a catchphrase.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle
I don't know, bro.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.607 align:middle
With all the training you'll be
doing for your pro career,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.361 align:middle
you won't really have time
to hang out with us.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.945 align:middle
Same for you, Shinya.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.822 align:middle
We're gonna have days off.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.367 align:middle
Uh-huh. Plus,
tournaments in Kansai.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.452 align:middle
And we'll hook you up
with tickets, obviously.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.245 align:middle
C'mon my dude,
you know how we roll!

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.206 align:middle
Do you want me to kick your ass?

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.501 align:middle
Okay, I should probably
get going now.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.503 align:middle
You gonna go visit
Takumi, right?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.506 align:middle
[FUUGA] Yeah. Me and some
of the other first years.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle
Hey, how's Kureha? He must
be under a ton of pressure

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.968 align:middle
now that he's taking
Hidaka's position

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle
as scrum-half on
the starting lineup.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.891 align:middle
[grunts] Nah. He's handling it.
No need to worry.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.852 align:middle
We younger guys have got
his back, trust me on that!

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.271 align:middle
The rest of the team can make
their plays without a hitch!

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:54.401 align:middle
Heh. Sweet. Then we'll
just leave it to you!

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.027 align:middle
[GROUP]
We're screwed.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.206 align:middle
[MADOKA]
Natsusa? Why are you here?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.665 align:middle
I could ask you the same!

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.586 align:middle
We just attended a memorial
service. Right, Kazutaka?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.421 align:middle
Yeah.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.344 align:middle
[volume increases]

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.096 align:middle
[yelps]

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.014 align:middle
Carefree as ever, I see.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:51.226 align:middle
[IBUKI]
Huh? Where did you come from?

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.186 align:middle
Ah, my ears. Oww.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.105 align:middle
Can you keep it down, Ibuki?

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.773 align:middle
[gasps] Oh, no!

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.192 align:middle
Don't look! Go back
to sleep, Ethan!

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.238 align:middle
[ETHAN] Hey, look who's here!
It's that creepy stalker.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.739 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.242 align:middle
Cool it you two. We don't
wanna start anything, all right?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.744 align:middle
Tell him that.
He's the one starting shit.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.621 align:middle
Oh, that's rich coming
from you, buddy.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.498 align:middle
[IBUKI] Would you cut it out?
You are stealing what little

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.875 align:middle
sleep I can get hanging
around you idiots all day!

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle
Agh! This is torture!

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle
You! That side of the train.
You! The other side.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.381 align:middle
Please just let me rest!

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.635 align:middle
[MADOKA] Ah! Looks like the
young guys are here, too!

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle
[YUU grunts]

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.972 align:middle
Seiichirou,
I hope you recovered.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:32.434 align:middle
You were a mess
last time I saw you.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.935 align:middle
I'm over it now.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.563 align:middle
Really? Good to hear it.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.565 align:middle
Odd that we've
never shared the pitch.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.608 align:middle
Haven't our teams played before?

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle
Oh, right, you've always
been a benchwarmer.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.032 align:middle
Leave Sei alone, you big bully!

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.159 align:middle
I'm only teasing him, silly.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.286 align:middle
Hey, stop it!

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.495 align:middle
[MADOKA]
Mm...

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.456 align:middle
You should back off.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle
Why? What did I do? I thought
he was into that kinda stuff.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle
Ha, ha, very funny!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.755 align:middle
Is that Madoka?

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:06.509 align:middle
Ikuto? And Gakuto, too!
The Toto Twins!

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.887 align:middle
[IKUTO] Well, still love
your nicknames I see?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.514 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.266 align:middle
What were you doing in Oita?

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle
Just sightseeing.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.312 align:middle
Interesting, I'd love
to hear about it.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.855 align:middle
Mind if I sit with you?

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.567 align:middle
Not at all. Let's turn the
seats around and catch up.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.112 align:middle
[MADOKA] Kazutaka?
Quit huffing and come join us!

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.032 align:middle
Go on, you heard
what the man said!

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle
So, have you decided which team

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.083 align:middle
you're gonna sign with
after you graduate?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:42.045 align:middle
Wait, didn't I tell you yet?
I'm not pursuing a pro career.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle
Huh? Eh, but why?

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.132 align:middle
You had tons of amazing teams
trying to recruit you,

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.843 align:middle
why would you turn them
all down? I don't get it!

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.179 align:middle
[MADOKA] Good question.
This might sound crazy,

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.848 align:middle
but there's actually
more to life than rugby.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle
[GAKUTO]
What'll you do for work?

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.561 align:middle
[MADOKA]
Who cares about getting a job?

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:02.232 align:middle
Nah, I'm gonna get myself
out there and see the world!

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.485 align:middle
Your big bro always was a
free spirit, huh, Kazutaka?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.487 align:middle
I already gave up on him.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:13.076 align:middle
I've heard you aren't going pro
either. Care to share why?

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.703 align:middle
You've hit a wall, haven't you?

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle
[gasps] Well, since we're both
being honest, I have.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:20.959 align:middle
I thought so!

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:24.004 align:middle
I won't deny that I'm more
talented than most players.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:27.132 align:middle
But I simply refuse to
surrender my entire life

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.634 align:middle
to the game, unlike some people.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.386 align:middle
There's no point
in being a prodigy

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.555 align:middle
if you're going to
throw in the towel.

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.766 align:middle
It's like you've been wasting
time ever since middle school.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.144 align:middle
Well, I don't see it that way.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.271 align:middle
To me, there are a
lot of life lessons

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.189 align:middle
in the game of rugby
that I can use.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle
Things like hard work
and team chemistry.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.069 align:middle
For example, every
position on the team

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.821 align:middle
plays a different role, right?

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.615 align:middle
Still, each person
supports the team.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle
And the team
supports each person.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:59.748 align:middle
It's a system that's just as
useful in the business world.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle
You're just pulling that
stuff out of your ass!

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.837 align:middle
[laughs] Perhaps you're right.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.424 align:middle
[IKUTO]
Huh. What has rugby taught me?

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.638 align:middle
[MADOKA sighs]
That was fun!

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.974 align:middle
Well, catch you
guys on the field!

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.851 align:middle
See you later!

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:28.777 align:middle
I've gotta talk to him.
Don't wait up!

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle
Hey, you.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.529 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.614 align:middle
You okay?

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:37.786 align:middle
Huh? Oh. Yeah. I think so.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.329 align:middle
[IBUKI]
Kazutaka!

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:46.086 align:middle
Let's just say what we need
to say already. Look man,

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.255 align:middle
I'm sorry I broke our promise
of joining the same team.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.132 align:middle
We both wanted play
together so badly,

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.967 align:middle
but you know how my family is.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle
What exactly was I
supposed to do?

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle
You wanna know what I think?

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.766 align:middle
You seem to really love
playing the victim.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:03.687 align:middle
[IBUKI]
Oh. Do I? You may be right.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.523 align:middle
You're totally pathetic.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.316 align:middle
Okay, then how 'bout this?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.152 align:middle
If we end up beating
you guys at nationals,

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:14.239 align:middle
then you'll have to forgive me.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.949 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:21.162 align:middle
Oh, yeah? Huh. Do you actually
think you'll win this?

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle
I do. You in?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle
You cannot be serious.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.043 align:middle
[IBUKI]
Oh, I am.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.754 align:middle
I was originally gonna write
our friendship off as a loss.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.173 align:middle
But now I'm not giving up.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.552 align:middle
I see. Looking at your
sad face usually makes me

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.805 align:middle
wanna raise my cleats and
put you out of your misery.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.266 align:middle
But now I'll make sure
to break you down so bad

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.685 align:middle
you'll wish you never
opened your stupid mouth.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.186 align:middle
Come at me, bro.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.188 align:middle
If you can walk the walk.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.441 align:middle
But if you end up
losing this game,

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.694 align:middle
you'll have to treat me to the
most expensive steak ever.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle
Fine then. What's in it
for me when you lose?

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle
Maybe you can bow down to me.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.452 align:middle
Though it won't be enough
for me to forgive you.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:04.122 align:middle
Okay. It's a bet,
let's shake on it.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.125 align:middle
[KAZUTAKA]
Get ready.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:10.253 align:middle
Oh, and I like my
steak medium rare!

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.051 align:middle
You just had to poke
the bear, didn't you?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.053 align:middle
I'm staying out of this one.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.888 align:middle
Don't act like you weren't
doing the same thing

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.514 align:middle
with Seiichirou
back on the train.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.561 align:middle
All right, real talk?
I'm actually serious

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle
about patching things up
with your brother.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.732 align:middle
And I'm serious
about getting along

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.942 align:middle
with Natsusa and Seiichirou!

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.154 align:middle
You've got a funny
way of showing it.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.991 align:middle
Guess we're both bad at showing
others how we really feel.

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle
Yeah, you got that right.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.914 align:middle
[KOTORI]
What'd you say?!

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.916 align:middle
I said that you're
wasting your time.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.126 align:middle
Stop obsessing over
tackles and footwork.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.379 align:middle
How do you know it
won't come into play?

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle
Because at no point in the game

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.132 align:middle
will you be doing any
of that stuff, Kotori.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.176 align:middle
A weak tackle like that
isn't going to budge

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:01.012 align:middle
your opponent a single inch.
And those half-assed jukes

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.098 align:middle
of yours aren't
about to fool anyone.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.516 align:middle
Besides, why would we give

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.018 align:middle
a brand-new number
9 a running play?

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:10.105 align:middle
We're fighting for nationals
here, or have you forgotten?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:14.067 align:middle
Huh?! Ya think I'd forget
something like that?

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.986 align:middle
Hey, really? That was
pretty harsh, Natsu!

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.988 align:middle
I'm just telling it
like it is, all right?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.449 align:middle
If you really wanna
take this seriously,

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.368 align:middle
you need to focus
on your passes.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.329 align:middle
Wait, you weren't hoping
to score a try, were you?

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:29.374 align:middle
Not a chance.
You're in over your head!

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.584 align:middle
Just play to your
strengths, okay?

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:36.047 align:middle
Or else little tweedy bird's
gonna get crushed out there.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:37.424 align:middle
What's gotten into you?

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:38.425 align:middle
Kotori!

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.469 align:middle
Shut up. You know
I hate my name!

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:45.015 align:middle
[YASUNARI]
Natsusa pissed you off, huh?

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.809 align:middle
Hey, watch it, we shouldn't
talk behind his back!

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.602 align:middle
[YASUNARI]
I'm not.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.397 align:middle
I bet you're angry because
he told you the truth.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.815 align:middle
[grunting]

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.859 align:middle
[YASUNARI] He told you something
you didn't wanna hear,

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:56.901 align:middle
and then some.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.403 align:middle
What's your point?

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.905 align:middle
I'm just saying I know
how it feels.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.742 align:middle
I had my own stuff, and when
he called me out on it,

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.786 align:middle
it pissed me off.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.413 align:middle
I get it.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.832 align:middle
Both of us have
things to overcome.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:15.503 align:middle
Demons we gotta face
up to. Am I right?

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:20.717 align:middle
You are, I guess.
I, uh, well...

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.803 align:middle
I know I'm small.
I can still be strong.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.889 align:middle
Strong enough to make
everyone see me.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.391 align:middle
To prove I'm not some little kid
you can just push around!

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:32.937 align:middle
Someday I'll show the world
what I'm really made of!

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle
It's official!

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:36.858 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle
Uh? What's that now?

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:41.363 align:middle
They share the same goals,
so they're officially buddies.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.614 align:middle
Best bros for life!

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.366 align:middle
Wait, that totally makes sense!

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.326 align:middle
What? No way.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.036 align:middle
Yeah, no.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.497 align:middle
Hey, since us first years
are all friends now,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.041 align:middle
we should go out to eat
and celebrate together!

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.085 align:middle
Wow. That sounds fun.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.045 align:middle
We'll finally get to
hang out as a group!

00:13:57.128 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle
You said it! It'll be nice
to chow down as bros,

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle
now that you two won't be
at each other's throats!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.721 align:middle
Better get a move on, Kotori!

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:10.934 align:middle
Way to slip up, Yuu.
Sorry, Kotori!

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.686 align:middle
Maybe let them off the hook.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.438 align:middle
It's not their fault that your
name means "little birdie."

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.733 align:middle
Nah, I get it. You can
call me whatever you like.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:22.195 align:middle
Wow, that's really nice
of you, Kotori!

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.407 align:middle
Don't even pretend like you
weren't about to say it!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.117 align:middle
[YASUNARI]
Ugh...

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:29.869 align:middle
[IKUTO]
Ta-da!

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.122 align:middle
[REN]
Oh, what've we got here?

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.625 align:middle
Cool keychains, huh. You can
pick whichever color you like!

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.586 align:middle
I'll take this one.
It has Hanshin stripes!

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.631 align:middle
That's a baseball team, not
rugby. Nothing's changed.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.092 align:middle
You always had love for
both sports, didn't ya?

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle
Let's see if there's
any designs in here

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.846 align:middle
that rock as hard as
my bulging quads!

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.849 align:middle
Hey, look. How about
this one, Makoto?

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.226 align:middle
I'm fine choosing after
everyone else goes.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:56.271 align:middle
I don't know. These're all
kinda loud for my taste.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.982 align:middle
Seriously, dude?
You were wearing a flashy shirt

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.401 align:middle
with some weird chick
on it just the other day!

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.486 align:middle
[YUUKI] That's 'cause
Miss Moka's my girl!

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.613 align:middle
That shirt is an expression
of my undying love.

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.949 align:middle
A testament to her
beauty and grace!

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.827 align:middle
I don't understand what
makes you fanboys tick.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.996 align:middle
And on that note, I've
gone ahead and booked

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.873 align:middle
some reservations for
the class trip so there's

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.791 align:middle
no backing out now, Yuuki.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.752 align:middle
Fine, I guess I'll go.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:19.961 align:middle
I can't believe all of us

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.255 align:middle
are actually taking
a vacation together.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.715 align:middle
Pretty wild.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.384 align:middle
Especially since we didn't
always get along.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.261 align:middle
I'll say. If we weren't
playing rugby,

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.347 align:middle
then we were starting
fights with each other.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.058 align:middle
I remember that.
It was super scary.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.977 align:middle
[ATOMU]
Seriously? You're one to talk.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.187 align:middle
You started pummeling me

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.689 align:middle
because I accidentally
stepped on your pin!

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.901 align:middle
That was a mega rare,
limited edition Miss Moka badge

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:45.862 align:middle
that I was trying to score for
the longest time, you monster!

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:49.074 align:middle
Y'all forgot. Ato had
the worst temper.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.117 align:middle
Only guy I ever knew
who knocked someone out

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.911 align:middle
just for saying their name.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.997 align:middle
It ain't my fault that they used
it when I told them not to.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:59.167 align:middle
You were all so violent back in
the day. If I hadn't been there

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.836 align:middle
to keep the peace, you'd all
be six feet under by now.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.673 align:middle
[ATOMU] You kidding me?
Not for nothing, but I hated

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.841 align:middle
your guts more
than anybody else.

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.176 align:middle
Don't blame you.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.096 align:middle
Ren's the biggest piece
a work on the whole team.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:14.307 align:middle
How come? Oh. I know!

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.185 align:middle
It's because you were
jealous of my abs!

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.645 align:middle
[ALL]
No, you idiot.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.313 align:middle
[laughs]

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.023 align:middle
[GAKUTO]
Can I say something?

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:23.608 align:middle
Huh?

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:27.028 align:middle
Gakuto, what is it?

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:31.408 align:middle
I wanna read you a letter.
That is, if you don't mind.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.493 align:middle
Uh. Well, who is
the letter from?

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle
This isn't criticism
about our play, is it?

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:36.996 align:middle
I'm not really sure I can handle

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.416 align:middle
that kind of public
humiliation right now!

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.377 align:middle
Don't worry. It's got nothing
to do with any of that.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.212 align:middle
This ought to be interesting.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:47.132 align:middle
He sure is good at
keeping us on our toes.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:49.175 align:middle
Yeah, we'd better listen.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.221 align:middle
To my fellow
fourth-year athletes:

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.224 align:middle
I've always left Ikuto in
charge of team briefings.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.227 align:middle
But today I will
break my silence.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.604 align:middle
I decided to write this letter
because I thought it would

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:05.775 align:middle
help express my feelings
about the Kansai League.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.652 align:middle
When we were in Oita, Ikuto said

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.113 align:middle
I was the best captain
he's ever had.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.532 align:middle
However, I don't
believe that is true.

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.951 align:middle
I'm quite certain I'm
actually the worst.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.037 align:middle
That's just not true!

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.539 align:middle
Since I'm a simple man
of few words,

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:22.042 align:middle
and have a lack of intuition,

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.628 align:middle
I have failed to unify the
first- and third-year players.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.797 align:middle
And as a result of
my incompetence,

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:32.052 align:middle
our talented team is now in
danger of being eliminated.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:36.848 align:middle
This situation is my fault,
and for that I have failed.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:40.143 align:middle
Despite all of this,
I've kept this position

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.313 align:middle
because every one of you
has stayed by my side.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:46.941 align:middle
I know times have been
challenging. And in the end,

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:50.445 align:middle
only four of us have remained
in the starting lineup.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.238 align:middle
I know that you're frustrated.

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:55.867 align:middle
Weary and unsure of
what our future holds.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.286 align:middle
Even so, you're still here.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.997 align:middle
And you still allow me
to be your leader.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.792 align:middle
Thank you so much for having me.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:07.629 align:middle
[YUUKI]
Hey, that's enough.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.382 align:middle
It's not like this'll be
our last match.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:13.259 align:middle
And that's why I need
us to win this.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:17.097 align:middle
If we lose now, then I'll have
failed all of you completely.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.557 align:middle
You've held me up for
as long as I can remember,

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.018 align:middle
so I won't let any of you down.

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.978 align:middle
Let's do this. Yeah?

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.356 align:middle
You're so freaking cool, Gakuto!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.857 align:middle
If you're there, it's a wrap!

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.192 align:middle
That's right.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.653 align:middle
I've thought of you as my
captain from day one.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.155 align:middle
Especially once I saw
your massive pecs!

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.658 align:middle
Nice try idiot, you told me
you wanted to be captain

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.076 align:middle
from the very beginning!

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.744 align:middle
But you said the same thing.

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:42.539 align:middle
Look who's talking.
Didn't you try to stage a coup

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.208 align:middle
so you could put Little Miss
Moka on our rugby kits?

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.877 align:middle
Why not? It's the same
color palette.

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.796 align:middle
Let's do it for our teammates.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.881 align:middle
There's still time before
the next match!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.634 align:middle
Maybe it would be better for
everyone else if we don't.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.011 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Hear, hear.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.929 align:middle
[GAKUTO]
Ikuto.

00:18:58.013 --> 00:18:59.764 align:middle
You all right?

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.349 align:middle
I'm fine.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.189 align:middle
[IBUKI] Hey, isn't that my
replica jersey you're wearing?

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:10.525 align:middle
It's mine now.
It looks better on me.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.569 align:middle
But I'll lend it to you
every once in a while.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.322 align:middle
I see. Too bad, it was
my favorite one, you know?

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.574 align:middle
Right, Mikan?

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.159 align:middle
[hisses]

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:23.538 align:middle
That cat has a bad personality.
You shouldn't spoil him so much.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:26.541 align:middle
Maybe you clash 'cause you
have too much in common.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.793 align:middle
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.671 align:middle
[IBUKI] Hey, Seiichirou's
hogging the fried chicken again!

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.174 align:middle
[NATSUSA] What--? Sei,
we've talked about this.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.717 align:middle
Leave some for us!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.596 align:middle
I remember how Kazutaka used to
love Natsusa's tempura, too.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.639 align:middle
Hey, why'd the two of
you stop being friends?

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:44.684 align:middle
Seems like you guys had a
falling out or something?

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:48.396 align:middle
You were practically joined
at the hip back in high school.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.149 align:middle
Uh, sorry about that.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.568 align:middle
I wasn't trying to get
all in your business.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.529 align:middle
No, no, I'll tell you
the whole story.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle
Once there was a
spineless god named Ibuki

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.034 align:middle
whose fake tragic
heroine of a mother

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.244 align:middle
made a selfish pact
with the Ueoka family

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.372 align:middle
that resulted in a
bountiful miracle.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.664 align:middle
Which as a result caused him to

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.166 align:middle
break a promise
to his best friend.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.417 align:middle
The end.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle
Uh, anyone wanna translate?

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.922 align:middle
There's some mythical
themes going on here.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.966 align:middle
But I don't understand what
this has to do with Ibuki.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.427 align:middle
It's not as complicated
as it sounds.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.179 align:middle
I was originally going
to go to Koufuuin

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.182 align:middle
and play for their rugby team
along with Kazutaka.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.725 align:middle
But that didn't happen.

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.895 align:middle
My brothers, and the
rest of my relatives,

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.064 align:middle
managed to stop me
from enrolling.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.524 align:middle
Huh...

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle
I always wondered why you
suddenly changed your plans.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.112 align:middle
It blew me away
when you told me

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.823 align:middle
you were going to Doushisha
after graduation.

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.243 align:middle
Yeah? Because I remember
you being all, "Who cares,"

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle
but it sounds like you
might've gotten excited, huh?

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.747 align:middle
Uh. Not really!

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.417 align:middle
Anyway, he won't
forgive me now,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.293 align:middle
no matter how much I grovel.

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:55.296 align:middle
And he refuses to let me
explain, of course!

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.009 align:middle
So dumb. I didn't even
have a choice back then.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:00.343 align:middle
You know what?

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle
I think I might
understand how he felt.

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle
If I were betrayed and they
didn't have the guts to face me,

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.686 align:middle
I'd be furious, too.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.814 align:middle
[IBUKI] Sure. But I never even
got the chance to talk it out!

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.315 align:middle
No, I get that.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.985 align:middle
But if Natsu did something
that horrible...

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle
Who knows what I'd do.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.321 align:middle
[MIKAN meows]

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle
I don't even wanna
imagine you going postal.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.287 align:middle
Oh, yeah! Where's Yayoi
and the other first years?

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.413 align:middle
If they're coming through,

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:29.998 align:middle
then why don't I fry
up another batch?

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:33.376 align:middle
No. That's okay. 'Cause they
won't be stopping by.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.211 align:middle
You see, Kotori is, um...

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.589 align:middle
He's with Yayoi and
Saitou right now.

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:40.133 align:middle
I think they're just busy.
I don't know.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.718 align:middle
Hey, wait a second,

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle
you're not saying Kotori's
avoiding me, are you?

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.056 align:middle
[YASUNARI]
That's exactly what he's saying.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle
Huh! Uh. I'm not sure
it's that severe.

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:51.227 align:middle
He's just occupied at
the moment. Yeah.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:54.147 align:middle
Meeting up with you is...
It's a lot.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.734 align:middle
He's kind of trying to prove
you wrong about... stuff.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:22:00.779 align:middle
So, they decided to stay
in and watch game footage.

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:03.031 align:middle
There's nothing to worry over.

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:04.991 align:middle
[NATSUSA]
Then I'll fry up more chicken.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.576 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.162 align:middle
And I'll wrap it up nice so you
can bring it over to them, okay?

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.207 align:middle
That should keep it warm
until you get home.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.292 align:middle
[gasps] Okay!

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.712 align:middle
People sure are hard
to read sometimes.

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.466 align:middle
[YUU] I heard the preview
voiceovers have been too long,

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle
so I hope I finish
before I get cut off!
