[MADOKA]
And... gotcha!

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
Uh...? Ah, Madoka.
Thanks for coming by.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
My pleasure. So, Manager.
Settling in?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Gettin' used to the job.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
Look who it is. Didn't expect--

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
Nice try, buddy.
Don't try to ambush me

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
when I can sense you
from a mile away.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
I heard that you have something
you're dyin' to say to me.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
Huh. Like what?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
Oh. You mean how
everyone calls you

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
the Forward Fury of Destruction
and it's so cringy that I

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
make fun of you
behind your back?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
You sure got balls, kid.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
Those two are getting along
the same as ever.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
Hey, doesn't Koufuuin have
a match right after this?

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But don't you have your
own problems to worry about?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
Seeing as there's no
way you can beat us.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
One more loss for you guys,
and you're dead in the water.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.568 position:50% align:center
What makes you so
sure that we won't

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
end up ripping you
guys a new one?

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50% align:center
That's cute. We've crushed you
for the last two years.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.410 position:50% align:center
Maybe. Except most of your
top players have graduated.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.746 position:50% align:center
Not to mention you're
the captain this year.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
We might have a fighting
chance after all.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center
Wow, well look at you. It seems
that my sweet little Natsusa

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
has become a cocky
little gremlin.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop!

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA] Whatevs.
Once you're eighty-sixed

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
from the league,
you can cheer us on

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50% align:center
from the stands
in Chichibunomiya.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.475 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA]
Kazutaka. Let's go!

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:43.228 position:50% align:center
This isn't over.
Better get ready.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
I'll make you regret ever trying

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center
to ditch the game
without my permission.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
What is up with those two?

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.531 position:50% align:center
Was our high school a secret
breeding ground for edgelords?

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.450 position:50% align:center
And how come I never get
to show my dark side?

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
Their lineup is no joke.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.580 position:50% align:center
Koufuuin University's team is
the strongest it's ever been.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:06.292 position:50% align:center
Chances are... they're
going to destroy us.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.753 position:50% align:center
We win the next match
no matter what.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
Or we can kiss
nationals goodbye.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO]
Tsuru.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] Damnit. What
the hell is wrong with me?

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
Pull yourself together before
next week's warmup match.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
Or else you're off
the starting lineup.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
[MALE A]
Yasunari was awful today.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
Aren't you pissed
that he fumbled, like,

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
every recovery you made, Fuuga?

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
Huh? Nah. It's cool.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
Well, what can you do?
He's taking over Natsusa's

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
old position. Poor kid's got
some pretty big shoes to fill.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
[MALE C] Hey, did you
see how their number 14

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
totally ripped off
Natsu's moves?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
[MALE A]
Yeah, he was like a clone!

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
[MALE C] Dude, Yasunari got
beasted. Not gonna lie,

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
he'd be warming the bench if
it weren't for that accident.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
[MALE A]
Heh! Yeah, for real.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
He's lucky Natsusa
can't play anymore.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
What did you just say?

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
Wait a second. Calm down!

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
He was just telling it
like it is.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
Check yourself, you poser.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI growls]

[FUUGA]
Enough!

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
Lemme go!

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Stop fighting!

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's going on?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
Natsu, help!

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI growls]

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
So what happened?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
He started it.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
It's none of your business!

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center
Actually, this is
exactly my business?

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
And I wasn't talking to you
anyway was I, jerk?

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
Kotori, will you
tell me what happened?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] It's got nothing
to do with you!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[YAYOI] Natsusa!

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Are you okay?

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
Yasunari. You dick!

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
Ikuto!

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
Oh! I guess he's fine?

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
Keep it down.
Do you want the other team

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
to hear us wailing like that?
Like a bunch of... sore los...

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
Do you guys wanna
know the secret

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
to never getting mad
at your juniors?

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
You immediately snitch
on them to your seniors!

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
You all right?

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That was intense.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
But you can't just go
'round duking it out

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
with your fellow teammates.
Especially not Fuuga.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
For the last time, you can
spare me the lecturing!

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
You think I can't tell
what's on your mind?

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
You and everybody else know
that I only have this position

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
because you got hurt!

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We do.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA chuckles]

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
Uh! What are you doin', man?

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
Y'know, it's kind of impressive
that you can get offended

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
by something you
said about yourself.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
You're still making fun of me?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
Now that would be
messed up, but no,

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna tell it
to you straight.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
Because I know exactly why

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
you've been struggling
out there lately.

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
And at this rate,
they'll drop you

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
from the starting lineup
like a hot potato.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Tch.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Oh. So they've
already warned you, eh?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
I knew it. Someone's in a pinch.
You're so screwed!

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
I... I could use your help.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
Huh? Come again.
You're mumbling.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
I need you to help me out!

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Pfft. That is not how
you ask someone for a favor.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
Why not try-- Ooh,
being more polite.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
Fine. I could really
use your guidance.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center
If you would be so kind!

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Mm, I dunno.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
I feel like you've been
acting super mean

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
and kinda scary lately.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
And you even put
your hands on me!

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center
'Member? You gave me a boo-boo.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
All right, so what do you
want me to do, man?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] You'll do everything
I tell you to do

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
for the next two weeks.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
But it's cool if you're
not down with that.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
I mean it's not like
I'd ever force you

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
to do any of this without
your full consent, obviously.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.328 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
A little louder, please?

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything!

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
Nice. First of all, I need
you to promise me something.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:43.129 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna scrap with
your teammates anymore.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
Especially not the forwards.

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
That's not fair.
The other guys started it--

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
Unless the forwards can
bring the ball to the backs,

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
there isn't anything
the backs can do, so...

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
Why would you fight the
people who support you?

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
Play nice with them.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
You promise?

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Yeah, I promise.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
Good boy.

Good morning, everyone!

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
See you at the clubhouse!

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
Everybody here saw
that happening, right?

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Can one of you confirm
that I'm not crazy?

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
No, you're not. Looks like
some old-fashioned hazing.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI grunts]

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
It's important to
refuel your muscles

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
after a hardcore workout.
Well, bottoms up!

and Yasunari run off to?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
Oh, they just left. Doing
some one-on-one training.

That's right.

Gakuto to let them do it,

under the club rules.

I checked in with
our supervisor.

We got their approval,
so it's fine.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
Great.

were gonna practice.

Oh, we are!

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
All right. You're gonna run
through this rectangle

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.029 position:50% align:center
and get from one side
of it to the other.

In other words, your job is to
get past me while I'm inside

the box. We'll pretend
that me touching you

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
counts as getting
tackled on the field

by someone from the other team.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
Smaller guys like us
have to rely on speed

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
and footwork to avoid
getting tackled.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
Which is why staying nimble
and avoiding contact

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
is our number one priority.
Makes sense?

[YASUNARI grunts]

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
So If you aren't good at
dodging, then you can't

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
carry the ball forward,
which obviously means there's

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center

to win the match.

for now, let's give it a try.

Not once you've put
your mind to it.

Instead you ignore the fact
that it's not panning out.

to cover it up.

supposed to do then,

that style only works for me.

to find what works for us.

gained, you have to let it go

[NATSUSA] Nah. I think you hit
on something important.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
He's juggling too
many new approaches,

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
and his plays are messy.
You can tell someone's lacking

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
in the self-confidence
department, huh?

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
Wait, have you been
second-guessing yourself

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
during your games recently?

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Uh. Sort of.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
But why? You're so talented.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
My obsession with rugby

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
may have started
because of Natsusa,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
but after that,
you began to inspire me, too!

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Especially with Hanazono.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
That changeover! I thought you
were so frickin' awesome!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
I could barely believe
a person my age

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
was able to do
something so advanced.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
And the most interesting
part of the--

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
Okay, I think I get the picture.

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Welp, I'll leave you guys to it.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Why don't you spend
the night here?

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
What? But...

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] I already told them
that you'll be off-campus.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
Is that all right, Yuu?

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course it is!

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
Wait...

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Okay, you two. Buh-bye!

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
[door clicks]

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI sighs]

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] You've really outdone
yourself this time, Natsusa.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
He's practicing his footsies
and swerves at the moment.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.813 position:50% align:center
Like a boot camp to
get him reacquainted

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
with his true play style.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
For every no-no, he gets a bow.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
Hey. There's your next obstacle!

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
Yasunari,
run through those guys!

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
No way. That group
looks impossible.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Oh? Lemme tie another
ribbon on you.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
I'm on it.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
He's improved quite a bit.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
That's it! You're
killing it, bro.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
Almost at the end!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
All right! Up top!

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
Flawless work, Tsuru!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
Eh? Oh, no.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Uh?

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
Didn't I say that
getting touched by me

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
earns you a no-no bow?

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
Someone's being a troll.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:55.575 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA sighs]
No more doing things.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
Did you ever get
nervous, ya know,

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
back when you started out here?

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Why would I be nervous?

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah, of course,
you were just fine.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
No, I wasn't.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
You're scared
'cause it's different

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
from high school, right?

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
You came to Doushisha
wanting to surpass me.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
But I ended up in the hospital
and you never got your shot.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
And you weren't expecting to
find so many guys who were

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
as good as I was, let alone
ones as fierce as Ibuki.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
Anyone would doubt themselves.
They might even wonder if

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
they were cut out
to survive this place.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
I bet you thought you
could cover up

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
your fears by barreling
your way through them.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
Man, I did the same exact
thing. And I hate to say it,

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
but those creepy feelings
don't disappear overnight.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
Then how do I get rid of them?

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
You don't. You accept them.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
You can either make your
emotions a friend or an enemy.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
It's really up to you.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to figure out
what's more important to you.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
Do you want to focus on the
bad stuff or the good stuff?

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
During your last few practices,
haven't you noticed

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.642 position:50% align:center
that there are things you
can do that no one else can?

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
I mean you had to
have seen it, right?

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
Sure, I guess.

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Then, don't take any
of that stuff for granted.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
Keep honing those skills--

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
till they're sharp
as an ice pick.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
And once you overcome
your insecurities,

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
you can use that pick
of yours to crack

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
the skulls of any smarty
who gets in your way. Heh.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] If I can't show them
results, then I'm finished.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
Pull yourself together before
next week's warmup match,

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
or else you're off
the starting lineup.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
Relax, you're gonna
be fine out there.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
How do you...?

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
Ah, you want a little pep talk
before you go out on the field?

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
I know, something,
something positive vibes,

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
blah-blah believe in myself.
I'm scared.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] You're making too
big a deal out of this.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
When you think about it,
you're just my replacement.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
A diet Natsusa.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
Obviously you're never
gonna be better than me.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI grunts]

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
He's such a freakin' jerk.

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
He's always pissing me off!

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. He's racing around
the pitch like a tornado!

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:21.596 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Dammit!

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
That changeover! I thought you
were so freaking awesome!

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
I could barely even
believe a person my age

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
was able to do something
so advanced.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
I did it!

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
[REFEREE A]
No side.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
[TORANOSHIN]
Good job, kid!

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.871 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Awesome, Yasunari!

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Good stuff out there.
Time to ice you down.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
You good?

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I feel like I improved
my game a little, thanks to you.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
Yeah, a little.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
We still gotta make
sure we kick off

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
the league match
next week with a bang.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Hmph.

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO]
Tsuru!

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
You're good.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
Ohh! But... Why?

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
Don't pretend I didn't see you

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
giving Yasunari a
bunch of safe passes.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on,
I was only tryna help.

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
The guy was in a
bad spot, ya know?

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
So I gave him some easy chances
to prove himself, that's all.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
You're getting soft, blondie.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Someone's gotta
look out for him.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
It's not easy being
on the receiving end

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
of your abuse, Natsusa.

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
We victims have to
stick together, y'know?

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna stab you
with an ice pick.

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.387 position:50% align:center
What are you an ice-sassin?

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hey... You awake?

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
Yasunari.

00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Yeah?

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:03.406 position:50% align:center
I need... need you to call Sei.
Can you do that for me?

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI grunts]
What happened?

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I don't think I can move.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.215 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA] Sorry you didn't see
much of us this episode.

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
Same for the next one,
but stay tuned!
