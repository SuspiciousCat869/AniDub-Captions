00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.071 position:50% align:center
Still feeling numb?

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
Yeah. A little bit.
But otherwise, I'm a-okay.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
Hand it over.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Really though, I'm doing fine!

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
I talked to your mom yesterday.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Crap. I forgot to call her back!

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.464 position:50% align:center
Guess she tried
you instead, huh?

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.341 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Sorry. Was it
about the paperwork

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.176 position:50% align:center
for repeating the school year?

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
I think the first two minutes

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.638 position:50% align:center
of the conversation
were about school stuff.

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.931 position:50% align:center
The last hour was about how

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
her favorite idol group
is breaking up.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.894 position:50% align:center
She barely talked about me?

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
Actually, she started crying.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
About her boy band, I bet.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.571 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
You need a break?

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
No. I'm all right.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since I've
walked anywhere this far is all,

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:01.413 position:50% align:center
so don't you worry about me!

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.831 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Who am I kidding?

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
I'm totally about to make
you worry. A whole lot.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
Catch you later.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
You should probably
head to your own class.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Last thing we need is you
getting held back, too.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
I'll come by and
get you after class,

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
so wait here for me.

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
You're the best, Sei!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center

of things in no time.

[FUUGA]
Is that Natsu?!

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
I was so worried.
It's great to have you back,

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
but are you sure you're okay?

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
Uh. I am.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're gonna
be first years together,

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
so hopefully you
can watch my back.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Don't hesitate
to ask me for help.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
I'm here for you, buddy!

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
Wow. That's nice of you.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
But first, you should
cool off a little.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorry 'bout that.
I ran all the way over here!

Oh. Yasunari?

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
Hey, how've you been?
Long time no see.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
Uh? Say, that reminds me.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
I saw some of this
year's league fixtures.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center

and I was wo--

Are you giving me advice?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nah, man.
Just wondering how you felt.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
Good, Because I wasn't
looking for any pointers.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
Especially not from you.

Uhh...

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait up!

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Yasunari.
Dude, slow down!

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
Was it something
I said, or what?

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center

like that back in high school.

a move-on Natsu--

while you were in the hospital?

Nuh-uh. He lost
muscle, not height.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center

in bed for half a year.

[NATSUSA] Wait, are you saying
I can't? Am I too annoying?

I know I can be a pain
in the butt sometimes,

so if you decide to
change your mind,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
then I understand. Oh...

Natsusa, wouldjya stop
guilt tripping Gakuto?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
I didn't change my mind,
I was only checking in.

I support you.

at the meeting.

The matches for the year
have already begun.

And we still don't have
enough bodies on the field.

while I'm still
learning the ropes.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
But either way I'm
gonna give it my all!

[NATSUSA] Looks like he
might be a little mad.

Wait a minute, Natsu does that
mean you're gonna help us

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
with our stretches and
act as our timekeeper,

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50% align:center
and maybe even wash
our uniforms every time

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
we practice and have
a match and stuff?

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
Uh. I suppose I'm gonna have to?

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50% align:center
[FUUGA]
No way! I can't believe it.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
That's so motivating!

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
Well, on that note, we should
end our meeting for the day.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
Everyone, make sure
to stretch out properly,

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
and cool down your
muscles with plenty of ice.

actually be pretty cool!

I knew you would've been
against it if I told you

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
from the get-go.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
A manager still has to hustle;
there's lots of heavy lifting.

I'll be careful!

physical activity.

out of the question.

no way that your body

that kind of stress.

stay in the game.

need a hand, then,

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
of course I'll be there
to lend it to you.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
[gasps, laughs]

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
Don't walk so fast.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
You starting to get hungry yet?

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
You want some home cooking
from your best buddy Natsu?

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Yeah. Toriten.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
Fried chicken. Uhh...

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
That'll kinda take a lot
of work to put together.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
You're suggested cooking
in the first place,

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50% align:center
so don't complain now.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Looks tasty!

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
[FUUGA]
Hey, Natsu!

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Over here, Seiichirou!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Sup, Fuuga.
Ya mind if we sit with you?

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
It'd be my pleasure!

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[YAYOI]
Hello. Nice to meet you!

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Yayoi Tsudura, am I right?

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
And you're Kotori Kureha.
The two of you came from

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center
Fukuoka South High School,
didn't you?

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
That's us. And I gotta say,

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
I'm flattered that you even
remembered our names!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
Right? Kotori?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center
As soon as I decided
to become a manager,

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
I got to work memorizing the
profiles of every club member.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] So when did you
guys start rugby.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
Cause I totally
remember your team.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure we played
against you a few times.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
--Kotori, aren't you a--
--[KOTORI] Hey.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
I really hate my name.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
So try not to use
it so much, okay?

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
Hey, now...

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
That was cold.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.810 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
No, it's fine. My bad.

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] I can't get a word
in with anyone today.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Fuuga's ravenous as ever.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
And you can really put it away
for someone your size, Yayoi.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
That guy over there.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
I think his file said he's
a first-year student

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center
named Yuu Mashiro?

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
He went to Raselle
High School in Kyushu.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
That's a super hard
school to get into.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm pretty impressed.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
Why is he eating alone?

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
We take a lot of the
same classes together

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
and he seems to
be a friendly guy,

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
but he always wants
to sit by himself

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
whenever it's time to eat.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Yuzuki!

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's up?

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
Would you mind bringing
over some more ice, please?

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
On it!

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
[SUZU] Ugh, Yuzuki,
the water bottles stink.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
You forgot to wash them!

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
Who washed the towels without
shaking out the sand first?

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
It's gonna kill the machine.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
My bad.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER G] Our drinks were
watered down today.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
And warm, too. Ugh.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER H]
Yeah. I'm pretty sure

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
it's Natsusa's fault.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Oops. Force of habit, I guess.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
Nothing helps a player
refuel better than hot,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
watery energy drink.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
How's he gonna be a manager
when he doesn't even know

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
how to ice a cooler?
Kind of pathetic, right?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER H] Who would go
from being a star rookie

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
in the spotlight,
to scrubbing dirty kits

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
while watching from
the sidelines?

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
It's probably way worse
to be Yasunari, though.

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
Having to fill in his shoes.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER H]
Too bad.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
I heard Natsusa can't play
anymore after the accident.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
And Ibuki's done, too.
I think it's why he quit.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER G] I joined
the club because of Ibuki.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
It sucks that he's gone.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER H]
I know what you mean.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.
Let me think it over.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Makes complete sense to me.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
I could pick you up easily.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that's
beside the point.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
I'm a manager now,
things are different.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
What's all this about?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Nothing?

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
Is it all right
with you if Natsu

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
lives in the dorms with us?

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
Wai-- C'mon!

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
I suppose that would
make it a lot easier for you

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
to perform your
managerial duties.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's not your
first time living there.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to discuss it
with Gakuto and the coach.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
Thanks for hearing us out.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
W-Wait a minute, I--!

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] I'm telling you,
there's definitely gonna be

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
guys who don't like this!

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure no one cares.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they do. You just never
notice these things, Sei.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Boys! A little help here!

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
[YUU panting]

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
Hey. You awake?

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
[YUU gasps]

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Morning.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Take it easy there, tiger.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
The crew said they saw you
pass out on the field

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
right in the middle
of running drills.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
You were probably pushing
yourself way too hard.

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
Sorry I caused a fuss.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm starting to
feel better now.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate your help.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Let's go the hospital!

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
Huh. I'm okay. No need
to trouble yourself!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
I didn't finish my run.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
I need to hurry back
to practice anyway.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
I'm already so far behind
the rest of the team.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
All right, Yuu.
Let me ask you this.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
Have you noticed how
the upperclassmen

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
are always exceptionally
nice to me?

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Huh? Come to think of it,
they do seem fond of you.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
Know why?

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
I'm about to let you in
on some secret techniques.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
There's three simple sentences
you need to start adding

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
to your rotation, okay?

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
Number one:
"Huh? Are you for real?"

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
There. Now why don't
you give it a try.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
Huh. Wait. Really?

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] No. You gotta
lean forward a bit first.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
Then, pull back. Like so...

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
And open your eyes real
wide at the very end!

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
Huh. Are you for real?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Moving on:
"You sure know your stuff!"

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
You... You sure know your stuff.

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] And finally:
"I learned a lot from you!"

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
I... I learned a lot from you.

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
Slick, huh?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
I think you've mostly
gotten the hang of it,

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
but there's still
one more phrase.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
And it's the most important one.

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
So, there's more than three?

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
If an upperclassman wants
to take you somewhere

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
you gotta respond like this:

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
Ooh. Can I come, too?
I'll go anywhere!

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
There. Now why don't
you give it a try?

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
I'm anemic. They also told me
I have a gastric ulcer.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
Caused by too much stress
and not eating the right food.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
Why did this happen to me?

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
I've always admired it--
Oita prefecture.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
The rugby team of
Maisagi High School.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
You, Shingyouji, and Ueoka were
unstoppable on the rugby pitch.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
You practically sparkled.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
I had to go see the three
of you play in Hanazono.

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
I'd never witnessed
anything like that.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
Of course, Raselle didn't
have a strong rugby team.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
So when I came
to this university,

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
I wanted to play
with you. But...

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
I'm so mediocre.
I can't even finish a drill.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
Let alone be a regular.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
And now I'm here.
How humiliating.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
You still love the game?

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
Right now, I don't really know.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
I understand.
I love it. Even now.

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
And I'm not even allowed
to play anymore.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
[YUU gasps]

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Thing is,

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
I'm very much aware that
I look pretty pathetic.

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
Clinging onto a sport that
I can't compete in--

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
I'm a walking pity party.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
But you know what
I figured out?

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
If I spend more time
caring about how

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
I look and throw away the game,

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
then I'm focusing on
my ego instead of

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
focusing on what I love.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
So I think being a guy like me,

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
someone who should
quit but just won't?

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
That's pretty cool.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Look, if you
wanna quit, that's okay.

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
I won't lie, it's a challenge
for anyone to stand out

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
on such a competitively
talented team.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
No need to force yourself
if you're over it.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
But let me ask you the
only thing that matters.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
Yuu Mashiro:
Do you love rugby?

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
[YUU] I do. I love rugby more
than anything else in the world!

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
There he is!

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
[stomach grumbles]

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
Sounds like your
appetite is back!

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
Why don't we go get you
something to eat

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
that'll be easy on your stomach.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
I know a really
great Udon place.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Huh. Right now? Um, but I--

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
I should really go back
and check in

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
with the club captain first.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA clears throat]

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh. Oh, yeah.
"Huh, are you for real?"

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
I'll go anywhere with you!

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah. Fast learner.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sei. Hi.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
How did you know
we were here?

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
Heh. You been there long?

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Yep.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
You came at the perfect time.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
Wanna chow down on
some soupy noods?

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Here's a
word of advice, Yuu.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Eat as much as you're
comfortable with,

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
and not a single bite more.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Huh?

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
When I first started training,

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
seeing how much food
all those meatheads

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
could destroy put a lot
of pressure on me.

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Natsu eats about
as much as an ant.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's a bit
of an exaggeration!

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
And don't compare me to a bug!

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Okay, a mouse, then.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
My name is Yuu Mashiro,
and I'm a first year.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
Starting today, I'll support
you as a junior manager.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
I'll give it my best shot!

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hey, Natsusa.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ikuto.
What the heck are you doing?

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
I could ask you the same thing!

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
Owie. But you told me
you needed more managers.

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
I remember that's what you said

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
when I brought it up for myself,
so I thought I'd help you out!

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
Recruiting more
operations staff is one thing,

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't mean you should
poach our players to do it!

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
If you're lookin' for more
people to help us out,

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate a hottie.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
I'm just sayin',
the blonder, the better!

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
Ethan's right, you gotta
bring us a cute girl!

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
What? But we have Yuu.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
He's one of the best timekeepers
you could ask for!

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
He's really smart.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
And couldn't we use someone who
can take charge of the budget,

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
track our schedule,
and update the website?

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
Huh. Makes sense when
you put it that way.

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Holy cow, Ethan, you sure
know your stuff, huh?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
Uhh. Well, I was gonna
bring that up, too,

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
so great minds, I guess.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Whoa. Are you for real?

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
You know what they say,

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
the best athletes deserve
the best managers.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
So knowledgeable.
I learn so much from you!

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN] Man, Natsusa just
gets people, y'know?

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] W-W-Wait, no! Wai--
Don't you see what he's doing?

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on!

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[SUZU]
Where's the Vaseline?

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Oh. I'll go find it for you!

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA sighs]
Did it grow legs or...?

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
[CATS meowing]

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI grunts]
Just five more minutes, okay?

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
--[IBUKI screaming]
--[thud]

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Fine, I'm up.

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:50.060 position:50% align:center
Damn. Who taught you to
be so vicious, Mikan?

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
Heh. Morning, Toriten.

00:21:57.776 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Ya kidding me?
Where'd you find all this junk?

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.661 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI gasps]

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:43.798 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Sorry we didn't play any rugby.

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:45.633 position:50% align:center
There's not much action
in the next one, either,

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
but stay tuned!
