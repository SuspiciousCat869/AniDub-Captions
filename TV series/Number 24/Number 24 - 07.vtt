[GROUP]
I promise I will not fight!

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. When we played
against this school last year,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
there was a big brawl.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
The fighting got so bad they
almost canceled the match.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
Walk away.

Really? Cause I heard
your current lineup is

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
the most pathetic group of
amateurs anyone's ever seen.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
Ha! That's a bit rich
coming from a team

you mind your own business?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.811 position:50% align:center
Huh? I am.

weirdo's got a bunch of files

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.276 position:50% align:center

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.612 position:50% align:center
Uh. I believe that's mine!

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.072 position:50% align:center
Not so fast!

Dude. You're crossing
the line here.

Talk about messed up.

This is totally
invading our privacy!

No. That's all public data.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
Anyone could
research your games.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.670 position:50% align:center
Everything else there
is my own analysis.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
None of it's breaking any laws.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
So?

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.676 position:50% align:center
So, I'd like it back.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
Well, all right then.

buy another tablet.

But if today's game
gets canceled,

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
everything we've worked for
will have been for nothing!

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
Just think, for the
fourth-year students,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
it's their final season!
You gotta let this go.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
Punish them on
the field instead!

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Fine then. We'll do it your way.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center

No flying solo.

I remember we played
against him last year.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
He's good at tackling.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI]
You shouldn't be on the bench.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
It's true. You deserve
a starting spot.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
You gotta let it go, man.
I know Taku thinks so, too.

Does he?

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Taisei. All you're doing
is wasting your energy.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
You gotta stay
focused out there.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
Yeah, fine.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Anyway, make sure
to key in on number 5, okay?

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center

where you were.

Sorry. Didn't mean to keep
you waiting like that!

No worries. Thanks for
doing all the heavy lifting.

on your breathing.

thanks for all things.

understand those three. One day.

Um. What should we do?

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
Do we come back later?
I don't wanna annoy them.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
It's fine. At this point,
I'm pretty much used to it.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
during that last game,

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
I noticed his balance
was all out of whack.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
I should tape up his back, too.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuu? You good?

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
Didn't you wanna take a video
of this for your notes?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
Oh! I sort of dropped
my tablet a minute ago.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
It's broken at the moment.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center
That sucks. I'm sorry man.

No, uh, I have a backup stored
on my computer, so it's cool.

Okay. Since you're not filming,

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
you can be more hands-on.

We'll start over here.
Feel that?

That's the trapezius muscle.
This drapes over the scapula

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.937 position:50% align:center
and crosses over the
latissimus dorsi, right here.

Feel where they connect?

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I actually can.

Pull tight, then relax
to half tension.

Done. That's it.

Nah, there's nothing to it.

I became a manager. Point is,

I've only been doing it properly
for a few months now.

the hang of it in no time.

Right.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
We're better than that.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
It's over. We lost.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
Yuu.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Yeah?

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:02.804 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
Sorry about what?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
We couldn't win.
Guess I lied to you.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
Please don't talk
about it like that.

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
That was an incredible match.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Hey, man.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
Who's in there now?

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
Ikuto and a few others.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
It was getting a
little bit crowded,

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
so I stepped outside.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
That so? Then we
should head out.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
We can visit him
another time, okay?

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yeah.

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Natsusa?

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
Let's go home.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Natsu.

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
Stop coming to matches.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
When you're there, I can't kick.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:10.497 position:50% align:center
If you want us to win,
stay away.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
What?

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.090 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
This is Seiichirou Shingyouji.

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:46.968 position:50% align:center
