[NATSUSA]
Are you serious?

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
You're telling me you programmed
this whole app all by yourself?

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It really wasn't that
much work, to be honest.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
Aren't you selling
yourself a bit short?

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
I mean you made it
easy to pull up

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
current league results
in an instant.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
You can even find
profiles on members

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
from the opposing team!

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
Whoa, with your coding skills,

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
you should quit being a manager
and start your own company.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
Why would you say that?

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
Don't start giving him
ideas about leaving us

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
when you know we'd be a
complete mess without him!

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
[YUU chuckles]

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
We're playing against the guys
from Hainokikan tomorrow.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
Apparently their team roster
hasn't changed too much.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
Sweet. I remember we
crushed them the last time.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
They shouldn't be
a problem for us.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
These guys, on the other hand...

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
Koufuuin University is
the reason our school

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
can never seem to
break second place

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
in the Kansai League.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
And from what I've heard,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
Hongou and his crew are as
unstoppable as ever this year.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
Wasn't he an upperclassman when
Natsusa played for Maisagi High?

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
The God of Backs, Madoka Hongou.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.327 position:50% align:center
And the Forward God of
Destruction, Kazutaka Hongou.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.079 position:50% align:center
Those brothers are a big deal.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
Yep. They were his awesome
teammates back in the day.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50% align:center
Now they're a pair of
fearsome adversaries

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.960 position:50% align:center
leading the charge
for the competition.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.380 position:50% align:center
They sure look scary.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.300 position:50% align:center
Well, we've got a long
road to victory,

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
so let's focus on
beating Hainoki first!

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.723 position:50% align:center
--Yes, sir!
--All right, sir!

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.100 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which...

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.352 position:50% align:center
I'm bummed you won't be
there with us tomorrow.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.937 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Me, too.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.564 position:50% align:center
Something came up for me
this weekend. I'm sorry.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
But I know the team
is safe in your hands.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.194 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Okay!

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
What are you scheming?

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Eh, Koufuuin
aren't the only ones with a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.415 position:50% align:center
God of Backs. I'm bringing
Ibuki Ueoka home.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
[MEN chattering]

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Wow. What a hunk!
You've got muscles everywhere.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] Hey, c'mon.
Let me feel them, too!

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable. So beefy!

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Guess I'm more
jacked than I look.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
You must play sports.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
I lift here and there.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
You gotta stay ready.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
You never know when
a girl might need

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
an arm to rest her head on.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN sigh]

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
I can't wait to try that!

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
Yeah, where can I get in line?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
Uh. Where did he come from?

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
Hey, cutie!

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
Do you know this guy?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Evening, ladies.
I'm Natsusa Yuzuki.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
No way. You're kidding me!

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Long time no see, old friend!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, you never
came to visit me.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Glad to see you didn't pass on
or get murdered or die!

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
So, you wanna have
a drink with us?

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN]
The more the merrier!

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Not a chance. Go home.
You're under-age.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm old enough
to drink as of this year.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
Exactly how long has time
stopped in your world?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
Wanna tell me why
you're in this club?

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
I'm here to get you
back into rugby.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
So come back.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
Wow. So you really did
use to be an athlete!

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
That's why you're so muscly!

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
I'm through with that game.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.960 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN]
Huh?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Okay. Why? Is it because of me?

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
The reason I quit has
nothing to do with you.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
Now get out of here.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Why don't you
play with us instead?!

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
--[WOMAN B] Yeah, c'mon cutie!
--[WOMAN C] Yay, party!

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN gasp]

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
Natsusa! Hold on!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN C]
What happened?

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
I'm right here! You all right?

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
I'm so sorry!

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Is it bad? I'll call someone!

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
No, he's gonna be fine.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
I'm just gonna take him
outside for some air.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Are you sure?

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN C] He looks hurt!
How can we help him?

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
There's nothing we can do.
I'll get him some help.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
I'll find a hospital.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
You' don't look good.
Hold on, gimme a sec.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Of course I deleted it.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
Hey, Natsusa, give me your
phone. I'll call Seiichirou.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
He won't pick up.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
He's got a match tomorrow.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't-- Uh, hey!

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA sniffs] You may have
fallen off the wagon,

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
but at least you haven't
started smoking yet.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
What the hell man?
Did you come down here

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
so you could harass me to death.
What is it you want from me?

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Like I said, I want
you to come back and play rugby.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
That's not gonna happen!

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
So that's all? "I injured my
teammate and I feel guilty,

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
so I can't play
sportsball anymore!"

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
That old clichÃ©?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
You couldn't come up
with a better excuse?

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You should rest.
I'll take you home.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
Did you leave the dorms?
Where you living at?

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm good.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
Think I'll just take
the train back on my own.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're
gonna be all right

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
walking around by yourself?

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50% align:center
Luckily I've got
a cervical hernia,

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
so I'd say the fact that I can
move my neck is a good sign,

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
considering how I can't move
at all when it really hurts.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Oh. One more thing.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm not
gonna give up so easy.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] But why not? I can't
do anything for you.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI sighs]

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yo, Ibuki!

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Eh?

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
Talk about perfect timing!

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
Do you mind giving me a
ride to Isui University?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
I was a total dummy and forgot
my mouthpiece back at the field.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] What, I haven't even
taken my helmet off.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Besides, I thought you
hated this motorcycle.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yep, sure do.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
Didn't you get this hunk o' junk
from your shitty older brother?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
That's the one.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
You might remember,
he's the guy you roundhoused?

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] He's lowest
possible form of human.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
Just thinking about him
is starting to piss me off.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
But what really grinds my gears

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
is how you still haven't
managed to grow a backbone.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying, you gotta
look out for yourself, man.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI sighs]

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.014 position:50% align:center
Well, come on Ibuki, Giddyup!

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
We better get a move-on
before it gets dark out!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
You are such a monster--

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
they're definitely going
to write books about you.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
You guys be careful, okay?

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI gasps]

[NATSUSA]
Hello, hello--answer the door!

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
Hurry up, Ibuki.
I know you're in there!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
Don't you ignore me!

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
I know you're the two-bit punk
who knocked up my little sister,

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
and if you don't
show your face--

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
You're a piece of work.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Oh, yeah? Did those
words strike a nerve?

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Hey! How'd you get
past the front door?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Can I come in?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
No, you can't!

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] So you want me
to scream again?

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
You're pushing your luck, kiddo.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
Keep pushing it,
and I might just end up

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
having to break you in half.
You catching my drift?

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
You talk a big game, but I don't
think you have it in ya, bro.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
You wanna try me?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Oops, my bad!
That must have hurt.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
I forgot I was wearing
my brass knuckles today!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Oh, no worries.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
Accidents happen
sometimes. I get it.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Man I hate to say it,
but you always were

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
too predictable
for your own good.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
Here. For you.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
It's a club application form.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
Could you fill it out and
bring it with you on Monday?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
Listen. Please.
This isn't a good idea--

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
And another thing...

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
Surprise. There was a ton of
stuff crammed in your mailbox!

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center
If you don't pay your
electric bill real soon,

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
they might turn it off.
Anyway, I'll catch you later.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
[sighs] How the hell
does that psycho know

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
the access code to my mailbox?

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
Ugh. He's always scheming.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
I can't. I've already
hung up my jersey for good.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
[phone dinging]

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Ugh, finally.
I'm glad I caught you!

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
Natsusa.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Is it true you quit the club?

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
Where are you right now?

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
I heard you left the dorms
and didn't say anything. What--

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hello? Stupid connection.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
Ibuki! Can you hear me?

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Sorry. I'm an idiot.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
I should have never
used that bike.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Aw, jeez.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
Are you banged up
worse than they thought?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
Is that why you left the team?

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
But didn't the doctors
say your injuries

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
wouldn't affect your mobility?
You can still play, right?

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
Listen, I can't do
anything for you, kiddo.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
What's that?

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.798 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
I'm finished. I quit.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Huh?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
No more rugby.
If you can't play anymore,

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
then, I shouldn't play either.
I don't deserve to.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Dude, what
are you talking about?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] I know it's not
the same, so you don't

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
have to forgive me.
Or ever see me again.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Wait a second!

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hey!

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
[BOTH meowing]

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Hm?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
That's just great.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
Better go shopping.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI gasps]
How? You're kidding me!

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
So fill me in.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
You aren't actually
trying to seduce Ibuki

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
back onto the team, are you?

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
You know it, baby!

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
[SUNAO]
Why are you talking like that?

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
Weirdo. Anyway,
what's the progress?

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
I tried ambushing him at his
apartment and punching him

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
with some brass knuckles,
but that didn't seem to work.

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
How far did you think assaulting
him was gonna get you?

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
And why do you even want him
to rejoin the club so badly?

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.602 position:50% align:center
I just think that our team

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
has a significantly higher
chance of winning games

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
if he starts playing with
us again, that's all.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
We won the last two fixtures
in the Kansai League.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
It seems we've managed
just fine without him.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
You're not wrong, but
you can't possibly think

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
facing off against Koufuuin
will be nearly as easy.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
I want us to be in first place,
not second place.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell me you
already forgot how smoothly

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
our matches went when Ibuki
was still our Number Ten.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
Wasn't it sexy?

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
Go for it!

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I remember.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] You know, Sunao,
with him on our side,

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
you'll be able to pull off
all sorts of dreamy maneuvers.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
There's no point
arguing with you.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Does everybody from
the sticks end up

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
as persuasive as you, Natsusa?

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
Hey, it doesn't
matter who you are--

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure a
classy gent like you,

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
who grew up in the
fancy part of town,

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
could still end up
talking like a ruffian

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
with a bit of practice.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
[SUNAO laughs]
Oh, you!

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
Can someone explain to me

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
what the two of them
are laughing about?

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
Pong. Believe me, there's
no point in bothering.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
[SUNAO] A rugby joke.
You're a slick talker, Natsu.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] Natsu. You need
to try and eat something.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
I'm not hungry.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50% align:center
At this rate you're
going to lose weight.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
You're small enough already now.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
Ugh, who cares?

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
I was only bulking up
because of rugby, obviously!

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
I can't play anymore, so what's
the point of having muscles!

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Hey, Sei.
Why'd it have to be a bike?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
It would've been way cooler
getting taken out by a tackle.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] What does that
have to do with you

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
not wanting to eat anything?

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Jeez. I'm not
talking about food anymore!

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
Forget it. You can still move,
so you don't understand!

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
So how's that sign-up
form coming along?

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
How did you even know I was
gonna be here, you creep!

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] I figured
there'd be a place like this.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
I mean, it is a
Christian university.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Not so loud!

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
It must be the Lord
telling you to come back!

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
Or divine punishment.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Or you're skipping
too many classes.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
Not to sound harsh, but you
become a gajillion times

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
more petty and unproductive when
you aren't out on the pitch.

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
All the more reason
for you to keep away!

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to change
my mind, so save it.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't run too far
if I were you, bro.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:49.908 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
It's like shooting
fish in a barrel.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Here, I'll help you
fill out the application.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
Starting with your name.
Which is Ibuki Ueoka, duh.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
Natsusa...

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
And next is your address.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Listen to me. Please stop.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
"Do you have experience
playing rugby"? You do. Yep.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
If we include elementary school,

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
that's actually quite
a few years.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Natsusa!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
Enough. What is it
you're trying to pull?

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
Same thing I've been saying
from the very beginning.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
Whether you like it or not,

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
the rugby club needs
you more than ever.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
But why?

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
You took the words right
out of my mouth, buddy.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
You first. Why did you
abandon the team?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
I hurt you.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Again? You tried that already.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
You think your whole
'I feel guilty' drag

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
is a legit reason
to act like this?

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do!

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
I don't have the
right to move on.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
I can't pretend
nothing's changed

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
after what I put you through!

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Whoa. Back up a bit.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
Do you really think dropping
out of rugby is somehow

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center
supposed to make
everything better?

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
How does being a quitter
help me in any way?

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
So you want me to
forgive you that badly?

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
I've already made this clear,
but here it is again:

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Keep on playing rugby for me.
That's all you have to do.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
I want to see you on the field--

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:31.843 position:50% align:center
giving your everything
until I tell you it's enough.

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
It's the only way
I'll ever forgive you.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
Do I make myself clear?

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
[gasping] What about you?

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
I can play, but you
won't be by my side.

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
If I'm on the field while
you're on the sidelines, then...

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
Won't you be lonely?

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Who said I was alone?

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
You don't get to decide that.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
Maybe I can't hold a position.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
But as long as I can
still watch you and Sei,

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
then that's where I'll be!

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
Seeing it all is more
than enough for me!

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
That's my decision!

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI gasping]

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
You both made it! Awesome!

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
Whaddja guys think of the game?

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
You were great out there.
Sei. Wasn't he cool?

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Thanks! Hey, you two
should start training with me.

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Did you know I only
started playing because of

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
how much I looked
up to you back then?

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
Would you believe that
I used to idolize you

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
as much as I loved
playing the game?

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
Have I ever told you how

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
the way you command
the field inspires me?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
Well, the secret's out!

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
It's true. You got me
hooked for life!

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
So you can't throw
yourself away like this!

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
You idiot!

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
I understand. Well...
here goes nothing.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Whoo. Everyone's
gonna be in for the shock

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
of their lives once they see you
strutting onto the pitch.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
You say that now, but I
don't know if they'll let me

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
just walk back onto the team.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
Especially considering the way I
left everyone hanging back then.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
As I recall,
you quit over the phone,

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
you stopped showing
up to practice,

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
and you basically
ignored everyone

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
who tried to contact you.

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:02.786 position:50% align:center
Including me.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Except you sent me money,
which made it worse,

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
so yeah, all in all,
they might be a tiny bit mad.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
I hafta apologize for
being such a scumbag.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
Nah, water under the bridge.
I'm sure they'll forgive you.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
Although, you might have
to get on your knees

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
and beg like a good
golden retriever.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] There's no way in hell
I'm doing that, be serious!

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
--All set!
--[IBUKI] Huh?

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
I told them you're coming.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but... Who's them?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
The coach and the captain.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
They'll be expecting you to
swing by and say hi tomorrow.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
That soon? But what
about my schedule?

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
My mental preparation? This is
all happening way too fast!

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Are you saying there's
something more important

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
than rugby?

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
[gasps, sighs]

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
Nope. I would never.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
How bad was the pain?

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
Hoo, boy. It was unspeakable,
but you know, what would

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
make me feel way better?
Some nice grilled beef.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
Oh, would it now?

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
Fine, let's head out
to Shijou street.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
And we're getting a car--
I'm beyond exhausted.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
I feel like you've been
calling way too many cabs.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be throwing
your money around

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
unless you're trying
to impress girls.

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:12.605 position:50% align:center
Ohh, I know! Why don't
we take your motorcycle?

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] This kid is gonna be
the death of me!

00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:51.663 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
So, cats. Heh. Really?

00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:52.872 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
I've got two.

00:22:52.956 --> 00:22:54.582 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yeah, "two" many

00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:57.585 position:50% align:center
Wha-- Hey, can you not
hack my apartment?

00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:03.925 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:05.301 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Sweet, I'm in.

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:07.303 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Haven't you
heard of privacy?

00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:09.472 position:50% align:center
It's not my fault you're
using something obvious

00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:11.307 position:50% align:center
like your birthday
as a passcode.

00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:12.809 position:50% align:center
I never know what
kind of numbers

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:15.103 position:50% align:center
I should use for
stuff like this.

00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:17.564 position:50% align:center
Didn't your ex-girlfriend
find out you cheated on her

00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:19.315 position:50% align:center
after she hacked your phone?

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:21.693 position:50% align:center
Nah, she was more like
a friend with benefits.

00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.069 position:50% align:center
C'mon, give it here.

00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:24.696 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:23:25.864 --> 00:23:28.950 position:50% align:center
All set. I changed
the passcode for ya.

00:23:29.034 --> 00:23:31.870 position:50% align:center
Wait, changed it to what?

00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:34.914 position:50% align:center
To a number that you'll
never, ever forget!
