00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.804 position:50% align:center
Look, I missed every single kick
while you were on the sidelines.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
All but one.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
And that's somehow my fault?

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Since you became manager,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
I've been off my game.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me? How exactly
am I the problem here?

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
We've been playing
together for years!

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
I'm not sure.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
Hold up, what do you mean
you're "not sure," Seiichirou?

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
Something change?

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
Yes, exactly. I start freezing
up whenever Natsu's watching.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
I can't play the way I want to.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI chuckles]
Well, yeah, dude. That's normal.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
It's called being nervous.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
You know, it's that feeling
when your body tenses up.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
And your heart's pounding.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
Like when you get on a plane

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
and then your stomach ties up
in a bunch of knots?

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
Yeah! You're just nervous.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] Yeah, definitely not
sitting next to him on a flight.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
Hang on a second!
None of this is my fault, okay?

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
You're the one
missing kicks, not me!

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
No one's saying it's your
fault. This is on me.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
I'm simply letting you know
I can't score with you around.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Oh, great. Super
helpful, Sei. Thanks for that.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
What do we do, Ibuki? Should we
step in or wait it out?

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
Don't know. Honestly,
it looks bad.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.003 position:50% align:center
Whenever they argue,
they go on forever.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.755 position:50% align:center
Natsusa gets emotional.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
Especially if he's
fighting with Seiichirou.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
Seiichirou always keeps it cool.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
Which only makes
Natsusa get angrier.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.475 position:50% align:center
Top it off, I don't think
either one of them

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.310 position:50% align:center
knows what they're
fighting about.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.312 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Well, you're just
gonna have to practice harder!

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
We have two weeks left.
It's better if you stay home.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center
So, then who's going to tape
you up before each game?

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] You can do it.
And then leave after.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:57.117 position:50% align:center
Oh. Maybe I'll just wear a
leash and collar. Bark, bark.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.286 position:50% align:center
Oh, good. He's still
snarky as ever.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
Looks like he's starting
to cool off a bit.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.041 position:50% align:center
[YUU, YASUNARI]
Not even close.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
I'm over it! All right?

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
Okay, good.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI gasping]

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
What are you stupid
or something?

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
I've told you a million times:

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50% align:center
When I want to end
the conversation,

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
you're supposed
to keep it going.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
Don't you remember?

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
I'm over it!

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
"Hey, now. I know you're
just saying that."

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
What's it matter, anyway?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
"Dude, look at me."

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone!

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
"Not when you're like this."

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
I need you to push
through to me,

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.875 position:50% align:center
even when I tell you to stop!
We've been over this!

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
The hell does that mean?

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
Natsusa, that's a bit much.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
All right, you two. Oita calls.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
I booked us all a hotel.
Train leaves tonight.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
We can hang out tomorrow,
then head home Tuesday morning.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
And we're doing this because...?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
It's healthy to blow
off steam sometimes.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
And, uh, who knows?
It could help out

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
with Seiichirou's
performance anxiety.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
Should we? I mean,
Taku's still in the hospital.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
We won't be able to see him
for a couple of days at least.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
His family's coming to visit,
plus Tasei'll be there.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
So yeah. He'll be fine.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't wanna step on
anyone's toes, if I can help it.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yeah, but...

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
And I bet you guys wanna go
to Oita. You coming or what?

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[gasps]

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
Wow. Of course!
Sounds great. Count me in!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
You're coming, right?

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Fine. Why the hell not,
am I right?

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Hell yeah!
All right everybody:

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
pack a bag and get your butts
back here in two hours.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
This is so generous,
I don't know what to say!

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Don't worry about it.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
I had no idea how
to use the thing,

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
but I figured somebody would.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
The specs on this tablet
are better than the last one.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:36.628 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful--
thank you so much!

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Question.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
Would you look at this?

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry--wait, what?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
Sasaki said this might
be why I get nervous.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
Does any of this stuff happen to
you when you're on the field?

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
Okay... Um. I guess fixation?

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
I don't know, dude.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
You're probably
overthinking all this.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I'm so hungry
I could eat a pony.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
[YUU]
No need for that!

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
Natsusa made these brown
rice balls for us to snack on

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
after the match. He did most
of the work, but I helped.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. You sure it wasn't
the other way around?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
No, of course not.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, it's been forever
since I've had his home cooking!

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Nuh-uh!

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
Ibuki was useless during the
match and Sei's being a jerk.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
As far as I'm concerned,
they can starve!

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Here we go.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
Natsusa! You're the one
being the jerk right now!

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
Here. Help yourself.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI, YASUNARI]
He's so powerful.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hmph.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Yasunari.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
What's with the
extra-long face, buddy?

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
I'm not the one
who's upset here.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
But Shingyouji was showing me
this weird spiritual website

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
on the way here.
Is he all right?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
Oh. Gross. So then,
what'd he say about it?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Something about being nervous.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Oh... Tell me, why is it
that you play rugby?

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
Uh? To be honest, I never
really thought about it much.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
I guess I wanna get better.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
And there's something
about competing

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
and winning that
feels really good.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
Yep. Exactly.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
For you, trying your hardest
to win is what it's all about.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
I guess so. Unless you've
got a better reason.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
No, I agree with you.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
But it took me a
while to get there.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
For Seiichirou, that's
definitely not the case.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
It's not like he doesn't
want to win, exactly.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
But to him, there's
something more important

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
at stake when he's playing.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
And to be honest, I don't
think even he knows what.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
So, I need your help.
You interested?

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
Sure?

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
All right, here's the plan! I've
got Seiichirou taken care of.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
That leaves Natsusa
up to you two.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
Good luck in there, kiddo.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
That troublemaker's
a lot tougher

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
to handle than you think.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
In case you didn't notice,

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
this little fight of yours
is starting to get old.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
I wouldn't call it a fight.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
Natsu's the one
throwing a tantrum.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
Yeah, dude, whatever,
I'm over it.

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
I know you're
just saying that.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wait, that's what
Natsu told you to say!

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
Come on, man. This isn't
one of Natsu's mind games.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
You two should just
make up already!

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
[sighs] On that note:

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
Good job freaking out Yasunari
with whatever you said to him.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
Fixation. He gets nervous
when he thinks about winning.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
But winning or losing never
mattered much to me.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
That checks out. I mean,
if winning mattered

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't have
started whiffing

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
your kicks at such a
crucial point in the game.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
Besides, the only time
you get sweaty

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
is when Natsusa's around.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Pretty much.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
Listen, I wanted to ask
you something, Sei.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
What are you here for?
What drives you to play rugby?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
I just fell into it
when Natsu started.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
That's the past. A lot's
changed since then.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
I mean Natsu's not even
a player anymore.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
Why don't you think it over
when we visit the old field?

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
Might help you
figure things out.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
[YUU] Natsusa,
would you like some tea?

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.621 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
No thanks.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
I'm a failure, a pariah.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
I should just
shrivel up and die.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, don't say that.
We like you!

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
It's a travesty.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
I should've never taken the
manager spot in the first place.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
Hey. You think maybe

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
you're being a
little hard on yourself?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
Screw you!
Like I want a pity party

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
from the guy who
hated my guts the most!

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
Oh, so that's still a thing.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
You're wrong. He was beating
himself up 'cause he

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
couldn't get on your level,
no matter how hard he tried,

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
which is what made him lash out!

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
He never hated you, Natsu.
He likes you!

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
That was a bit too accurate.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
You're lying to me!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
I bet he wished I'd died
in that motorcycle accident!

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA sobs]

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
Don't just sit there.
Natsusa's your friend, right?

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Yeah. 'Course.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Liar! Charlatan! Prove, prove!

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you heard
what the boy said.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
You have to tell him from the
heart how you really feel!

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI]
What is up with this guy?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
Heyo!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
Good morning, you two!

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
How'd it go?

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
It was absolute hell.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
I-I like you?

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
I don't believe you!

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
C'mon, say it like you mean it!

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
You know, I think he was
doing it on purpose.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
Poor baby.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
What's gonna happen today?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well, first we gotta
grab a rental car.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
As for the rest of the day...

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
I've already got
everything planned out.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI gasping]

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA] Whoa! They finally
installed a new goal post!

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't that great.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
Remember how much
the old ones sucked?

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Figures they'd replace them
right after we graduated.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this is
where you all practiced!

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yep! Breathe it in!

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
Natsusa, let's check
out the club room!

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good idea!

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Man, this place takes me back.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Hey, remember
that time when Madoka--

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
They ditched me?!

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
Did he notice yet?

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
Nah, I think we're good.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, I spoke too soon.
We better hurry up!

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
Wait. What's going on?

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
And what about Seiichirou
and Natsusa?

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Eh, they were killing the mood.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
Ibuki, we can't just
leave them here.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Relax, Yuu.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Those two will figure
something out, trust me.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
[phone chiming]

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI] Yasunari,
you mind grabbing that?

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.921 position:50% align:center
They're from Natsusa.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
He sure bought a ton
of emoji stickers, huh?

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Should I reply?

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
No, don't even bother.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
Let him see that we left
his texts on read.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
There's gonna be hell
to pay when he finds us.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well...

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Anyway, might as well

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:51.646 position:50% align:center
kick back and do
some sightseeing!

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
I might actually discover
something new

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
in my home town! Let's see.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
You know what, I don't
think I've ever been

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
to a sparkling
hot spring before!

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrating]

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
Crap, is that Natsusa, again?

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
[YASUNARI] No. It's a
phone call from Yamada.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Uh... Go ahead and ignore.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
Uh, looks like it's
Syouta this time.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
Decline.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
Now Ethan's calling.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
Give it.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
Stop harassing me.
I'm on the road back at Oita!

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
I don't have time to deal
with you idiots today!

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
[SOUSUKE]
Duh, we know!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
[SYOUTA]
We figured we'd do the same!

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
[ETHAN] Guess where we are?
You might be surprised!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
[IBUKI]
What are you guys doing here?

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
Well yesterday,
Shingyouji told us

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
you were taking
a day trip to Oita.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
So, we thought we might as
well tag along for the ride!

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
Inviting yourselves where you
don't belong in the process!

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
It's amazing here, dude, whoo!

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
All right! Where should
hit up first?

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
I can't handle this.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
I just wanna have a relaxing
mini-vaycay with my bros.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
A brief moment of calm
before Natsusa returns

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
to rain hellfire upon our
poor unfortunate souls.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.414 position:50% align:center
I don't know what that
means, but I'm in!

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
No way dude. Seriously,
you're not invited.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO]
Hey, Ibuki!

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
Huh? [gasps]

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
[IKUTO] Who knew you had
such a nice hometown.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
We appreciate
your kind invitation!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.927 position:50% align:center
Mochi soft serve ice cream
and a trip to the hot springs!

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
Exactly what I needed
before the big match!

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
So, what did you hit up
the whole group chat?

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
We figured you'd try
and tell us to leave,

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
so we thought bringing those two

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
would help change
your mind, you know?

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
Heart of the cards, baby.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
Captain and Vice-Captain
for the win!

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
You double-summoning dill-hole.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
[GAKUTO]
Ueoka.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
I want to try some of that
famous chicken tempura.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
Do you know a good place?

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
Sure do, Captain!

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
Hey, Taisei. Rise
and shine, sleepyhead.

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI grunting]

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
Go home and rest up. Don't you
have practice tomorrow?

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI sighs]

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI]
We always get screwed.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
[TAISEI] He was the first one
from our school to get in.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
When Mako was
accepted to Doushisha,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
all of us worked so hard
to follow him here.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
It wasn't just handed to
us like it was for Ibuki.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
It's unfair, you deserve
better than this, man!

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI]
You've got it wrong.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
Hard work doesn't guarantee
you get to play, Taisei.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
Sure, you need talent.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
But being able to play
is part of it, too.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.375 position:50% align:center
No way around it.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
It's a cold harsh truth,
and Mako and I accept it,

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
but you don't.
And it's not helping us.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
Listen, the only thing we want
is for you to be great.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
Make them write down
our school name in the books.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
Shine like a diamond
on the pitch.

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
And bring us home
a national title.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
No one's asking you
to cry for us.

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
Or pick a fight with your
teammates. Understand?

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
I'm off.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get better.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI]
Sure.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI] Taisei.
Thank you... for caring.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
Yo, Ibuki. What is "yaseuma."
Is it yase-yummy?

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ibuki!

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
What's the difference
between toriten and nugs?

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
Yo, Ibuki, I don't know
what's in these cookies,

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
but they taste hella weird.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
Will you idiots please shut up?

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, is there
something on my face?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nah. You just had your
eyes closed for a long time.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
What did you wish for?

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
Oh! I wished for good luck
in our next match.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
I don't want anyone
else to get hurt.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
Good wish.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh! Maybe I should've asked
for an easy victory instead.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
Some manager I am, huh?

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
No. That's just you.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
Uh. Is that a good thing?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
Yeah, 'course it is.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thank you!

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
What are you here for?
What drives you to play rugby?

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] Natsu asked me
to play alongside him.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
Simple as that.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
I've never had many interests.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
I just followed his lead.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hey, there!

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
My name's Natsusa!
Whatcha doing?

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Nothing.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
Then, let's play a
game together! Friends?

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Huh?

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Sei. Let's be superheroes!

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
It's so hot.
Let's split an ice pop!

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
Guess what? Ibuki's playing a
match today. We should go watch!

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
We should totally
go to rugby camp!

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
It's simple.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
You kick the ball
into the goal and score.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
I've practiced this every day.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
It usually goes in
without a hitch.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
I don't get why everyone
makes it such a big deal.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
And yet, I've suddenly
started missing.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
What's making me
get nervous like this?

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Sei.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
I thought it over and I--
I'll stay away.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
If it means you can kick again,
then it's for the best.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Natsu.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Hmm?

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
I talked to the doctor.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
You didn't go to physical
therapy today.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I guess I don't
really see the point

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
in getting better anymore,

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
it's not like I'll ever
be able to play again.

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
Besides, there's nothing
waiting for me back at school.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
And you'll probably be busy
with training and stuff.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
Say the word and I'll quit.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Huh?

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
I only started playing
because of you.

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.442 position:50% align:center
If you're done,
then I'm done, too.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
Wait a second--why would you
quit, you're a great player!

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
I'm not that special.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Yes, you are. Look.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
I-I-I'll watch you
practice every day!

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
I'll go to every match!

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
Just, please...
I'm begging you! Keep going!

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
But you can't come
watch us every day.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
It'll be too cold in the winter.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
I promise I'll bundle up!

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
Not a chance.

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
Aww. Well, I'll take what I can
get. I'm a little surprised.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd shut
me down completely.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
It's been a while.

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
[NATSUSA]
Huh?

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you smile since
the accident. Till now.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
Actually, I bet I know why.
It's gotta be because I love

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
watching you play rugby, Sei!

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
Especially your kicks.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
Even though I know
you'll make it,

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
my heart still beats
like the first time.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
It's so satisfying seeing
that ball fly through the goal!

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
What a thrill.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
I can't get enough
of that feeling!

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] Right.
So what'll happen if I fail?

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
Will he stop smiling again?

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Once that thought appeared,

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
it dug into me until the
stability of my kicks was gone.

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
And I stopped scoring.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
Please don't make that face.

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
I don't want you
looking so sad.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
Sei, I-- Ow, ow! Let go!

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
Smile, please.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Now.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
Uh... Okay something
like this, then?

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Look more natural.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
You some kind
of acting coach?

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
Hey, do you remember saying

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
you liked watching
me kick the ball?

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
What about now?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU] Even though
I can't score right--

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
you like watching me? Or not?

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
Obviously. No, wait.

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
I love it!

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
[SEIICHIROU]
Whether it's in or out.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
If I get to see him smile,
then I'm not afraid.

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:22.092 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yes. That's it.
You did it. Heck yeah. Go Sei!

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
Now do it one more time to
make sure it's locked in!

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:27.472 position:50% align:center
No. I'm actually good.

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:33.061 position:50% align:center
I should have realized there was
never anything to be afraid of.

00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:37.982 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:40.318 position:50% align:center
Taisei? Did you
forget something?

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:41.403 position:50% align:center
How you feeling?

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.947 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI]
Oh! Hanging in there.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.032 position:50% align:center
Did Taisei go home already?

00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:49.202 position:50% align:center
Why? Were you waiting for him
to leave the room first?

00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:52.414 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to
see him just yet.

00:22:52.497 --> 00:22:55.542 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get that. You coulda
shot me a text, though.

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:57.627 position:50% align:center
Nah. It's no big deal.

00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:59.963 position:50% align:center
So how much longer
will you be here?

00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:02.924 position:50% align:center
[TAKUMI] Oh. They said
it'll be about 3 months.

00:23:03.008 --> 00:23:05.343 position:50% align:center
But I'll be able
to play again after!

00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:07.846 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.682 position:50% align:center
Uh. You want something to drink?

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.392 position:50% align:center
Taisei brought me
some soda and stuff--

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:14.436 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
This sucks.

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:16.146 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:19.524 position:50% align:center
It's frustrating, isn't it?

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:24.279 position:50% align:center
You're right. It's unbearable.

00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:29.826 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.
It's just... the worst.

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:34.414 position:50% align:center
I know. Sorry.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:45.467 position:50% align:center
Poor kids. This ain't right.
