00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
The wound doesn't seem to be very deep!

If he stops bleeding in ten minutes,
he can go out on the field again!

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Yuu. We should apply some
Vaseline and tape him up.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
Sorry. My hand slipped...

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
Let's apply pressure with a towel
a bit longer to stop the bleeding.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
Are you scared?

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.083 position:50% align:center
You're the one that's scared.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
There's a lot of blood, but I didn't
get a concussion. Don't worry.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't get worried after all this time.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.178 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.348 position:50% align:center

I-I'm not shaking!

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
Natsusa, didn't you cry when I got hurt, too?

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.648 position:50% align:center
--I didn't cry!
--Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

You're pulling the skin on my wound!

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.946 position:50% align:center
It's your fault for saying unnecessary things!

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.572 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean you should
aggravate the wound!

I'm telling you that hurts!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
Shit!

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:06.376 position:50% align:center
It's only been a few weeks,
but I feel so nervous!

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
You probably already know,
but be careful of their number 8.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.384 position:50% align:center
I'll give you my complete support.

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
I'll protect Mako-<i>san</i>.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.440 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50% align:center
Here he comes!

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
Failure to release the ball.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
I wanted to copy that play style of yours.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.269 position:50% align:center
As expected of Natsu-<i>san</i>'s senior.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
What a terrible personality...

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
Like I thought, he's a really tough opponent.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
They got a penalty on us at a bad time...

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center
Makoto.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
Be careful. Keep passing to the backs,
and we'll manage somehow.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
Got it...

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
The moment Mako-<i>san </i>entered the field,
he went back to his old position...

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.195 position:50% align:center
Join. Hurry.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
Ueoka is a threat, but I'm not...

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
Nervousness?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
How stupid.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
No point in feeling nervous after
being looked down on so blatantly.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
That's not enough!

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
We did it!

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
I had forgotten.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
For a long time now...

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
Huh? Isn't this a bit tough?

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
That's not enough!

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
Way too tough!

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
I had forgotten.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
The expectations of my high school
and the pressure from my juniors...

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center
I was caught up with all of that
and let myself falter.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
This fighting spirit that
makes you lose your mind...

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
Try!

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
...and the rush that wraps
around you when you score a try...

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
I had forgotten it all for so long.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
That felt so good!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center

What do you mean?

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
That haughty attitude of yours!

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
A person with a haughty attitude
wouldn't be fit to be captain.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
With those words, in a single moment,

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
I realized I was never a true leader,

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
and I became unsure
of what true camaraderie was.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:22.275 position:50% align:center

was so that I could lose against you.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
I was meant to lose against you,
dedicate myself to you, and grow...

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
...so that I could learn
what true comrades are like.

B-But you are so cool, Yasunari-<i>kun</i>!

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
Your plays are so cool, Yasunari-<i>kun</i>!

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
Natsusa-<i>san</i>'s plays look pretty.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
Seiichirou-<i>san</i>'s look uniform.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
Ibuki-<i>san</i>'s plays are always genius.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
Saitou-<i>kun</i>'s plays look heavy.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
And Yasunari-<i>kun</i>'s look cool!

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
That is something that can't
be shown through analysis!

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I guess I don't make sense.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
I don't get it, but...

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
No, it's nothing.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it? Now it's bothering me!

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
I said it's nothing!

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
But I might have made you feel bad!

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
You didn't!

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
--But--!
--It's fine!

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
More importantly! Madoka Hongou!

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
D-Did you analyze Madoka Hongou-<i>san</i>?

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
He's also from Maisagi High School...

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. I didn't analyze his plays
during high school as much, but...

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
I have done some analysis
on him in his college years.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
Since he's on an enemy team...

00:11:55.423 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
When the backs charge forward,
he always stands in front of the goal.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
We won't be able to get a try
if we can't take care of him.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
Can you think up a strategy using the
information you got of Madoka-<i>san </i>and me?

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
L-Let me try!

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
Yasunari!

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
Madoka-<i>san </i>doesn't have any particular habits.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:28.832 position:50% align:center
I don't know if he does it on purpose or not,

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
but he defends by matching
the movements of his opponents.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
That's why he's so hard to get past.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
But because of that, we have the initiative!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
First, you usually hold the ball
with your left hand,

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
but please switch it to your right
when you want to pass Madoka-<i>san</i>.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
Then, you usually swerve from the right,

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
so swerve from the other direction.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
You might lose some time doing the actions,

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
but you'll definitely be harder to read!

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
As I thought, he's so cool!

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
Good job!

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
You did it!

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
Looks like your analysis was spot on.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
N-No! Not at all!

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
If you had told us earlier, we might
have won the last two matches.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
Natsusa...

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
I'll have you work your butt off
when we get to nationals.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
Y-Yes!

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center
Yasunari-<i>kun</i>.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
You've really grown.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
I've gotten some good comrades.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
Really... He's grown...

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
We've finally managed to turn the tables.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
All right! We need to stall for time and escape!

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
Don't give the other team the ball!

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
It's nice to see such honesty!

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
You aren't an enemy to me.

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
Ethan!

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
I'll stop him!

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Try!

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
At a time like this!

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Ethan.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
Don't involve the team
in your personal issues!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
There's a limit to being selfish!

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
No. No one wants to hear that from you.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
You quit the team without a word.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
You ruined it!

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
Right. And Ibuki is just scared!

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
No! I'm not scared at all!

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
You look scared to me. You're holding back.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
You've been doing good.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows you've been giving your all
to the team these last few months.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
You don't owe anyone anything.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.516 position:50% align:center
Aren't we a team?

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center
All right! Miss!

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
It went in?!

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
This is the last play.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
If we falter on the attack here, it's over...

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
There's something I've wanted.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
I want to give my all to someone
without the calculations.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
I want someone to give me their all
without any calculation.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
Yasunari!

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.786 position:50% align:center
To give myself unconditionally.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
It's probably something called love.

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
Something that people born into
a loving family had at birth...

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
I desperately wanted something like that.

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
Then!

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
Natsusa and Sei-<i>chan</i>
will become your family!

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
I want to tell my past self.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
You'll definitely get it.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
As long as you don't give up,
you'll get it in a way you never imagined.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
So...

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
Don't give up!

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
Try!

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
No side.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
We did it, Ibuki!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
Get up already.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
Give me a hand.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
Don't be spoiled.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
More importantly! Ibuki!
You're bleeding too much!

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
I think so, too.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
If I don't stop it quickly...

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
Kazutaka!

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
You better treat me to some grilled mea--

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
--Ibuki!
--Ueoka!

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
Ibuki is really gonna die...

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
Don't cry from a single loss.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
We just need to crush them at nationals.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
That's right. Touma, don't cry.

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
But even so...

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
Losing really pumps the adrenaline!

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.010 position:50% align:center
Natsusa-<i>san</i>!

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
Ow! Ow! It's painful!

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
It hurts. It's painful. I can't breathe...

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
Don't do strenuous exercise.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why?

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
Why would you say something like that?

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
I want to play rugby!

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
Won't you be alone?

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
I will! Don't leave me behind!

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
Why?!

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
That's my number.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
I love rugby this much!

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
I poured all of my heart into rugby!

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
Why can't I play?!

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the wait.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
Natsusa?

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Sorry for pretending like I couldn't see you
and for leaving you alone for so long.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
No...

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Is everything all right now?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's all right.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
You won't cry?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
I might.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
But I won't be hurt anymore.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
Like everyone else...

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
I've gotten stronger.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
You worked hard.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
Thanks for waiting for me.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
Can I stay with you again, Natsusa?

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
Really?!

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I want you to stay with me.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
Come back home.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
Welcome home.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
<i>Collide head-on set!</i>

00:20:57.507 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
<i>Win it! A flurry of high-fives!</i>

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center

...goodness. Thank goodness!

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center

...goodness. Thank goodness!

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
<i>It's all yours, 24--you can do it!!</i>
  

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
Natsusa will be our
rugby manager and trainer!

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
I will probably cause you trouble
in the beginning, but I will try my best!

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>And regardless of any advantage</i>

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center line:10%

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>With a no-retreat, no-surrender attitude</i>

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>We can justify it all later</i>

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Go to the next phase, are you ready?</i>

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Set! Win it! A flurry of high-fives!</i>

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Awkward and unfair and risky</i>

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>It's awful--but there's that sparkle</i>

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>The structure of a fresh start</i>

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Touch and go! Crouch, bind, set</i>

00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Emotions loop and swerve</i>

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:15.752 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Whether it's thousands</i>

00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:22.384 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>We'll try those steps of ours again</i>

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:33.978 position:50% align:center
Sei.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:37.857 position:50% align:center
Are you happy?

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:40.568 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I am.

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:41.236 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:22:41.236 --> 00:22:42.612 position:50% align:center
<i>Set! Win it! A flurry of high-fives!</i>
I see.

00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:45.073 position:50% align:center
<i>Set! Win it! A flurry of high-fives!</i>
  

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:51.246 position:50% align:center line:10%
<i>Awkward and unfair and risky</i>

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:52.831 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:57.836 position:50% align:center
Did that satisfy you?

00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:06.428 position:50% align:center
Got it. Then I'll have to give my life
to you and rugby until you're satisfied.

00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:14.978 position:50% align:center
This is still just the beginning,
for both you and me!

00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:16.646 position:50% align:center
You're right...

00:23:16.646 --> 00:23:19.107 position:50% align:center
Natsusa-<i>san</i>! Ibuki-<i>san</i>!

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:22.986 position:50% align:center
They're calling for us.

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:44.049 position:50% align:center
"Thank you for all your support!"
Here we go!

00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
"Thank you for all your support!"
"You can do it! JAPAN rugby!!!"
