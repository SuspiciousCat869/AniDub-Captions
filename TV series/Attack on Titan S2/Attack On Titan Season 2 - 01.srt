1
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:16,873
The walls stood for a century.

2
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:20,297
A bastion of peace and security.

3
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:25,764
Gone was the terror of living at their mercy.

4
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:30,284
Mankind had acclimated to living like cattle.

5
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:34,183
Then...

6
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,851
The Titans breached what we'd long taken for granted.

7
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:55,156
The fight for humanity's survival began.

8
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,591
Death reigned,

9
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:02,457
claiming soldiers and civilians alike.

10
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:05,356
The casualties were staggering.

11
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,877
Staggering, too, was the hard-won knowledge
that Titans were hiding among our own.

12
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,625
Five years after the first wall fell,

13
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:17,482
we successfully captured one of
these treacherous creatures alive.

14
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:22,247
A fellow soldier. Annie Leonhart.

15
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,194
And yet,

16
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,692
even as the smoke of battle cleared,

17
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,537
the next threat was already close at hand.

18
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:56,085
What the...?

19
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:56,880
Guys! Look!

20
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,557
Wh-What is that?

21
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:05,034
It's a Titan!

22
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,891
In the wall?

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,511
Impossible!

24
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,424
Section Commander, your orders?

25
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:16,752
Uh. Well, I'm not sure.

26
00:02:17,897 --> 00:02:21,455
Is... Is this just a coincidence, or...?

27
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,164
Oh, no. Surely it doesn't mean!

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,338
Pastor Nick?

29
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,308
Listen to me.

30
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:38,340
Whatever else you do, don't let sunlight touch it!

31
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,191
Mm.

32
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,816
For the time being,

33
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,946
we've covered the Wall Titan with sheets.

34
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:24,439
It seems to be holding up.

35
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,117
Further measures will be taken after sundown, commander.

36
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,429
Understood.

37
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,105
Forgive me, sir,

38
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:32,169
but what are we supposed to make of all this?

39
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:35,615
I mean, I never imagined there
could be Titans inside the walls.

40
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,648
Why would you? No one did.

41
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:42,047
There are only those who knew and
those of us completely in the dark.

42
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:47,125
Why are they keeping quiet about this?

43
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,738
It's an earth-shattering discovery for god's sake.

44
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,550
What's the point of playing it off?

45
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,727
Status quo, right?

46
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,832
Yeah, higher ups play it close to the vest.

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,758
All this carnage, and they couldn't even be
bothered to come up with a decent cover story.

48
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:07,404
All right.

49
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,622
You wanna tell me what's going on?

50
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:15,501
Why a Titan? What's the purpose?

51
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:20,078
What on Earth's the point of
having one hidden inside the wall?

52
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,567
And why choose to keep it a secret?

53
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:28,411
I need answers, and I'm gonna need them right now.

54
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:38,684
I don't have time for this nonsense. I'm
a busy man. My flock has been devastated!

55
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,903
I demand restitution! Do you know who I am?

56
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,062
Let me down from here this instant!

57
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,313
If that's what you want.

58
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,467
Will straight down do the trick?

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,226
...Commander! ...Hold!

60
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,499
Let me ask you something.

61
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:03,178
Do you have any concept of how many Scouts
have laid down their lives fighting these monsters?

62
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:05,606
More than you can count!

63
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,065
They died fighting for your freedom!

64
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:09,932
I was with them!

65
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,603
I was willing to lay down my own life!

66
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:17,447
Now, you can explain, or you take the plunge.

67
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:21,609
Your choice. I can always move on to the next blowhard.

68
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,926
Matter of fact, they'd probably know
more than you anyway. Why am I bothering?

69
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:31,015
Let go! Unhand me!

70
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:33,438
That's kind of what I had in mind.

71
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:34,590
Do it!

72
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,158
Don't try to call my bluff.

73
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,189
Please, don't!

74
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:41,201
You think I'm afraid to die in the service of my belief?

75
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,695
We fulfill our duty whatever the cost!

76
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,987
I don't care! The Lord is my shepherd!

77
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:53,412
Let his humble servant fall!

78
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,396
Lord, grant release.

79
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,448
Lighten up. I was just kidding around.

80
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,485
C'mon, Pastor Nick. Spill it.

81
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:21,221
Are all the walls made of Titans?

82
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,730
At least tell me that much.

83
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,298
Section Commander.

84
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:31,183
Ugh. How long's it been since I felt like this?

85
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:36,560
Wow. Must've been when I stepped
outside the walls for the first time.

86
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:42,774
Talk about terrifying.

87
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:52,441
Hurry! I have to tell Commander Erwin!

88
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,286
Hyah!

89
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:56,698
The Titans have breached Wall Rose!

90
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:20,233
How much longer do you think they'll keep us here?

91
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:20,924
Who knows.

92
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,691
Y'know, my village happens to be just
a little bit south of where we are now.

93
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,927
Huh. Town where I'm from's pretty close by, too.

94
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,781
Why can't I go see my people?

95
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,684
Maybe I'll just sneak out after dark.

96
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:40,712
My people told me not to bother coming
back home till I'm normal, so... there's that.

97
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:45,605
Hm. Well, folks where I grew up always
tried to tell me I was too puny to be a soldier.

98
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,536
No question I had the brains for it.

99
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:51,101
I was top ten in my class, actually.

100
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:54,392
Somebody's gonna be eatin' their words, that's a promise.

101
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:58,675
Conny, I'll help you if you really wanna go.

102
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,828
Yeah? Why would you?

103
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:03,322
Doesn't this feel a bit strange?

104
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,914
We're on standby in our plain clothes.

105
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:07,684
They won't let us wear our uniforms.

106
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:08,972
We can't even train.

107
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:12,356
What's even more suspicious:

108
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,757
our superiors are armed to the teeth.

109
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,910
We're inside the wall, not at the front line.

110
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,078
So who exactly are we fighting?

111
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:24,638
I don't know, man. Maybe they're worried about bears.

112
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:26,775
Sure. Bears.

113
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,793
All you need for bears are guns.

114
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,825
Uh. Guys, I think I'm hearing footsteps!

115
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:44,063
What?

116
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:45,850
Knock if off, Sasha.

117
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,829
So what, you're trying to tell us Titans are here?

118
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:53,191
Come on, that would only be
possible if Wall Rose had fallen.

119
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:56,886
What is it, Miche?

120
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:01,772
Tomas. Ride out of here. Take three couriers.

121
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,442
Notify the districts.

122
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,385
The odds of there being any Titans
hiding in the 104th Cadet Corps are low.

123
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,128
We've got multiple Titans incoming from the south!

124
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,663
Wall Rose has been compromised!

125
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:23,314
Look, I'm not pulling your leg! I hear something!

126
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:26,553
Is everyone here?

127
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:28,166
What it is, Nanaba?

128
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:32,218
We've got company. Approximately
500 meters to the south and closing.

129
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:33,895
Titans. Headed this way.

130
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,620
There's no time to suit up with your ODM gear.

131
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,535
I want everyone on a horse STAT.

132
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,918
Evacuate every home and settlement in the area.

133
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,047
Get to it.

134
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:45,287
The south? But that's...

135
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,370
Do we know if the wall's really been breached?

136
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:55,180
Ride! I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
lunch is going to have to wait!

137
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,503
Miche.

138
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,818
Nine of them. In that swarm up ahead.

139
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,468
They must've broken through Wall Rose.

140
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:23,145
Damn it. We never even got the chance to
figure out what in god's name these things are.

141
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,442
Now, it's too late.

142
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:31,351
Humanity has lost. This is the end.

143
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,134
Like hell it is. We're not done.

144
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,426
Not yet. A person only loses when they give in.

145
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,141
Remember that.

146
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,661
As long as we keep putting up a fight,

147
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:48,314
we haven't been beaten!

148
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:57,545
The second the Titans reach the woods, we'll split up.

149
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,500
I want four separate teams.

150
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,297
Recruits and soldiers alike in each unit.

151
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:07,263
When I give the signal, we'll scatter
in different directions simultaneously.

152
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:09,225
Get the word out to civilians.

153
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,267
Do not engage the enemy!

154
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:13,866
Which one of you is most familiar with the area?

155
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:15,193
Uh, me!

156
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,424
Sir, my home town's just to the north of here!

157
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,005
I know this region like the back of my hand!

158
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:22,835
Conny, too! Go on, tell him!

159
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,154
What's wrong?

160
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,710
My village.

161
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,706
My village is to the south.

162
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,107
That's where the Titans are coming from.

163
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,689
I can lead you to nearby settlements,

164
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,183
but afterwards...

165
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,764
...let me go home. Please.

166
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:42,935
Very well.

167
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,882
Guide the southern team, then go to your village.

168
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:46,724
Yes, sir!

169
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,527
I'll come with you.

170
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,515
What? No, you're crazy.

171
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,025
They'll be everywhere.

172
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,439
You think I care?

173
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:56,975
I was gonna help you get home anyway, wasn't I?

174
00:12:57,706 --> 00:12:59,843
What about you? You coming?

175
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,523
Of course. Wouldn't miss it for the world.

176
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,132
As you have guessed,

177
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:13,660
today marks the darkest hour in humanity's history!

178
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:19,331
Look sharp. If ever we needed to give
our all, that time is now! Don't lose heart!

179
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,517
They've reached the woods! The enemy is on top of us!

180
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,146
Scatter, now!

181
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,830
Ride for everything you're worth!

182
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,396
No. They're coming at us full tilt!

183
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:48,617
Huh? Holy shit!

184
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,716
Gelgar!

185
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,290
Take charge of the southern team!

186
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:56,179
Sir?

187
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:00,130
Uh, understood.

188
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:02,863
Tell me he's not using himself as bait!

189
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:04,707
I'll go with him! I can help!

190
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:05,881
Stay where you are!

191
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,804
We can't spare any more soldiers!

192
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:09,584
Give him some credit.

193
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:13,373
That man's skills are second only to Captain Levi.

194
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,315
He'll make it back alive. Count on it!

195
00:14:56,361 --> 00:15:00,080
Ugh, Eren. Another fight? Really?

196
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:03,513
Yeah, well, I'm not the one who started it this time!

197
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,435
Those jerks were making fun of me!

198
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:09,946
Of course. Did Mikasa come to your rescue again?

199
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,886
Thank you, dear.

200
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,620
Eren, we don't throw punches at everyone who's mean to us.

201
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,797
Being an adult means learning how to pick your battles.

202
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,634
You want them to think that you're strong?

203
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,072
Exercise restraint.

204
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,456
Try protecting Mikasa once in a while.

205
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,554
Oh.

206
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,564
It fell. Here.

207
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,879
Get some sleep. You've gotta be tired.

208
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:29,873
No. I'm okay.

209
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:33,131
That thing's seen better days.

210
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,263
I'll grab you a new one if I
can find any with the supplies.

211
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,781
Eren! Mikasa!

212
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,005
They've broken through Wall Rose!

213
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,452
The Titans! They're coming!

214
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,837
Ugh. Why can't the sons of
bitches give us a moment's peace?

215
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:05,905
Can you go?

216
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,183
Like there's a choice.

217
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:13,819
If I may say so, sir, very wise
leaving Miche in charge of the 104th.

218
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,130
If anyone can handle the situation, he can.

219
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:17,934
Yes.

220
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,017
Let's hope so.

221
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,996
Only four of them left.

222
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,235
No. Don't risk it.

223
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:51,930
I've bought us more than enough time.

224
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:04,428
Still, though. That Abnormal worries me.

225
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,075
Look at the bastard.

226
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:11,722
Easily over 17 meters tall. Massive.

227
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:16,180
And this is the first time I've ever
seen one of them covered with, what, fur?

228
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,371
It's just lumbering around.

229
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,223
Why doesn't it try to rush me?

230
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,727
Definitely an Abnormal, but...

231
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,907
Ah. There you are.

232
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:32,554
Looks like I won't have to hold out for sundown after all.

233
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:41,991
What the...? It went for the horse?

234
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:44,795
Aw, come on!

235
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,101
Wait.

236
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:33,234
You must not have heard me. I told you to wait.

237
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,313
May I ask what you call that strange weapon of yours?

238
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:04,307
The thing attached to your waist that allows you to fly.

239
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:19,489
Huh. I'm fairly certain we speak the same language.

240
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:22,785
Perhaps you're too frightened to formulate a response?

241
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,139
I notice you also use swords.

242
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:28,466
Fascinating.

243
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,906
Must mean you know we reside in the nape.

244
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:32,725
Ah, well.

245
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:36,182
Suppose I'll just take it back with me.

246
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,338
Not yet. A person only loses when they give in.

247
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,713
As long as we keep putting up a fight.

248
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,833
As long as we keep putting up a fight,

249
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,005
we haven't been beaten!

250
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:21,653
Huh?

251
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:25,965
Oh. You can all move now.

252
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,698
No! No!

253
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,036
No, please! Stop! Please...

254
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:46,908
Ah, so you do know how to speak.

255
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:55,871
Ah, an exceptionally clever idea, I must say.

256
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:47,041
Out of nowhere, the Titans have
appeared within the bounds of Wall Rose.

257
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:52,918
The recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps spread
out across the region to warn whomever they can.

258
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:57,222
Meanwhile, Eren and the others race to their rescue.

259
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,712
After returning to the place where she grew up,

260
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:05,571
Sasha comes face-to-face with the specter of her past.

261
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:10,134
Next episode: "I'm Home."
