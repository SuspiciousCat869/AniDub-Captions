1
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:03,363
Rookies! Stay where you are!

2
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:04,992
We've got this.

3
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,813
Let the ODM gear do what it was designed for.

4
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,366
Attack!

5
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,378
Someone was here not that long ago.

6
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,307
A place this close to the wall?

7
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,422
Bandits probably used it as a hideout.

8
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,940
A sign on the way in said "Ruins of Utgard Castle."

9
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,277
I didn't know there was a historical site around here.

10
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:47,647
Hey, take a look at what I just stumbled on.

11
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:50,126
You're kidding! Is that what I think it is?

12
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:50,817
Uh-huh.

13
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,654
Can't really read the label, though.

14
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,838
You're not gonna drink it now?

15
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,652
Don't be smart. I'm gonna save it for later.

16
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:05,697
You know, there are worse ways to spend a
night than having access to top-shelf contraband.

17
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:09,017
Careful. You're starting to sound like an outlaw.

18
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,140
I want you kids to try and get some rest.

19
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:16,469
There shouldn't be any Titans
crawling around at this time of night,

20
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,797
but we'll take turns keeping watch.

21
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,222
Be ready to leave four hours shy of daybreak.

22
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:28,268
'Scuse me. What if it turns out that
Wall Rose isn't actually compromised?

23
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:29,428
Where do, uh...

24
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,074
Where else could they be coming from?

25
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:36,102
It's our job to find out.

26
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,685
Starting tomorrow.

27
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,698
I'm just saying. The situation isn't good, sure.

28
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,623
But is it as bad as we think?

29
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:51,913
Y'never know, right? That's all.

30
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:53,763
She's right.

31
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:56,337
We haven't really seen that many Titans.

32
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,269
I mean, for them to have busted through the wall, anyway.

33
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:01,320
Only with the initial sighting,

34
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,527
a relatively modest handful.

35
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,866
Conny? What about your village?

36
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,646
Totally destroyed.

37
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:13,611
It was crushed to tinder and bits of rubble.

38
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,486
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

39
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:19,188
Nobody got devoured, though.

40
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:21,516
Looked like they all got out,

41
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:23,867
so there's a silver lining, at least.

42
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,037
I thought that you said it was destroyed?

43
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,373
Well, the houses and stuff were,

44
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,764
but the people themselves must've all escaped.

45
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,568
I mean, they had to've.

46
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:37,229
The thing is... we didn't see any blood anywhere.

47
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,597
Not so much as one drop.

48
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,933
That's the only possible explanation.

49
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:48,225
Still, though. Something I can't get out of my head.

50
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,872
There was a Titan on top of our house.

51
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,629
Just lying there. Staring at me.

52
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,989
It couldn't move on its own, thank god.

53
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:02,089
But, I just... I have no idea why,

54
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,464
but it reminded me of my mom.

55
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:06,504
Am I crazy?

56
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,880
Conny. What did I tell you?

57
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,018
...It was your imagination...

58
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,663
...Are you for real?

59
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,849
You actually think your mom might be a Titan?

60
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:19,125
Oh, honey! As itty-bitty as you are? Please!

61
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,214
We all knew you were dumb as a bag of rocks, but this?

62
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:25,925
Whoa, man! This takes it to whole other level!

63
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:29,254
Ha-ha. Yeah. Have your fun.

64
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:31,211
Guess I was kinda asking for it.

65
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,535
Don't stop there: If Mother-darling's a Titan,

66
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,261
it's only logical to assume dear ol' Daddy is, too.

67
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:39,438
Basic biology. Think about it. How else...

68
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:42,623
Okay, I get it! Shut up and go to sleep!

69
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,724
Ymir? What are you doing?

70
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,091
Heh. Seriously? What're <i>you</i> doing?

71
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,791
Here to ravage me?

72
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,511
Don't take this wrong way, but I
didn't think you were all that into girls.

73
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:08,404
Really? Well, since we're on the subject,
I didn't think <i>you</i> were all that into guys.

74
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:13,521
Heh. If you must know I'm scavenging
for leftovers like a street urchin.

75
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:17,184
I'd prefer not to meet my maker on an empty stomach.

76
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,538
Look, the whole thing earlier with Conny.

77
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:25,122
Were you teasing him to get his mind off of things?

78
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,101
It'd be great if you could keep that up.

79
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,390
The less he dwells on his family right now, the better.

80
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,330
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,761
Huh. This might be good.

82
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,105
Herring's not my favorite, but whatever.

83
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,458
Herring, huh? Can I see?

84
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,732
Help yourself.

85
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:49,125
I can't believe there's canned food here.

86
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:54,034
What, the... Wait, what is this?

87
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,291
I can't read a word of it.

88
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,445
How do you know this says "herring"?

89
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,348
This, uh, label. It's in another language.

90
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:11,106
Ymir. How can you...?

91
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:15,420
Everyone, wake up!

92
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,716
Get to the tower immediately!

93
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:22,975
Bother someone else.

94
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:25,312
I should be drinking right now, damn it!

95
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,275
You're standing between me and a tankard of ale!

96
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:32,914
Attack!

97
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,709
Think it's gonna be that easy, big guy?

98
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,433
I got news for ya! Aah!

99
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:53,252
Hot damn!

100
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,020
You little ones should watch where you're going! Heh!

101
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,609
Dumb-asses.

102
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,017
I don't think you're one to talk.

103
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,733
There's no call to be so reckless.

104
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,790
Did you have to waste your blades?

105
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,728
That's just how I do things.

106
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:08,295
You'd better chalk that one up as an assist.

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,783
Aren't you the hero. I'll think about it.

108
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:21,143
Oh, no. I'm too late.

109
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,551
The door's been kicked down!

110
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,578
Titans are in the castle!

111
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,032
Get below and improvise some sort a barricade!

112
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:33,481
Be careful. Retreat back up here only as a last resort!

113
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,431
Now hurry. The rest of us will keep
any more from getting in as best we can.

114
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:43,309
There are quite a few. So this might be it for us.

115
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,487
But by god we'll fight to the last breath.

116
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,189
Our heart and soul to the cause, right? Now go!

117
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:51,175
Got it!

118
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,608
I'll go see how far they've gotten in.

119
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,173
You find something to board up the entrance!

120
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,954
Whatever isn't nailed down!

121
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,202
Reiner, wait!

122
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,212
What the hell?

123
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,825
Hang on, we're coming! Wait up!

124
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,345
Are you kidding me?

125
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,717
Why's he always gotta be the first one to step up?

126
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,163
Give us a break!

127
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,666
I know. It's a habit of his.

128
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:26,257
Are they in the tower?

129
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,379
The door's still barred.

130
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,841
Not that that'll keep 'em out for long.

131
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,780
They're in the tower!

132
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,067
Get down here and help me!

133
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,878
Is this it? Is this how I go out?

134
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,324
Son of a bitch!

135
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,082
No. Not yet.

136
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,481
I refuse!

137
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,836
I'm going back home!

138
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:37,180
Reiner!

139
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:46,538
Talk to me, man. Are you good?

140
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,708
Yes! Listen to me.

141
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,631
We're gonna make it home!

142
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:53,300
This is not how we die!

143
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:57,059
Yeah, I know. Damn right!

144
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,586
Guys! Heads up! Incoming!

145
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,264
Where'd you find...? Good work! Is there ammo?

146
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,574
Yeah, right, if only!

147
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,362
It was pure luck that we found this.

148
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:07,776
Get out of the way!

149
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,813
May miracles never cease. Huzzah.

150
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,878
Yeah. It's not getting up from that.

151
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,451
Good thing it was a little one.

152
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:36,401
What now? A knife's the only thing we got.

153
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:37,784
Should I cut the nape, or...?

154
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,795
Don't risk it. Get grabbed, you'll get hurt.

155
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,674
Then, I think it would be best
if we head back upstairs for now.

156
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:48,805
We have no way of knowing if
that's the only one who got in.

157
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:52,681
Huh?

158
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,531
Conny!

159
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:02,840
Huh?

160
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,446
Conny!

161
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:12,676
Reiner, no!

162
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,187
Holy... What're you doing?

163
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:30,825
Wait. Are you?

164
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:33,494
Are you gonna jump out the window with it?

165
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,861
We've got no other choice.

166
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,008
No! Wait!

167
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,447
Just give me a second! I think I can slice its jaw open!

168
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:43,592
There!

169
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,439
What do we do if another one gets in?

170
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:07,134
Not like we'll find another
cannon lying around, am I right?

171
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,621
Probably. Lightning won't strike twice.

172
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:17,264
Sorry, I know it stings.

173
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,718
Plus, the bone's most likely fractured.

174
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:22,240
Of course. It's about how my luck runs.

175
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:26,107
We'll need a splint and a bandage. Easy enough.

176
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,710
The cloth's filthy.

177
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,210
I haven't been able to wash it in forever. I'm sorry.

178
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,910
No sweat. It does the job.

179
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,897
Marry me.

180
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,153
So you gonna be all right or what?

181
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,330
Think so. Probably.

182
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:53,476
Y'know, Christa, I, uh...

183
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,700
I got a little scratched up myself.

184
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:58,259
Ugh. So just spit on it or somethin'.

185
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:01,988
Anyway, sorry about all that, man.

186
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:05,777
Seems like you're always having to save my ass.

187
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,785
You and everyone else.

188
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:10,677
Even Annie put herself on the line for me once.

189
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,457
I owe you. A lot.

190
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,793
No, no. It's fine.

191
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,122
We have each other's back.

192
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,379
It's what soldiers do.

193
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:22,596
I don't know.

194
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,074
I doubt I could ever be that courageous.

195
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,418
Has he always been like this?

196
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,245
The self-sacrificing type?

197
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,068
No. He's changed a bit.

198
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:38,064
In the old days, Reiner was more of a warrior.

199
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:42,879
Warrior? I'm not quite sure I understand.

200
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:48,050
Anyway, let's scrounge around for stuff we can use.

201
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,442
If I have to die, I'd rather not
do it 'cause we're being half-assed.

202
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:54,778
Oh, wow. Well, all right then.

203
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,567
Say what you will, the Scouts get shit done.

204
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:09,998
That's mostly it for the big ones.

205
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:12,047
Good thing we have this tower.

206
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,956
No kidding. Think we might just survive the night.

207
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,222
We'll check on the recruits.

208
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:17,920
Okay.

209
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,213
What the hell's that noise?

210
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,345
The horses!

211
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:32,650
There it is again!

212
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,342
Wh-Where's it coming from?

213
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,420
Lynne! Henning!

214
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:49,151
Oh shit!

215
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,498
They're dead. Died instantly.

216
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,613
This can't...

217
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:58,478
He did this!

218
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,378
The one that made a B-line for the wall!

219
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,048
Hairy son of a bitch is randomly...

220
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,111
Heads up, guys!

221
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,259
We've got twice as many as before!

222
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,109
You're kidding!

223
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:12,995
It's like they're timing these attacks
as some part of a larger strategy.

224
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:15,361
This isn't random at all.

225
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,039
We're being toyed with.

226
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,175
Damn it. I'm running out of gas!

227
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:55,802
C'mon, go down!

228
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:06,901
Tower's not gonna hold.

229
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,508
Hey, my ODM gear's low on juice. Yours?

230
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:14,314
Fresh out. And I've worn my blades down to the nub.

231
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:17,819
Please tell me those aren't the only ones you've got left.

232
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,487
'Fraid so.

233
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,800
How many dead Titans the four of us rack up?

234
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:24,149
Couldn't say.

235
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:26,670
I was too preoccupied to keep count.

236
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,816
Yeah, well. I'm thinkin' I didn't do too bad.

237
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:33,540
Heh. Oh, man.

238
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:37,132
What's a guy gotta do to get a drink around here?

239
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,191
This isn't the time for...

240
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,575
I'm sorry, Nanaba.

241
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,235
I must've bashed my head.

242
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:49,733
I-I don't think... I can... hang on...

243
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,824
Gelgar!

244
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:05,894
Gelgar, no!

245
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:09,920
That's it. That's everything I've got.

246
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:27,931
There is a god.

247
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:49,041
Oh, come on. This isn't fair.

248
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,162
Why would you do me that way?

249
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,906
Who drank my goddamn booze?

250
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:02,969
They got him.

251
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,387
Christa, what're you doing? Stop!

252
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:08,127
The tower's gonna give any second!

253
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,541
You have to stay still!

254
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,131
Let go! They're dying in our place!

255
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,359
Nanaba. Gelgar.

256
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:14,768
No! No! Stop it!

257
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,611
Please! I'm sorry, Daddy!

258
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,337
I'll be a good girl from now on, I promise!

259
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:22,205
No, Daddy! No...!

260
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:26,725
Aah! Goddamn it! Now what?

261
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:31,468
We sit around waiting for the tower to
collapse and let ourselves get eaten alive?

262
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:34,964
That's it? There's nothing else we can do?

263
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:39,889
This is bullshit. We'll be wiped out
before getting to finish what we started.

264
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,959
No, this... This isn't over yet.

265
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,518
If I could find a weapon, I'd go down fighting.

266
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,546
At least try to be worthy of the people who died for us.

267
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:54,653
Christa, please. Enough with
that kinda crap already, okay?

268
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,942
Don't use their deaths as an excuse.

269
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:02,599
They didn't sacrifice themselves so you could
fulfill some fantasy about going out in a blaze of glory.

270
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:06,236
Ymir! You know that's not what I meant!

271
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,215
And you damn-well know you're
not like Conny and the others!

272
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:12,778
They're in this to give humanity a fighting chance.

273
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:16,821
Deep down all you care about is having
the word "hero" carved on your epitaph.

274
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,743
That-That's not it at all.

275
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,437
Conny. Where's that knife you had?

276
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:24,893
Huh? Why?

277
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,386
Just give it here.

278
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,032
Fine. Whatever.

279
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,036
You're very sweet, thanks.

280
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,013
What do you even need it for?

281
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:38,169
Hm. Not much. I'm, uh...

282
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:42,101
...just gonna give 'em a little hell.

283
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,707
Okay, then. So, do you have a plan?

284
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,457
If I do, we'll learn what it is together.

285
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,063
Ymir.

286
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:55,796
Christa. Listen to me.

287
00:20:56,073 --> 00:20:58,123
I realize you've probably forgotten.

288
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:07,486
But, since we're facing the end, try to think back.

289
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,569
Remember that oath that we made on the snowy mountain.

290
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:16,424
I have no business telling you how to live your life.

291
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:17,672
It's not my place.

292
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,136
So, I guess when you break it down,

293
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:23,299
this is really just more of a hope.

294
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:28,200
Christa. Live a life you can be proud of.

295
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,914
Never forget the promise we made.

296
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,947
Ymir, wait!

297
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,566
Ymir!

298
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:44,794
"Live a life you can be proud of."

299
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:49,955
With those words, Ymir unleashes
a terrible power few suspected.

300
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,999
Between her and Christa is an unbreakable bond.

301
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:57,270
A promise made in the depths of their shared past.

302
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,883
Even as Ymir reveals herself,

303
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,012
Christa, too, transforms.

304
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:05,357
Shedding the veneer she's clung to for so long.

305
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:09,730
Next episode: "Historia."
