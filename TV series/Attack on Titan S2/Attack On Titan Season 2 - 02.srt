1
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:06,777
The odds of there being any Titans
hiding in the 104th Cadet Corps are low.

2
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:10,281
We've got multiple Titans incoming from the south!

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,731
Wall Rose has been compromised!

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,000
Suspected by some of unknowingly
harboring the enemy among their ranks,

5
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:25,899
the 104th Cadet Corps was kept isolated.

6
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:29,165
With the sudden emergence of a Titan swarm,

7
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:32,534
couriers were dispatched to alert surrounding districts.

8
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:37,755
As you have guessed,

9
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,129
today marks the darkest hour in humanity's history!

10
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:42,351
Don't lose heart.

11
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:46,495
If ever we needed to give our
all, that time is now! Look sharp!

12
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:47,901
However...

13
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:56,607
No! They're coming at us full tilt!

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,389
Their origins and how they got here remain a mystery.

15
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:05,146
Mankind is still in the dark.

16
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:17,546
Ah, an exceptionally clever idea, I must say.

17
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,120
Commander Pyxis!

18
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,831
Titans have been spotted, sir!

19
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,374
We think Wall Rose has been breached!

20
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:25,417
Great. Somebody explain to me what this means.

21
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:31,287
I don't know. But they're Titans, right?

22
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,561
Would they break a wall with Titans in it?

23
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:35,816
Wouldn't be the first time.

24
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,074
It's how they got into Shiganshina.

25
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,006
That was a gate.

26
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:44,476
Armin. What exactly are you getting at?

27
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,305
Fall in!

28
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,973
The walls are different.

29
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:51,462
There are no signs of stress, no
cracks, no crevices between the rocks.

30
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:54,251
We can't even really tell how they were constructed.

31
00:03:56,899 --> 00:04:00,303
Suppose they're built with the
same stuff Annie's trapped herself in?

32
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,508
Must be versatile material,

33
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,994
and we know it's virtually indestructible.

34
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:12,333
So the walls are made of Titans?

35
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,659
Section Commander! Why are you taking so long?

36
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,497
Please! They're leaving in
five minutes with or without us!

37
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,840
You've got to wrap it up!

38
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,295
Hold your horses, I just need another moment.

39
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,612
Hange. Get moving.

40
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:31,283
Uh, right! Sorry! And our guest?

41
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,308
He's been ready to go for a while.

42
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:45,621
Eren, you'll get cold. Wear it tight.

43
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:48,147
Sorry to keep you waiting.

44
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:50,944
Took longer to prepare than I thought.

45
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:01,305
He's, uh. He's a priest from the Order of the Walls.

46
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,436
I know! Ol' Nick and me are thick as thieves!

47
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:11,851
It's fine. Makes about as much sense for him
to be here as the rest of us, don't'cha think?

48
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,748
We're random.

49
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,496
No, on the contrary.

50
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:19,047
Erwin's thrown us together for a reason.

51
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,105
Open the gate!

52
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,847
The status of Wall Rose in unclear,

53
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,294
but everything up to Ehrmich is safe.

54
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,431
That's the route we'll be taking.

55
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,933
Let's move out!

56
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:40,260
Yes, sir!

57
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,516
You heard 'im.

58
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,620
Sir!

59
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:03,459
This whole time, Titans have been
protecting us from other Titans.

60
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,933
Wait, wait! Back up!

61
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:18,594
You're joking, right?

62
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:21,318
This guy knew? He knew and he kept quiet?

63
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,971
Uh-huh. Afraid so.

64
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,610
Just about sums up where we are with him.

65
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:31,440
Cat's out of the bag now, of course.

66
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:33,768
He's not willing to talk yet,

67
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:37,350
but we'll see how he feels after a harsh dose of reality.

68
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,559
Faith keeps him quiet.

69
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,975
Firsthand experience, though?

70
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,080
To hell with that!

71
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,851
No! We're doing this backwards!

72
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:48,974
If this son of bitch knows
something he needs to come out with it!

73
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:53,281
Humanity's on the brink of extinction
and all you care about is keeping your oath?

74
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:56,068
Hey. Take it easy.

75
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:58,189
You're still not fully recovered.

76
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,034
There's more than one way to get at the truth.

77
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,569
Granted I may not be in top form at the moment,

78
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:08,652
but it doesn't take much strength to squeeze a trigger.

79
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:13,929
That said. I'm genuinely hoping I won't
have to blow a hole in you to settle this.

80
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:15,462
How 'bout you?

81
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,830
Threatening him doesn't work, Levi.

82
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:19,419
Trust me on that.

83
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:24,130
Agree with him or not, there's no denying
our priest here is a man of principle.

84
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,982
Which of course leads me to wonder:

85
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,462
if he's so unwilling to talk,

86
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:34,196
what in heaven's name do you imagine
he's putting above the fate of humanity?

87
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,330
Up ahead, you see? That's the village!

88
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,504
Where you're from?

89
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:44,446
No, but it's close. My people live the forest.

90
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,495
It's okay. Go on.

91
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:51,229
All right. Find your home and raise the alarm.

92
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,434
Yes, sir!

93
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,566
Good lord! Again with this?

94
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:05,476
Sasha! You can't always be stuffin' your face!

95
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,040
Give it here!

96
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,500
Spit it out!

97
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:10,520
We're smokin' that for the winter!

98
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,674
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

99
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:24,821
You little... Show some restraint!

100
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:26,710
Fine.

101
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,769
Eat your fill.

102
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,446
Hm! Idiot kid.

103
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,581
Sasha. Look around ya.

104
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:47,044
Ever wonder how things got to be the way they are?

105
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,665
Why the forest is disappearing?

106
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,637
Why game's so hard to come by these days?

107
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,101
Or doesn't it concern you?

108
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,800
Sure it does.

109
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:01,309
People are comin' in here and helping
themselves to what used to be ours.

110
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,035
It's why I'm hungry all the time.

111
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,156
Yeah, that's true.

112
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:07,912
On the face of it.

113
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:11,726
But where else you expect folks
to go when they lose their homes?

114
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,593
They've got a right to live, don't they?

115
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,954
It's their fault for losin' their homes.

116
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,995
Not like that gives 'em the right to steal.

117
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,255
They lost their homes 'cause of Titans.

118
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:24,090
Monsters punched a hole clean through Wall Maria.

119
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:26,028
Where else were people gonna go?

120
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:31,034
Wasn't their choice. They had to survive somehow,

121
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:34,123
so they cleared the forest and used it for farmland.

122
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:40,217
Maybe it's time for us to let go.

123
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,411
Surrender the old ways.

124
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,867
We're not gonna starve.

125
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,884
Government's willing to pay us, y'know.

126
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:49,870
We'll make money raising horses.

127
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:54,557
What? If we turn our back on
hunting, we turn our back on who we are!

128
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:57,538
Why should I care about what happens to
the people who've always looked down as us

129
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,953
like we were a bunch of savages?

130
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:00,311
I'll tell you why.

131
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,387
We're in this together.

132
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,159
The world belongs to each and every one of us.

133
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,536
We're human. Humans are social animals.

134
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:16,010
It's all fine and good to move to the beat
of your own drum, but when land is scarce,

135
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,076
you've got to fall in step with the herd.

136
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:19,609
Think about the greater good.

137
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,286
No! I won't do it!

138
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:24,407
We've lived here all our lives
the way our ancestors taught us to.

139
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:25,823
I'm not gonna change!

140
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:28,658
Screw the "greater good"! What about us?

141
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:34,570
Right, then.

142
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,906
If that's how you really feel.

143
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:41,578
Eke out a living in these woods.

144
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:44,651
Live by the old ways, like the others.

145
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,653
But I'll tell you somethin',

146
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:51,190
you'd best be willing to die by the old ways, too.

147
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:54,976
'Cause make no mistake, Sasha,

148
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,235
trouble is comin' sooner or later.

149
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,594
And when it does,

150
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:03,330
there'll be no beggin' for help from
the people you've turned your back on.

151
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:08,809
If it means the difference between being
a part of something larger than myself

152
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:12,291
and scraping by on my own, I say screw tradition.

153
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,023
It's time to move on.

154
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,979
What about you?

155
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,957
Are you brave enough to take that step with me?

156
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:24,613
Trade the wilderness of your
ancestors for a share in civilization?

157
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,204
Or is our fellow man just not worth the hassle?

158
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,385
How long has it been? Three years?

159
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,412
Surely he'd have had the sense
to pick up and leave by now.

160
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,428
Impossible! All the way out here?

161
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:51,062
Can they really have gotten this far?

162
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:55,846
That's does it. This place isn't safe anymore.

163
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:03,546
Whoa. When did that get built?

164
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,443
Shit! If I don't cut it off,

165
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,461
it'll just keep healing!

166
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:38,844
Oh no.

167
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,983
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

168
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,025
You got a name, sweetie?

169
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,715
I know you're scared, but it'll be okay.

170
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,715
What will?

171
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,878
Uh. Well, um, actually, I, uh...

172
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:21,407
Uh, easy now, easy. Right, so. The
thing is, I'm going to take you...

173
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:25,459
You do this now? Really?

174
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,150
Ugh! Wait for us!

175
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:32,005
Okay. No need to worry, understand?

176
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,601
He'll be right back, I promise.

177
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,834
How come you're talking so nice to me?

178
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:36,715
Huh?

179
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,384
We need to run!

180
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:51,819
It's gonna be okay!

181
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,386
No it won't. Everyone's already gone.

182
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:58,627
The whole village.

183
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,922
Even though Mama's legs were bad.

184
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,143
They knew, and none of them came to help her.

185
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:06,031
All I could do was watch.

186
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,482
Don't look back! Just keep running!

187
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:31,995
It's gonna be okay.

188
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,572
You're startin' to piss me off.

189
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,437
Huh?

190
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,846
Why you gotta be so friggin' polite all the time?

191
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,280
What, you above talking like one of us plebes?

192
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:49,425
Well, actually. No, not at all.

193
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,001
Oh yeah? So why don't'cha, then?

194
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:56,680
Scared we'll hear where you're
from if you let your guard down?

195
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,348
That's it, isn't it?

196
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,312
Oh, wow. Kinda blows my mind.

197
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,797
Why do you even care?

198
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:07,897
I mean, it's like a wild boar getting all bent outta
shape 'cause someone's bad-mouthing him behind his back.

199
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:11,394
Be honest: the military's your
last hope of being respectable.

200
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:12,753
Your folks're probably first cousins...

201
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:14,389
Ymir, stop it! You're being mean!

202
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:18,488
Whatever! Hey, you gonna pretend to be
someone you're not for the rest of your damn life,

203
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,934
or you gonna be Sasha?

204
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:24,401
Take it from me, honey: acting like you
think people want you to act is a crock of shit.

205
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,307
Don't censor yourself!

206
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:30,629
Um. Thank you very much?

207
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:32,973
I appreciate the advice.

208
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:33,958
Really?

209
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,580
Sorry, I-I'm not really sure what to say.

210
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,745
Leave her alone! It's her life! If she wants
to talk politely to people, why do <i>you</i> care?

211
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,710
Sasha is who she chooses to be.

212
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,086
It's called reinventing yourself.

213
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,145
Whatever she says, it's still her.

214
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,933
Heh. Well, aren't we philosophical.

215
00:16:55,101 --> 00:17:00,217
I say however she tries to sound on the outside,
the inside Sasha'll always be a pain in the ass.

216
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:04,291
Knock it off! Would it kill you to
show some compassion every now and again?

217
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:07,532
E-Excuse me? I'm just bein' real!

218
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:08,915
Compassion.

219
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,814
Hey! What are <i>you</i> laughin' at?

220
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,128
Uh. Nothing! Sorry!

221
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:24,614
Really? Why is that coming back now?

222
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,087
Of all the stupid things for me to dwell on.

223
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,980
Still, it's the only thing I can think about.

224
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:35,938
All right, listen.

225
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,750
You're gonna be fine. Just
keep following the path we're on.

226
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,736
Run as far away as you can.

227
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,415
There'll be someone willing to help. I promise.

228
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,871
It may take you a little while to find them.

229
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,987
But keep on! You'll bump into them eventually!

230
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,348
Now go. Get out of here!

231
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,165
Don't give up hope!

232
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,254
If I can take out the eyes,

233
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,867
it should buy us enough time.

234
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:26,612
Eeh!

235
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,797
Damn it. Only two left!

236
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:32,189
Relax. It's nothing.

237
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,636
Just a big... slow-moving...

238
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,257
...target!

239
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:40,935
Bull's eye!

240
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,866
Last arrow. If I miss, that'll be it.

241
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,779
End of story. Period. I'll be...

242
00:18:58,648 --> 00:18:59,670
She'll be...

243
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,327
I slipped out because of the blood.

244
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:31,664
Now to find the girl!

245
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,578
Is that Sasha?

246
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,872
We've been doing what we can.

247
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,976
Giving horses to folks who need 'em.

248
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,536
That little girl told us there was
someone back behind her on the road.

249
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,030
Said they helped. Saved her, 'n fact.

250
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:13,621
Apparently fought off a Titan single-handed.

251
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,067
Mm.

252
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:19,039
Nicely done. I'm proud of ya.

253
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:22,901
Thanks, Dad.

254
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:26,999
It's good to be home.

255
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:34,024
Conny, slow down! Get ahold of yourself!

256
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:36,430
There could be Titans around every corner!

257
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,495
Wait for us!

258
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,120
This isn't real.

259
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:51,534
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

260
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:55,379
Somebody! Please! It's Conny!

261
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,254
I came home!

262
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:08,289
Find my house!

263
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:17,028
Dad. Mom. Sunny and Martin!

264
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,101
Please just be okay.

265
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:38,160
What are you doing? Get back!

266
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:41,238
But it-it's my house.

267
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,986
I...

268
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,518
Conny.

269
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:47,132
Cadets, fall back!

270
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,983
I'll scout out the area!

271
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,950
What the hell? This is new.

272
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:56,046
Can it move?

273
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:58,286
Not with those legs.

274
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:01,026
But... then...

275
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,838
I don't understand.

276
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,439
How did it even get here?

277
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:44,577
"My family got out of harm's way."

278
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:49,323
So Conny tells himself to shake
off the terror of what he's seen.

279
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:52,209
Again, he puts home behind him.

280
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:55,108
Battle erupts across the land.

281
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,635
The Titans remain a mystery.

282
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:01,242
As the situation goes from bad to worse,

283
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:03,726
Eren and the others head for Ehrmich District

284
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,373
hoping to find some shred of the truth.

285
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:10,468
Next episode: "Southwestward."
