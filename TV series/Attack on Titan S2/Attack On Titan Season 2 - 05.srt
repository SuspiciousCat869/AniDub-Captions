1
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,581
No.

2
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,610
Huh?

3
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,577
Die!

4
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:51,141
Eren!

5
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:40,734
Ymir!

6
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,424
Ymir?

7
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,880
Ymir!

8
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:34,956
Ymir.

9
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,303
Yeah.

10
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,281
Ymir!

11
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,480
Whoa!

12
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:16,597
Ymir!

13
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:24,645
Ymir.

14
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:15,733
Dammit.

15
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:41,814
Mikasa!

16
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:56,116
Got it!

17
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:31,217
Christa.

18
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,352
Christa!

19
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,379
Bullshit.

20
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,713
Ow, damn.

21
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:20,109
It's okay.

22
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,659
Hey! Eren!

23
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,789
Keep it up!

24
00:06:01,157 --> 00:06:02,346
I know you.

25
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:28,047
Well, we...

26
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:49,377
Son of a...!

27
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,674
Go on ahead.

28
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:58,096
It's just...

29
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,117
I mean, how?

30
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,206
Who are you?

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,100
I'm with you!

32
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,186
No, it's not.

33
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:31,406
So why, then?

34
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:44,509
Wait! Please!

35
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:42,632
Thanks, guys.

36
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,472
I'm so sorry!

37
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,653
We found 'em!

38
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,612
That's not...!

39
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,140
Daz! Is he...?

40
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,048
She's the one.

41
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:50,920
Christa, wait!

42
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,458
No. No, please.

43
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,214
I promised you!

44
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:51,039
What's going on?

45
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,387
It's about time.

46
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:05,811
Yeah, all right.

47
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:20,491
Yeah! Atta girl!

48
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,448
That's not good.

49
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,146
You left one out.

50
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,951
Uh, actually, no.

51
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:40,519
Just as promised.

52
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,221
In the cabin. Now.

53
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:55,186
Where did they...?

54
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,477
We should be okay.

55
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:21,429
Tell me the truth.

56
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:30,940
She never told me.

57
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:58,637
But, Christa and...

58
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:15,071
What's it gonna be?

59
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:41,848
They're eating her!

60
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,375
Enough of this shit!

61
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:38,914
It was her that day.

62
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:33,648
We were inseparable.

63
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,479
Don't you die on me!

64
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,038
Don't make me laugh!

65
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:04,626
It's a zero sum game.

66
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:39,901
Some wanted her dead,

67
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:21,945
No! I still haven't...

68
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,988
Right! I'm sorry, sir!

69
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:56,083
Nine hours, 12 minutes.

70
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,274
How could you possibly?

71
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,411
Thank you, Reiner. I...

72
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,272
Hey! Take it easy, man!

73
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,351
And yet, I had no idea.

74
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,660
Not sure what to think.

75
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,682
They're still not dead?

76
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,810
This begs the question:

77
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,742
Don't worry, sweetheart.

78
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,029
Why would you even care?

79
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,580
Look, somebody's coming!

80
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,109
Just... gimme your word.

81
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,972
Christa. We're the same.

82
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,542
Stop, you're hurting me!

83
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,762
Whoa! What is she doing?

84
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,880
Next episode: "Warrior."

85
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,807
Yeah, well he's not here.

86
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,522
Says they never saw them.

87
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:30,936
We'll only slow you down.

88
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,733
I intend to live my life.

89
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,791
And even if you did, how?

90
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,229
My real name is Historia.

91
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,516
or die a cozy little trio.

92
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:45,882
If you're a selfish bitch.

93
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,363
From all the way up there?

94
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:59,611
Eren was caught off guard.

95
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:27,546
Wanna live? Grab on tight.

96
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,979
Ymir! Don't do this to me!

97
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,749
Can't be. She's really...?

98
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,767
Hey! You guys seen Christa?

99
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,729
Ymir isn't back yet either.

100
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,923
Could be. I'm not positive.

101
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,993
Look, don't try to stop me!

102
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,102
Nothing's keeping her here.

103
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:22,858
I'm why you're... a soldier?

104
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:56,402
Make my name mean something.

105
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,255
By becoming your own victim!

106
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,616
Like our instructors said...

107
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,968
What was that? An avalanche?

108
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,876
And still... She's fighting.

109
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,520
Why are you doing this? Why?

110
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,955
Come on! You're almost there!

111
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:19,720
You're not worried about Daz.

112
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,473
Well, uh. You could say that.

113
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,490
Great. Then count us in, too.

114
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,232
Disperse and canvas the area!

115
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,920
Ha! You have got to be joking.

116
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,675
Really? What the hell is this?

117
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,538
You can't do this on your own.

118
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:14,929
That's enough! Let go! Let go!

119
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,277
She could've chosen to escape.

120
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:36,316
Christa, all of you, get back.

121
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:08,462
Ha-ha! My very first ODM kill!

122
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,624
Thought we were dead out there.

123
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,975
Do you want more people to die?

124
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:51,924
I never meant... That's not me.

125
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,094
Quite a story I got treated to.

126
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:57,927
Unless we're due for a miracle,

127
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,915
Idiot! I told you to fall back!

128
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,439
Anyone else not feel their legs?

129
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,421
and claim a share in his legacy.

130
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:20,226
I... That's not how... I just...

131
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,778
I say we dump him off the cliff.

132
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,474
What are you doing? Put me down!

133
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,746
I'll handle Daz, you get moving!

134
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,989
One that will change everything.

135
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:36,253
Daz and I'll be right behind you.

136
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,786
He's a small price to pay, right?

137
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:10,242
Exactly. She didn't have to stay.

138
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:59,373
Damn it! We had a deal, remember?

139
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,151
Uh-huh. There go any doubts I had.

140
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:33,695
Did you want us to become friends?

141
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,962
Your true identity is safe with me.

142
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:03,297
...was to be given a second chance.

143
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:02,050
He had no clue till he transformed.

144
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,324
Oh, come on! You're kidding, right?

145
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,674
Not in a hovel like this, damn you!

146
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,413
Too late to think about heaven now!

147
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,629
Way I see it, we've got two choices.

148
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,429
You decide to take the scenic route?

149
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,835
But you didn't have any rope on you.

150
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:08,225
A chance to finally live for myself!

151
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:23,240
You had to have been in on all this.

152
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,793
and we never suspected a damn thing.

153
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:57,053
Well, it's possible she didn't know.

154
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,471
It's okay. Let us take care of this.

155
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:54,462
Bewildered, hearts heavy with doubt,

156
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,036
Why won't they let us inside already?

157
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,871
They'll have frozen to death by then!

158
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,924
Screw you and this stupid death wish!

159
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:49,091
It's possible he'll survive the fall.

160
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,807
Yeah, I know. Stupid move on my part.

161
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:16,859
How she'll use it is anybody's guess.

162
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,741
Tear it to pieces! Live for yourself!

163
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,553
Third option: you're completely wrong.

164
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,289
The base is a straight drop from here.

165
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:59,698
It would've taken hours to repel down!

166
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:14,254
Maybe. It's a hell of a power to hide.

167
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:08,519
Hey, ugly! You've got a job to finish!

168
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:51,148
If they find him then he might be okay.

169
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,768
But, if he falls he'll die for certain!

170
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,410
You're, uh, gonna need a lot more gear.

171
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:27,920
Ymir's a Titan. How could you not know?

172
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:23,050
It's us. She's risking her life for us!

173
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,909
You're a selfish bitch and you know it!

174
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:00,296
Wait! You're not part of the offensive!

175
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,222
You want to be the hero all of a sudden?

176
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,071
You'll die protecting this stupid tower!

177
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:50,425
where, then, are the Titans coming from?

178
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:44,230
Whoa, hold on. Do you think they're lost?

179
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:36,158
Seriously, give it up. This is pointless.

180
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:10,574
I dunno. Maybe I relate to your struggle.

181
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,833
That's precisely why I'm coming with you.

182
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:05,498
Then again, Ymir did seem to have a plan.

183
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:48,608
Ha! Hoping to go out in a blaze of glory?

184
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:48,290
Nobody to blame but himself if you ask me.

185
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,669
You're just using him as an excuse to die.

186
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:21,219
Snuck inside a church in the interior once

187
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,465
I haven't told a soul and I don't plan to.

188
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,584
I brought some extra rations just in case!

189
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:03,885
Hold on! I still haven't told you my name!

190
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:45,580
Search as they might, Wall Rose is intact.

191
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,688
There's no reason for you to stick with me.

192
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:06,659
She's worried about the tower falling down?

193
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,343
En route, Eren discovers a terrible secret.

194
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:16,042
So we... have more in common than I thought?

195
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,272
I can't just sit around here and do nothing.

196
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:34,045
You'll make it back a lot faster on your own.

197
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:00,611
It's better if you guys let me do this alone.

198
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:57,553
the Scouts begin their journey back to Trost.

199
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,128
They're probably mixed in with the last squad.

200
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:28,109
This is how you want your story to end. Right?

201
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,440
Talk to me. Somebody tell me it's all a dream.

202
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,505
Some people just aren't cut out to be soldiers.

203
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:32,495
I suppose we could use all the help we can get.

204
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:49,574
All this time she's been keeping it under wraps

205
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,169
I have to go back out there and try to find 'em!

206
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:11,237
Leave Daz to the elements and save our own skin,

207
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:48,616
Unlike you, I embraced the name I was born with.

208
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,299
Look at yourself, Christa... or whoever you are.

209
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,047
Sounds like the storm's letting up a little bit.

210
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:03,091
Rate we're going, we'll be lucky not to join him.

211
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,530
That's just it. Thomas was leading the last squad.

212
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,986
Dumb bastard's got one foot in the grave as it is.

213
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,023
Promise to take back your name and live your life.

214
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:45,381
I used to curse the day I was born, just like you.

215
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,297
Shit! Brace yourselves, people. This is happening!

216
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,458
The world despised me for having the gall to exist.

217
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,827
What a shame. Here I thought you were the good girl.

218
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,704
The only thing we have in common is a second chance.

219
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,518
Look, don't try to read anything else into it, okay?

220
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:06,747
Dammit. Nobody said training was gonna be this rough.

221
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:52,611
If I throw it away and reject who I am, then they win.

222
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,477
But even then, what I wished for more than anything...

223
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:58,787
Not bad given the conditions you had to trudge through.

224
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:01,845
We know. A rescue team will be sent out at first light.

225
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,492
We don't want more people to die than may already have.

226
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,484
You're the mistress' daughter with the price on her head.

227
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,526
If I have to trust someone, then it might as well be you.

228
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,834
You'll end up just like the folks you're trying to rescue.

229
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,500
For all we know she could've been on their side all along.

230
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,678
Sure, it's a long shot, but
that's what we're dealing with.

231
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,282
Wait a second; are you trying
to say that Ymir is a threat?

232
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,591
Trust me, there's no revenge
in the world sweeter than that.

233
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:15,151
If you kill yourself, you'll
be doing exactly what they want!

234
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,908
Not for a while. She was with
Daz, and he wasn't doing so good.

235
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:58,474
So, uh... You got something
against asking me for help or what?

236
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:47,733
In the end, clever bastards
forced her to join the Cadet Corps.

237
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,750
scrounging around for whatever
might keep me alive another week.

238
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:17,059
When the day comes for me to
reveal myself to everyone, promise.

239
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,735
The more eyes you've got in your
search party, the better, right?

240
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,241
I bet they're busy laying out a
massive banquet for us as we speak.

241
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:06,578
You've been a victim all your
life, and how do you get your revenge?

242
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:26,067
I didn't mean to get us into this
and now there's nothing we can do.

243
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:41,378
Hey. They'll remember you as a hero
who fearlessly sacrificed herself.

244
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:54,766
Heh. I thought the only way to put
things right was to give up my life.

245
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:00,064
He'll be long gone by the time you
make it to the foot of that mountain.

246
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,748
Should've known how much he could
handle before trying to boost his score.

247
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:01,756
So was, was your whole reason for
joining the Cadet Corps just to find me?

248
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:48,028
Ooof. Man, if they get stuck out there
in this snowstorm, they're done for.

249
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:18,180
Let's just say I have a knack for being
in the wrong place at the right time.

250
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,595
some wanted to strip her of the family
name and hide her among peasant stock.

251
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:55,664
The rest of you follow me to where the
Titans are gathering and cut them down!

252
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:05,131
Know what I think? I think saving this
moron is the furthest thing from your mind.

253
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:28,747
I told Reiner and the gang I'd wait out
here to be your welcoming committee, so...

254
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:25,313
I reach base in plenty of time to save his
life and by morning this is all a bad memory.

255
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:32,574
Apparently a high-ranking noble produced
more heirs than his people were comfortable with.

256
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,467
An illegitimate girl was floating around
they all feared might come out of nowhere one day

257
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:36,602
Of course, if you can make it look like you were
trying to save his life, no one will be the wiser.

258
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:03,390
even if you live to drag him down there all you'll
have in tow by the time you make it is a frozen corpse.
