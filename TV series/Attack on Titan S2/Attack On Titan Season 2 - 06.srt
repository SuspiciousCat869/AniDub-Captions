1
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:03,163
There it is again!

2
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:05,103
Wh-Where is it coming from?

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:12,420
Setting camp at the ruins of Utgard Castle for the night,

4
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:16,836
the Scouts found themselves overtaken by a Titan horde.

5
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,102
Their chances of survival low.

6
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,778
Nanaba. Gelgar.

7
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:25,038
I'm sorry, Daddy! I'll be a
good girl from now on, I promise!

8
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,569
But when all seemed lost.

9
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:28,349
Listen to me.

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:30,692
When you break it down,

11
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:32,886
this is really just more of a hope.

12
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:36,866
Christa. Live a life you can be proud of.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,519
Ymir! Wait!

14
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:45,042
One of their own made a shocking transformation.

15
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,647
Yeah! Atta girl!

16
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:53,510
Wanna live? Grab on tight.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,241
That's not good.

18
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,111
They're eating her!

19
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:11,355
No! I still haven't told you my name!

20
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,548
I promised you!

21
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,319
The main force of the Scout Regiment
swooped in and engaged the enemy.

22
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,559
Die!

23
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,105
The Titan assault fell before their blades.

24
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:36,891
However, standing on the wreckage of battle,

25
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:40,839
Eren and the others bore witness
to a heartbreaking confession.

26
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:43,779
Ymir.

27
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:47,037
Just as promised.

28
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:50,763
My real name is Historia.

29
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:59,427
That's it. Bring it up slowly.

30
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,542
Steady the ropes, please.

31
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,911
What's the verdict?

32
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:14,976
How bad a shape is Ymir in?

33
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,147
Well, she's missing an arm and a leg.

34
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:20,522
And her insides are scrambled.

35
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,438
If she was normal, she'd be a goner.

36
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,705
Normal, huh?

37
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,377
Here, grab my hand.

38
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,329
Thanks.

39
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,123
Please, you've got to believe me!

40
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,601
I'm telling the truth!

41
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:54,677
Ymir could've run away any time she wanted!
She chose to fight the Titans to save our lives!

42
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,052
She had nothing to gain putting
herself on the line like that.

43
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,183
Doesn't that speak volumes about where her loyalties are?

44
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,621
She should have told us before, yes.

45
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,996
She had no right to keep her power a secret.

46
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:10,875
It's hard to look past how much humankind might've gained
from knowing what she's been keeping to her self, but...

47
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:15,643
I think... I think she was just
worried about what people might do to her.

48
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:19,282
Clearly her priorities have changed now.

49
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:22,141
This isn't nearly as complicated as it looks.

50
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,627
No one is closer to Ymir than me,

51
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:27,592
and there's no question in my mind whose side she's on!

52
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,469
Is that so?

53
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:35,324
Well, under the circumstances it
certainly behooves us to be friendly.

54
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,175
Her priorities aside,

55
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:42,941
I'll wager what she can teach us about
the enemy is beyond measure. Probably.

56
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,948
Even so. You say this isn't as complicated as it looks,

57
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,708
but from where I'm standing the
world gets more complicated by the hour.

58
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:00,922
Oh, uh... Historia Reiss you said your name was?

59
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,527
I did. That's correct.

60
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:06,727
Isn't Reiss the name of a noble family?

61
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:09,462
Yes, it is.

62
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:11,210
Huh.

63
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,819
Historia, nice to meet'cha.

64
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,568
Thank you.

65
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,488
How's she doing?

66
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,158
Comatose but stable. The bleeding's stopped,

67
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:33,044
though steam appears to be coming out of her wounds.

68
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:40,153
Best course of action is taking her back to Trost
where the poor girl can get proper medical care.

69
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:42,259
She's in your hands.

70
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:43,354
Consider it done.

71
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,782
Right, then. On with our mission.

72
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,808
Finding the hole and patching it up.

73
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:07,366
Son of bitch.

74
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:10,153
You okay over there, Reiner?

75
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,361
Not by a long shot.

76
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,023
Titan almost gnawed my arm off.

77
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,441
Pathetic. All I could think was "this it how I go."

78
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,579
What else you s'posed to think at time like that?

79
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:32,883
You're only human.

80
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:35,704
Don't you get it? This was my second time!

81
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:37,953
Armin! Remember?

82
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:38,477
Huh?

83
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:39,709
Go on!

84
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,600
Tell him how Annie nearly crushed me like an insect!

85
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,947
Yeah.

86
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,275
That's twice I've nearly died now.

87
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:54,628
What are the chances I'll survive a third time?

88
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,863
This is what it really means.

89
00:07:58,022 --> 00:07:59,747
What it is to be soldier.

90
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:04,125
Your spirit breaks and the body follows.

91
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:09,289
Eh. No good whining about it now.

92
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,878
'Least not till we can plug up the wall.

93
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:18,138
That's true. The two of you have been driven
far enough away from your hometown as it is.

94
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,615
This is it.

95
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,815
This is where we draw the line.

96
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,337
Truer words were never spoken!

97
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,865
Home! Let's go! We've been here long enough!

98
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:35,141
Compared to everything else we've
had to go through, the rest is easy!

99
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:37,811
You're right.

100
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:41,011
We don't have much further to go before it's done!

101
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,249
What are guys talking about?

102
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,002
I needed that. Thanks.

103
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:54,446
Are you injured?

104
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,950
Nah, I'm okay, but, Reiner's wounded.

105
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:00,367
And Ymir's sure seen better days.

106
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,386
Who would've ever pegged her for a Titan?

107
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:05,491
Are they...?

108
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:06,118
Sasha.

109
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,192
We all on the same page?

110
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,304
We'll decide what to do with Ymir later.

111
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,750
Oh, and Conny?

112
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:17,293
Chin up. I'll order a squad to investigate your village.

113
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,054
For now, stay focused.

114
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,569
I want our energy on the task at hand. Clear?

115
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:23,453
Crystal!

116
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:26,122
It's troubling.

117
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,354
You would expect this area to be teeming with Titans.

118
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:30,441
Hm?

119
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:33,977
Hannes?

120
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:36,860
Is that the Garrison advance squad?

121
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,428
Tell me they've located the breach.

122
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,755
Wall's perfectly fine.

123
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,152
What?

124
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:53,544
Spent all night trying to find
out where they're getting in.

125
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:56,724
But between Trost and Krolva District, there's nothing.

126
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,194
No hole anywhere.

127
00:09:58,286 --> 00:09:59,527
That's impossible!

128
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,484
We ran into a search party from
Krolva and retraced our steps.

129
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,272
Not a single Titan on the way here either.

130
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:11,851
But we know for a fact that there
are Titans on this side of Wall Rose.

131
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:12,819
Oh, C'mon.

132
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,168
How much have you had to drink, seriously?

133
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,246
Why you little!

134
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:17,473
Hold on, wait a second.

135
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,511
What the hell are you kids even doing here?

136
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,928
If there's no breach, then I
guess we have to change tactics.

137
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:35,207
We head back to Trost immediately.

138
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,476
You'd be smart to keep your guard up.

139
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,108
We'll go on ahead of you.

140
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,497
How can there be nothing wrong with the wall?

141
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,515
Excellent question.

142
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,050
Nothing like this has happened in five years.

143
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,702
Why now all of a sudden?

144
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:05,024
Feels like everything's spiraling out of control.

145
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:05,970
Eren.

146
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,887
We should talk. You got a moment?

147
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,413
Sure, I guess.

148
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:18,753
Five years ago, we compromised Wall
Maria and launched an attack on humanity.

149
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:23,782
Oh no. What if there's a species of Titan
we haven't seen yet that knows how to dig?

150
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,960
Ugh. That would definitely make
their entry point hard to find.

151
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,724
I'm the Armored Titan. He's the Colossal.

152
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,781
We can hypothesize later.

153
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,634
Our first concern is Ymir.

154
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:37,375
Titans being a close second, even with the horses.

155
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,112
What are you talking about?

156
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:43,383
Why are you telling him? Reiner, no!

157
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:43,893
...Stop!

158
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:44,861
...We were on a mission.

159
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,458
Our goal was to ensure mankind's extinction.

160
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:51,051
But now, there's no need for that.

161
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,070
Eren, if you want the walls to remain standing,

162
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,930
it's simple. Just come with Bertholdt and me.

163
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,736
Do you understand?

164
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,610
Understand? What the hell is there to understand?

165
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:09,075
Listen to me. I need you to do exactly as I say.

166
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,228
Look, I know this is sudden, but we have to go.

167
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:29,177
Right now? Where would you take me?

168
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,537
I can't tell you. Not yet.

169
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:36,087
Just think of it as our hometown.

170
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,772
Okay? So what's it gonna be?

171
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,543
Not a bad deal, right?

172
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,002
The chance to avert a major crisis?

173
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm not so sure.

174
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,304
You guys! Get a move on, we're heading out!

175
00:12:57,513 --> 00:13:02,135
Damn it. I didn't want to believe
what I was hearing yesterday.

176
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:12,770
Hmmm.

177
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,249
Section Commander? Something wrong?

178
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,811
Uh... Huh?

179
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:23,271
Oh, uh, well I was finally able to get my hands on
the background report I requested for Annie Leonhart.

180
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,165
Annie?

181
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,645
Yeah. Took longer than I was hoping for.

182
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:32,679
The paper trail's a bit of a catastrophe at the moment.

183
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,522
Bureaucracy, huh?

184
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:40,790
Anyway, according to this, there were two other
cadets in the 104th who haled from the same region.

185
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:44,780
I have their names.

186
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,911
One Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover.

187
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:58,954
Not much survives in the way of records,

188
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:03,434
and thanks to the chaos five years
ago, what we have on them is unreliable.

189
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:10,400
However, we do know that during the long-range
scouting formation, their unit was given false intel.

190
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:15,383
They were among those intentionally misled
into thinking Eren was in the right wing.

191
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,167
Wait just a minute. That's the section Annie attacked.

192
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,288
What? What does that mean?

193
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,665
Well, it's entirely possible they
told Annie where they thought Eren was.

194
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:29,454
Huh? Why would they do that?

195
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,312
Where are you going with this, Armin?

196
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:32,596
You can't just accuse...!

197
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,887
I totally agree.

198
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,692
Coincidence doesn't establish relationship.

199
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:42,578
Bearing that in mind, I'm curious to
know how the three interacted while training.

200
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:44,701
What can you tell me?

201
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:51,652
I knew Bertholdt and Reiner were from the same
region as Annie, but I never saw them act friendly.

202
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,589
Same with me.

203
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,689
You'd never catch 'em shootin' the breeze.

204
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:57,881
And when they did talk it was pretty curt.

205
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,917
Plus, it's not like Annie was very social to begin with.

206
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:07,072
Yeah, at meals she always seemed
to prefer eating by herself. I dunno.

207
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:11,220
Ah! I think I've got something
that struck me as weird at the time.

208
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,389
I, uh... heard she liked sweets!

209
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,204
I've got nothing. Except maybe that...

210
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:20,054
Guys. What are we doing?

211
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:22,367
These are our comrades we're talking about.

212
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:25,140
Yeah, sure. Bertholdt never has a lot to say.

213
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,571
But Reiner's like everyone's big brother, y'know?

214
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:30,567
You really think he's capable of lying to us?

215
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,747
Eren does have a point. Think about it.

216
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,670
Reiner fought the Female Titan with everything he had.

217
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,101
Almost got himself squeezed
to a bloody pulp in the process.

218
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:43,549
What's the matter?

219
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,306
He burst free of her grip at the last minute.

220
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,530
Afterwards, though, Annie changed her course.

221
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,786
In fact, she ran straight toward where you were.

222
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:59,123
I... I mentioned that you
might be rear of the center rank,

223
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,095
but there's no way she could've heard me.

224
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:03,487
She wasn't in earshot at the time.

225
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,059
You've gotta be kidding.

226
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:10,747
Do you recall if he seemed unusually
interested in Eren's location?

227
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,691
So, where the hell do you think he is?

228
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:20,623
Oh, no.

229
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:27,246
I only brought his position up in the first place

230
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:30,512
because Reiner asked me where I thought Eren might be.

231
00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:35,771
Something else. Once he broke free,

232
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,553
the Female Titan stood there staring at her palm,

233
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:42,296
possibly transfixed by something
he'd carved onto it with his blades.

234
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,481
Maybe Reiner...

235
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,960
What is wrong with you people?

236
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,431
The man's been with us from the beginning!

237
00:16:58,936 --> 00:16:59,810
...You don't just...

238
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:00,607
...Enough!

239
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,556
All of you. Listen up.

240
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,463
If we cross paths with the pair in question,

241
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:09,110
don't give them any indication of what we've discussed.

242
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:14,409
And under no circumstances are you to broach
the topic of Annie Leonhart in their company.

243
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:17,753
Before we can ascertain whether they were co-conspirators,

244
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:20,788
we must find, lure, and contain them underground.

245
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,235
That's the plan. Are we clear?

246
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,163
Yes, clear!

247
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,731
You're just tired. That's it, right?

248
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,130
Help me out here, Betholdt.

249
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,624
Your nerves are shot.

250
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:41,118
You don't know what you're saying.

251
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,533
Uh. Yeah.

252
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,607
It's the battle fatigue talking!

253
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,633
It's okay. You're okay.

254
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,484
If you really were the Armored Titan,

255
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:50,818
what's the endgame here?

256
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:54,307
We wouldn't be having this
conversation in the first place.

257
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,406
What'd you expect me to do? Say yes?

258
00:17:57,431 --> 00:18:00,028
Let myself be kidnaped just 'cause you asked politely?

259
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,419
Right. Not thinking straight, am I?

260
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,439
Barely know what I'm saying here.

261
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,578
Must've gone off the deep end.

262
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,772
C'mon, let's go.

263
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:00,745
That's the problem.

264
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,501
Heh.

265
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,622
I've been here too long for my own good.

266
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:15,599
Three years of this madness, surrounded by idiots.

267
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:20,200
We were kids. What'd we know about anything?

268
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:25,689
Why did there have to be people like this?

269
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:32,062
Why? Why did I let myself devolve

270
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:34,746
into such a half-assed piece of shit?

271
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:38,846
It's too late now.

272
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,340
Damned if I know what's right anymore!

273
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:45,178
Who cares? It is what it is.

274
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:48,055
No choice but to face what I've done.

275
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,517
As a warrior.

276
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:55,467
No road left but the one that leads to the end!

277
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,698
Reiner! Right now?

278
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,762
Here? We're doing this?

279
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,473
Yes. Right here, right now!

280
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,587
We settle this once and for all!

281
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:24,503
Eren! Get out of here!

282
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,558
Bertholdt!

283
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:37,504
Eren! Run away!

284
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:16,695
Ymir!

285
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:22,631
No!

286
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:39,036
I'm going to return to the home that was taken from me.

287
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:42,771
I will do it. No matter what.

288
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:52,924
Bertholdt. Reiner.

289
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:02,810
Damn you! You traitors!

290
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,585
The Colossal and the Armored.

291
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:49,659
Two terrifying enemies from the past
have resurfaced and made their move.

292
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:54,920
If driving humankind to extinction
is indeed the all-consuming goal,

293
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:58,263
they've gone beyond to the point of no return.

294
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:05,309
Yet Reiner and the others devote themselves
to their cause because they are warriors.

295
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,373
Next episode: "Close Combat."
