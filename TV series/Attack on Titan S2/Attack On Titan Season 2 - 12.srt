1
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:06,573
Eren...

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:08,844
You want them to think that you're strong?

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:10,257
Exercise restraint.

4
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,863
Try protecting Mikasa once in a while.

5
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:16,977
Stop it! No!

6
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,843
He tossing Titans now?

7
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:21,276
That son of a bitch has gone berserk!

8
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,739
Damn you, Commander Erwin!

9
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,788
I had this all planned out.

10
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:43,212
Why'd you have to go and screw it up?

11
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,541
Ymir! Conny! Over there!

12
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,646
I see!

13
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,453
Commander!

14
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:02,296
I'm not your objective.

15
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:05,768
Don't waste time on someone who's replaceable.

16
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,477
Retrieve Eren and go.

17
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:21,975
Get down!

18
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,513
Are you insane?

19
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:37,008
Can you believe this luck?

20
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,994
Ha! Crazy, right?

21
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:43,031
Watch me! This is the least that I owe your mother.

22
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:45,955
She'll finally have the vengeance she deserves!

23
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,141
No! Hannes!

24
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,451
He needs backup!

25
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:58,683
Aah!

26
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:04,061
Reiner. What the...?

27
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,929
Doesn't he care if Eren gets eaten?

28
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:09,558
Move it or lose it, asshole!

29
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,457
I'm tired of your shit!

30
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,722
What are you doing?

31
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:24,932
Honestly? Hell if I know.

32
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:29,776
Do I trust Reiner, or gamble on
the Scouts and hope for the best?

33
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,959
Suppose I actually manage to live through this.

34
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,510
What good's another day on borrowed time?

35
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,894
Life inside the walls will be a nightmare.

36
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,031
That's a fact.

37
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:48,354
This may be my only shot at
bringing her over to the other side.

38
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm just one person.

39
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,843
I can't protect her forever.

40
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:58,976
Christa!

41
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,175
No. No more.

42
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,101
Sorry, from now on I'm Historia.

43
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:07,365
Okay, so tell me.

44
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:11,091
What did you mean exactly by "handing me over"?

45
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,134
Would it really have saved you, or was that a lie?

46
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,863
Stupid question. Of course it was.

47
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,207
Why, then? Why go to the trouble?

48
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,458
Was it me?

49
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,272
You were trying to protect me again!

50
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,393
Heads up!

51
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:42,067
Listen to me. You need to take your own advice.

52
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,490
You understand me?

53
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,414
Stop putting yourself on the line!

54
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:51,721
You need to live your own life! Live it with me!

55
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:54,581
I never told you this before,

56
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,022
but however bad things get, as long as we're together...

57
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,396
...I'm not afraid!

58
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,467
Mikasa, stop! You're in no shape to...!

59
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,908
My hands! Help me!

60
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:27,973
What'll you do?

61
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,219
Come on!

62
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,731
I have to be the one who kills that thing!

63
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,575
I ain't done with you yet!

64
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:40,913
This one belongs to me! Wait here.

65
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:45,618
Eren! Don't go! We have to get you out of here!

66
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,313
Not until I've settled the score. Stand back.

67
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:59,601
What?

68
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:06,553
Commander!

69
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,721
Sir! The Armored!

70
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,581
It's coming this way!

71
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,175
Jean!

72
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,246
No!

73
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,258
Oh god. Stay with me, Jean!

74
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,975
No! Don't do this!

75
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:39,051
Not now!

76
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,110
Eren, stop!

77
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,234
Commander!

78
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,313
Commander!

79
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,723
Come on! Transform, goddamn it!

80
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,456
Don't let this be for nothing!

81
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,448
Eren.

82
00:09:19,378 --> 00:09:20,863
Look at you!

83
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,890
You haven't grown up one goddamn bit!

84
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:28,046
You're still as useless as you've ever been!

85
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,337
Nothing's changed!

86
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:46,875
I'm sorry, Mother. I still can't do anything.

87
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:51,609
No matter how hard I try, I'm just a worthless little kid.

88
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,221
Eren.

89
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,464
Stop. That isn't true.

90
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:26,074
Hey. Thank you.

91
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:29,579
I've been meaning to tell you that.

92
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:38,000
For fighting. For always standing by me.

93
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:39,684
Thank you.

94
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,380
For pushing through.

95
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:48,208
For showing me how to live with purpose.

96
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:50,878
I'm grateful.

97
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,085
My scarf.

98
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:03,789
For always wrapping it around me.

99
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,195
Thank you.

100
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:32,407
Mikasa. I will always wrap your scarf.

101
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,136
Always and forever. That's a promise!

102
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:21,736
Huh?

103
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,839
Why're they...? What's going on?

104
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:45,802
They're eating it!

105
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,169
Don't know, don't care. Let's go!

106
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:55,637
Could be our only chance!

107
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:56,352
Right!

108
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,497
That's what this is about.

109
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,881
No wonder Reiner was desperate to get his hands on him.

110
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,506
Maybe there is a future inside the walls.

111
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:07,570
I'll be damned.

112
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:16,342
This isn't good. Why'd things have to be this way?

113
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:19,304
Why'd the Coordinate have to fall to him?

114
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:22,990
Unless we can get it back, we're finished.

115
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:24,795
No two ways about it.

116
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:28,553
Of all the people in the world
that power could've gone to,

117
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,248
Eren is by far the worst.

118
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:33,924
Get away from us!

119
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:38,420
Rat bastards! I'll kill you where you stand!

120
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:49,115
Son of a bitch. Bertholdt!

121
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,412
I can't protect him like this!

122
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,437
What the hell is going on?

123
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:55,517
Eren!

124
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:57,870
Can you ride?

125
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:58,656
Yeah!

126
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:00,453
Then hurry!

127
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:05,729
This may be our only window! Soldiers, retreat!

128
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:15,323
What is it?

129
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,932
Hey, ugly! Get with the program!

130
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,535
We were given an order!

131
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,947
Please forgive me.

132
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,902
Wait! What are you doing?

133
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:42,935
...Let her go!

134
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,484
...But she'll be killed!

135
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:06,943
At the time,

136
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,082
Ymir's decision to turn back puzzled me,

137
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,897
though I suspected it had something to do
with why the Armored Titan didn't give chase.

138
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,592
I don't get it.

139
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:01,030
What the hell possessed you to come back?

140
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,861
Uh. Can't say, really.

141
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:06,687
Probably wasn't the smartest thing.

142
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:10,257
Seemed a little unfair to send you guys home empty-handed.

143
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,254
Just, think of me as a consolation prize.

144
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,303
Are you serious?

145
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,766
Look at it this way, if you
hadn't come to bust up the wall,

146
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,578
who knows when my nightmare would've ended?

147
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:26,439
I owed quite a debt.

148
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,381
This is me giving back what I took from you.

149
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:35,019
'Least somebody knows the shit you've been through.

150
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,070
Even if it is only me.

151
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,808
Yeah, well... thank you. Sorry.

152
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:46,549
No worries.

153
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:54,063
Being a goddess had its perks while it lasted.

154
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:03,145
With reports maintaining the likelihood
of Wall Rose having been compromised,

155
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:09,715
citizens of the region were forced to take refuge in
a subterranean city within the confines of Wall Sina.

156
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:14,768
However, though emergency provisions
had been stockpiled for the purpose,

157
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,565
with over half the population relying on them,

158
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,853
rations could only last, at most, a week.

159
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:23,842
Beyond that lurked a terrible choice:

160
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,913
turn on each other like animals,

161
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,280
or face the prospect of starvation.

162
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:32,994
To avoid a humanitarian crisis
of catastrophic proportions,

163
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,194
within a week of the Titan onslaught,

164
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:38,119
authorities declared Wall Rose secure.

165
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:52,005
Hange. Come in.

166
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,574
Pardon the intrusion, Erwin.

167
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,547
Commander Pyxis. Glad we caught you.

168
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,788
Um, this is... State your name.

169
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:05,440
Sir! Conny Springer, sir!

170
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,172
Hundred and fourth Cadet Corps!

171
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,971
Conny here is originally from Ragako.

172
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:14,706
Ah, yes. Where the invasion seems to have begun, correct?

173
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,663
Yes, sir. In fact, he's corroborated a
valuable piece of evidence in that regard.

174
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:24,112
I think you'll find his story supports our hypothesis.

175
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,154
Soldier, if you would.

176
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:35,100
I allowed myself to be kidnapped. It's my fault.

177
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:39,145
Because of me the Scouts lost over
half of their veteran contingent.

178
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,069
All in a single rescue attempt.

179
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:48,106
Still, though. There were no casualties on the way back.

180
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,356
The Titans completely ignored us.

181
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:53,938
They were too fixated on Reiner and the others.

182
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:58,553
Jean and I, we mulled it over between us once we got back.

183
00:18:58,783 --> 00:18:59,451
Huh?

184
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,670
Hear me out. Suppose they acted that way...

185
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,491
...because of you?

186
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:10,129
Just a thought, of course.

187
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,720
But as far as an explanation,

188
00:19:14,347 --> 00:19:16,269
it's about as good as we've got.

189
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:20,649
I'm not saying I envy the position you're in.

190
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:23,556
Maybe all those people really did die for nothing.

191
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,527
That all depends on you.

192
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:29,669
If you're really worth the sacrifice,

193
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,414
you'd better prove it.

194
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,514
There's no time for second-guessing.

195
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:43,477
You're right. I have to be decisive.

196
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:49,411
If this is real... if I can control Titans...

197
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:51,968
I have to plug up Wall Maria.

198
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:55,265
Then make Reiner answer for what he's done.

199
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:59,800
People died for me. I have to earn what they gave.

200
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,638
Come again?

201
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,000
You're saying the Titans responsible for this

202
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:10,685
were the citizens of Ragako?

203
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:18,279
I see. So, in actuality, Titans are human beings.

204
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,079
Well, we don't have proof yet.

205
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:27,320
Great. Perfect.

206
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:31,309
I've spent all this time. All this energy.

207
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,235
And the things I've been carving through like carrion

208
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:36,950
were people.

209
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,041
Look, we don't know for a certainty.

210
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:53,403
Now what?

211
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,123
Um, excuse me.

212
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,760
What's with that smile?

213
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,631
Oh, it's nothing.

214
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:16,738
Just... seems to me we've taken
one more step toward the truth.

215
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,797
Wow. One whole step, huh?

216
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:24,230
At this pace we'll run out of
people before we actually reach it.

217
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,232
Not a good rate of return.

218
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:29,687
Everything comes at a price.

219
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:33,319
One day we'll get close enough to break through.

220
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:39,786
The wall barring us from the truth... will tumble.

221
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,541
Not just yet.
