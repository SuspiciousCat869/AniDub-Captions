1
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,208
I can win. I can beat Reiner.

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,956
He's going down!

3
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:18,972
Huh? No, no, no, no, no!

4
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:23,444
Above you! Look out!

5
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,871
Eren!

6
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:46,297
Ugh.

7
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,205
You're kidding me. Wake up, Commander.

8
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,794
You'll catch your death sleeping out here.

9
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,381
Tell me you didn't drink all this yourself.

10
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,696
God. Sir, please.

11
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,814
Keep tossing it back like someone half
your age, I'll end up putting you in diapers.

12
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,806
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

13
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:07,799
Old men like to be doted on.

14
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,809
What's the situation?

15
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:14,021
Well, several patrol units were sent out.

16
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,317
Not many Titans between the
first and second defensive lines.

17
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:21,020
And the few that did crop up seemed
like they were pretty far apart.

18
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,022
Hmm.

19
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:26,405
If Hannes and the advance squad have
managed to follow the wall without incident,

20
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,766
they should be getting back before too long.

21
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:32,261
Fairly straightforward operation.

22
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:36,831
They'd have run into the unit from Krolva
about halfway and turned around for home.

23
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:41,518
It's a safe assumption they
encountered few Titans, if any.

24
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,457
If Wall Rose had been breached,

25
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,983
sightings wouldn't be so random.

26
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:51,917
Commander Pyxis.

27
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:52,544
Hm?

28
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,494
Ah, Commander Erwin.

29
00:04:57,082 --> 00:05:00,688
Is it true what I hear about you
catching a troublesome little mouse?

30
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:03,056
Well... technically, yes.

31
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,684
Not that it's helped us.

32
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:10,541
Hm. Well, at least those goons in the
interior might start using their heads.

33
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,559
Might even be forced to reconsider their belief system.

34
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:15,743
Morally bankrupt as it is.

35
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,501
Agreed. Seems they have.

36
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:19,995
Look over there.

37
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:26,199
Military Police putting in an appearance
where Titans aren't just an academic problem.

38
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,816
Damn. Can't believe we didn't see one.

39
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,040
You really sayin' there weren't any?

40
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,605
I know, right?

41
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,645
It's unusually quiet out there.

42
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:42,358
Wonder if they're still alive.

43
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,991
What a joke. I thought this
was s'posed to be an emergency.

44
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:49,024
Yeah. We just come here to sit on our asses, or what?

45
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:52,594
Hey Levi! Where you hidin' all the Titans?

46
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:54,849
Problem?

47
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,685
You seem eager to be eaten alive, soldier.

48
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,381
Huh. Sorry we couldn't make that happen for you today.

49
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:05,869
Plenty of opportunities outside
the wall if you're lookin'.

50
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:08,340
Lots of scouting expeditions.

51
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,464
I'd be more than happy for the help.

52
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,466
We could all fight Titans together.

53
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,261
Well, you know.

54
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,225
There's our work in the interior, so...

55
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,758
Hey! The advance squad is back!

56
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,118
Go! Tell Commander Pyxis!

57
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:30,839
I see. No breach as far as you could tell, correct?

58
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,358
That's correct, sir!

59
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,227
Mmm. As I thought.

60
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:41,303
But, sir! A situation has developed!

61
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,856
You see, we ran into another
group on the way back to Trost.

62
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:48,034
It was the Scout unit led by Section Commander Hange.

63
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:52,481
There were recruits from the 104th Cadet
Corps with them, none of whom had equipment.

64
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,969
This may sound crazy, sir, but three of them

65
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,003
were Titans!

66
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:58,839
What the...?

67
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,493
Hang on a sec. Seriously? You
mean like there were three... more?

68
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:07,293
But... who were they? Who, damn it?

69
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,644
Actually, I, um...

70
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,114
Jean, calm down.

71
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:14,571
What happened when their Titan forms were revealed?

72
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:18,709
The Scouts faced them. The Armored
Titan and the Colossal head on.

73
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:23,898
But by the time our unit arrived
on the scene it was... too late.

74
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:25,589
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,469
Oh, man. What a mess.

76
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:50,664
Count your lucky stars we were all the way up here.

77
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:56,201
Rest of 'em got blasted by steam
and debris; nothing much they could do.

78
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:01,366
How badly is Mikasa hurt?

79
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,772
Well there aren't any wounds to speak of.

80
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,631
I think it's just a concussion.

81
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:07,579
Could be worse.

82
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,869
Armin, I've got food if you're hungry.

83
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:13,877
You eaten?

84
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,266
Be right back.

85
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,550
Mikasa!

86
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:45,196
Come quick! Eren's in trouble!

87
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,389
What kind of trouble?

88
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,179
It's those three bullies again.

89
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,339
They took the bread I just bought.

90
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:55,091
I... I told Eren about it and...

91
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:58,053
I didn't want him to go!

92
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:00,500
Wait!

93
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,256
Give it back.

94
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,392
You have dirt in your ears or somethin'?

95
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,592
Like I said, I already ate the whole thing.

96
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,039
Tasty.

97
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,640
But that was three days worth of food for them!

98
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:12,805
You gotta be kiddin' me.

99
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:14,355
Those table scraps?

100
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:17,803
Knock it off. You'll make me feel bad.

101
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:20,219
Whatever, you want it back so damn much...

102
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,704
Pay him back what the bread was worth!

103
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,462
Whoa! What are you doing?

104
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,203
Hey! There's a situation over here if you hadn't noticed!

105
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,015
Get off your drunk asses!

106
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,678
Ugh, come on. They're just kids
bein' kids. Let 'em work it out.

107
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,015
They're demolishing my stall!

108
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,789
This, uh, ain't our thing.

109
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:54,237
Best wait for someone more qualified
to come along and sort it out.

110
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:55,382
Huh?

111
00:09:58,226 --> 00:09:59,083
Eren!

112
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,432
Eat this, punk!

113
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,076
Mikasa...!

114
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,802
I've got this. What are you doing?

115
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,685
Eren, you need to go home and chop wood.

116
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,957
You want your mom to get angry?

117
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:23,506
You little... Now it's a fight!

118
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,446
You asked for it...!

119
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,082
No! It's okay! She can handle it!

120
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,132
Let go!

121
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,758
Oh-ho! Nice one!

122
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:36,838
Don't let her do all the work!

123
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,494
What was that for?

124
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:43,662
Don't cheer the little bastards on! Damn freeloaders!

125
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:47,349
Freeloaders? D'you just call us freeloaders?

126
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,375
Hey, if the shoe fits, shove it up your ass!

127
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:51,829
You son of a...!

128
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,372
Hey. Hey! He's got a point, y'know.

129
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:55,667
I mean...

130
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:02,490
Heh. That's some right arm.

131
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,920
For a chump who runs a stall!

132
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,640
Yeah! Get him, Hannes!

133
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,374
Come on, man!

134
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:20,511
Don't get beat by a soldier!

135
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,076
Stop it right now!

136
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:23,673
What the hell is wrong with you?

137
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,501
Act like adults!

138
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:26,446
Give it back!

139
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,621
Damn it!

140
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:38,982
That's enough!

141
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:41,468
Uh-oh. Hey, guys?

142
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:43,470
This is gettin' kinda serious.

143
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:46,538
Screw this! We're outta here!

144
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:47,895
Get back here!

145
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:50,889
...Where d'you think you're...

146
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:51,686
...No, Eren!

147
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:53,999
I don't care about the stupid bread!

148
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:54,896
Let it go!

149
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,826
That's enough. We're going back home right this instant.

150
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,479
Like hell! Go without me!

151
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:00,329
Eren! Wait!

152
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:01,522
No you don't!

153
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,184
Hold on! Eren!

154
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,459
Eren!

155
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,616
Mikasa.

156
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,500
Where is Eren? Where did he go?

157
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,130
Whoa! Calm down!

158
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,839
Wait! You shouldn't...!

159
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,767
We don't know how badly you're hurt!

160
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,741
Where is he?

161
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,746
Eren and Ymir were taken.

162
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,710
They're gone. Reiner and Bertholdt abducted them.

163
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:07,893
He fought, but the Armored Titan was just too...

164
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,801
That was about five hours ago.

165
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,268
Somebody's gone after them, right?

166
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,294
Tell me somebody went after them.

167
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:23,591
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,755
Why not?

169
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,305
We wanted to, but the horses

170
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:30,884
are on the other side of the wall.

171
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,913
Our only option is to wait.

172
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,808
The mounts can't be hauled over until
the lifts make it here and that takes time.

173
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,922
There's nothing else we can do right now.

174
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,959
Section Commander Hange and the
other officers are too injured to move.

175
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:50,184
We don't have enough soldiers to form a scouting party.

176
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:52,551
Even a small one would need more than this.

177
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:54,934
We just can't do it.

178
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,415
You understand?

179
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,837
Damn it. Not this again.

180
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,047
You feel any pain?

181
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,392
No. I hit my head, but I think I'm okay now.

182
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,140
Don't worry about it.

183
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,277
It's just...

184
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:20,036
...not the first time I've been down this road.

185
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:23,055
Except when Annie took him,

186
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,851
I didn't waste a second. Not one.

187
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:30,991
That's how Captain Levi and I were able to get him back.

188
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:38,443
But... it's already been five hours.

189
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,743
Hey, Armin.

190
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:57,239
Why's he do it? Always leave?

191
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:59,983
Always end up someplace we're not?

192
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,724
Yeah, it does seem to happen a lot.

193
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:08,338
Ever since we were kids Eren liked to run off on his own.

194
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,284
Leave us worried sick.

195
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:17,062
Who knows? That's just the sort
of person he's meant to be. Maybe.

196
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,580
I don't want much.

197
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,798
Just to be near him.

198
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:35,963
That's all.

199
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,075
Good. You're awake.

200
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:54,523
Must be starving. Here.

201
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,377
Heads up, Armin.

202
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:03,183
Sorry it's only field rations,
but better than nothing, I guess.

203
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:12,469
Not bad. Not good either. Nothing new there.

204
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,275
Aaah.

205
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,089
Speaking of which, this feels familiar, huh?

206
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:26,896
You two've been runnin' damage control for that little
hothead since the good ol' days, if I recall correctly.

207
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,202
Doesn't seem very fair, but what do I know?

208
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:35,085
Different time, different place, same problem.

209
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:38,296
Not exactly what I'd call a healthy relationship.

210
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,154
Am I wrong?

211
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,310
The neighborhood bullies weren't quite so tall,

212
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,772
but I suppose there are similarities.

213
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,982
Yep. That's our Eren. Heh.

214
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,953
Can't hold his own for shit,
but always lookin' for a fight.

215
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:57,988
Five guys wanna take him on, he'd wouldn't think
twice about jumping into the fray like an idiot.

216
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:02,952
By the time Mikasa gets there or the
MPs show up, he's beaten all to hell.

217
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:05,424
But you know...

218
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:10,143
I may not've ever had the privilege of seeing Eren win,

219
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:13,465
but I never saw the little
son of a bitch back down either.

220
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,422
Kid's got fire.

221
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,726
To tell the truth, his persistence
scares the piss outta me sometimes.

222
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:25,572
He gets knocked on his ass, he gets right back up again.

223
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,256
It's in his blood.

224
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:31,307
You think he'd let himself be snatched
away without fighting tooth and nail?

225
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,006
Not a chance.

226
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,965
Whatever strength he's got left, he'll use it.

227
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,617
What's two guys next to a whole gang?

228
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:42,002
If you can count on anything,
it's that Eren'll give 'em hell.

229
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,623
At least till you or me shows up to help.

230
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:46,849
That's how it's always been, right?

231
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,043
Yes, sir. Those good ol' days were somethin' else.

232
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,190
'Course if you ask Eren,

233
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,922
he'd tell ya they were an illusion.

234
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:03,877
Just us kidding ourselves.

235
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,558
But I for one was never happier than when folks
thought of me as a freeloading waste of space.

236
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:17,397
There's not much I wouldn't do to get us back
to how things used to be. Call me sentimental.

237
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,997
But I'm willing to fight for it.

238
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,334
He needs us.

239
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:27,042
Whaddya say we stick to what we know.

240
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:30,030
It ain't the good ol' days 'less
the three of you are together.

241
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:00,900
They're here.

242
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:02,720
Is that?

243
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,339
Oh, wow.

244
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,462
Ah!

245
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:07,824
Commander Erwin!

246
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:09,818
With MPs!

247
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,973
Never thought they'd ride on top of the wall.

248
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:17,524
Probably the quickest route here.

249
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:22,291
For the record, I know you won't,

250
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,596
but I'd much prefer if you stayed behind.

251
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:27,566
No, not happening. Nice try, though.

252
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:31,077
As long as Ymir's in danger, nothing will keep me here.

253
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,755
Sorry. That's just how it is.

254
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,179
We're all in this together, Armin.

255
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:38,723
You're not special.

256
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:41,033
Every one of us has a reason for going.

257
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,871
Still trying to process mine, to be honest.

258
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:47,668
Why did Bertholdt and Reiner do what they did?

259
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,331
I wanna ask while I look them dead in the eye.

260
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,036
Good to see you, Commander Erwin.

261
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:58,076
Glad you're here.

262
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:00,372
Is the situation still the same?

263
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:01,142
...Yes, sir.

264
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:01,825
...Good.

265
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,089
Right! Deploy the lifts!

266
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,763
Hange?

267
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:10,460
Don't just stand there. Gi-Give me a map.

268
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:21,075
It's a gamble, but the trees in this forest
are massive. I say we ride straight for it.

269
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,650
See, even if they had a way to
cover the Armored Titan's footprints,

270
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:29,330
this is almost definitely where we would find them.

271
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:30,776
Why's that?

272
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:32,964
They need to recoup.

273
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,356
They have the power to assume Titan form,

274
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:38,934
but other Titans on that side
of the wall still pose a threat.

275
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,073
Especially after putting up such a fight.

276
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,352
Yes, Eren was the worse for it,

277
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:46,536
but they've got to be spent.

278
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:49,573
Remember when Annie went out cold?

279
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:53,084
Let's suppose they're headed somewhere beyond Wall Maria.

280
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:55,054
That's not a simple hike.

281
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:58,940
They'll need all the rest they can get
before covering that kind of distance.

282
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,982
They're in no shape to make it in a single push.

283
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:06,965
And if so, they'll want to catch their
breath somewhere other Titans can't get to them.

284
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,508
Odds are they'll hold out till it gets dark.

285
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,653
You're awake.

286
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,169
Welcome back.

287
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:51,121
We have until sundown!

288
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:58,479
If we can reach the forest by then, we
might just have a chance to save them!

289
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,062
Let's move!

290
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,212
Eren wakes, surrounded by trees.

291
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:51,485
Desperate to escape, he attempts to transform,
only for Ymir to convince him otherwise.

292
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,598
Deep in the isolated forest,

293
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:56,910
emotions reach the boiling point.

294
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,817
Eren and Reiner clash.

295
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:02,160
This must be settled once and for all.

296
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,515
For themselves, and for all who've perished.

297
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:09,626
Next episode: "Opening."
