1
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:10,544
Let's move!

2
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:23,762
Hange?

3
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,409
Get, get me a horse.

4
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:29,443
Section Commander! Where're you going?

5
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:33,599
Back to the village where we
caught the Titan that couldn't walk.

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,243
Not Ragako!

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,937
I need to see.

8
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,031
Have you lost touch with reality?

9
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:43,261
You're in no condition to ride horseback right now!

10
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,122
There's something important there.

11
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,139
I feel it in my bones.

12
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:53,216
All right, fine.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,512
I'll go myself.

14
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:58,761
You stay here and quit trying to move!

15
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:08,399
Be on the lookout! All riders assume formation!

16
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:19,616
Eren.

17
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:00,529
You're awake.

18
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,048
Welcome back.

19
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:25,875
What the hell? My arms!

20
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,298
Eren.

21
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,810
I'm, uh, not in any better shape here.

22
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,876
Seems we're both having a shit day.

23
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:39,152
Ymir. What did they... What did they do to me?

24
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,911
Sorry. That was... That was my fault.

25
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,802
You can pin your injuries on me.

26
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:49,384
Guess I was in kind of a hurry back there.

27
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:52,245
Bit your nape without thinking about your arms.

28
00:03:55,676 --> 00:04:00,489
Is that right? So. I lost.

29
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,677
Eren! Don't do it!

30
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:14,401
Easy there, hothead.

31
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,802
Take a look at where we are.

32
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,218
This is the giant forest within Wall Maria.

33
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:23,248
Wall Rose is leagues away.

34
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,674
Which means... we're deep in
the heart of Titan country. See?

35
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,820
I think our buddy down there is an abnormal.

36
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,975
It may look like he's just kickin' back,

37
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,765
but those eyes haven't left us once.

38
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,110
Lot of smaller ones down there, too.

39
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:46,026
That's plenty bad enough. Another big one over there.

40
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,815
Fixated but keeping his distance.

41
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,127
Strikes me as the shy type.

42
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:56,051
And then there are these chumps.

43
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,053
Dirty bastards.

44
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,715
They had the foresight to suit up in full gear.

45
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,193
'Course Reiner took yours.

46
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:08,603
Point is, changing into a Titan isn't
gonna accomplish very much right now.

47
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,609
One, they can do the same thing if they want.

48
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:14,148
Two, they can zip into the trees if not.

49
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:17,682
Three, we're basically surrounded on all sides.

50
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:22,855
Power or no power, getting out of this would
be tricky as hell, even at the best of times.

51
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,802
Y'read me?

52
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:28,791
There's nothing to gain by being a dumbass.

53
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,380
She's right.

54
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,717
Y'can't turn into Titans right now anyway.

55
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:36,696
Don't count on that ability coming to the rescue.

56
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,612
The body can only take so much.

57
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,536
It's a little preoccupied with healing at the moment.

58
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:49,471
Nice try. You expect me to sit
here and take the word of liar?

59
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,471
Yeah, well. We're sort of at a disadvantage here.

60
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:59,425
It's not like we know the ins and outs of how this works.

61
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,398
Unlike you guys, I'm basically
clueless about the whole thing.

62
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:05,701
Hey, Reiner.

63
00:06:06,353 --> 00:06:08,957
You said you'd start talking once Eren was up.

64
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:13,891
Don't'cha think it's about time somebody
explains what you plan on doing with us?

65
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:18,061
We're taking you to our hometown.

66
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,028
Of course, I realize neither
of you is just gonna do as I ask.

67
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,300
Like Ymir was saying, though,

68
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:29,192
this place is crawling with Titans. They're everywhere.

69
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:33,936
We could beat the living shit out
of each other if that's what you want.

70
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:36,493
But I wouldn't recommend it.

71
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:40,626
Our friends down below are hungry
and not prone to discriminate.

72
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:43,350
Whether you try to cut and run or stick around,

73
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,964
believe me when I say our options are limited.

74
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,404
We wait for nightfall.

75
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:53,448
So, why didn't you just stay in
Titan form and run all the way home?

76
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,109
What's the point of stopping here in the first place?

77
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,573
You get winded and have to take a break?

78
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,907
Why don't you use your imagination?

79
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,984
Let me think. Suppose I wait for an opening.

80
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:15,226
If I assume Titan form, running away
wouldn't really be that much of a challenge.

81
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:20,675
Question is, can I assume Titan form in this condition?

82
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:24,123
Reiner doesn't seem to think so,

83
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:28,748
and it's not like he and Bertholdt would
risk stopping here without a good reason.

84
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,529
What if I couldn't transform to full strength?

85
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,020
Does that mean the other Titans would be able to eat me?

86
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,937
So we're just gonna sit on our
asses till the sun goes down?

87
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,383
It's a possibility.

88
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:46,609
No. Why give us the chance to recover?

89
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:50,152
If they wait for nightfall we'd only be harder to rein in.

90
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:54,165
They'll make their move while we're still helpless.

91
00:07:56,382 --> 00:08:00,606
At this rate I can't do anything. We're screwed.

92
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:05,547
What happened to everyone else?

93
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,638
Where are the Scouts?

94
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,364
Don't tell me they're coming here to save us.

95
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,186
Oh god. If they show up, none of 'em will...

96
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,196
Wait a second.

97
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,510
Those Titans at the castle had
no problem moving around at night.

98
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,629
What's stopping these guys?

99
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,672
The Titans here can't move after dark.

100
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:29,732
But then you know all about that, don't you, Ymir?

101
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,026
How is it she's able to transform into a Titan?

102
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:40,324
Doesn't seem to catch her off-guard like it did me.

103
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,572
What's her angle?

104
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,947
Who's side is she on in all this?

105
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:47,912
If I thought she was hard to read before...

106
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:54,837
I've made up my mind. I need information.

107
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:56,402
Anything I can get.

108
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,938
Keep my eyes and ears open.

109
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,989
When the moment comes, make a break for it.

110
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,287
Before I can do that, though...

111
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,982
I have to keep my emotions in check.

112
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,802
Give myself a chance to recuperate.

113
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:27,294
Titan spotted at three o'clock! Use the flare!

114
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,535
We've got a smoke shell fired from the right wing!

115
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:35,637
We stay the course! Tell the right wing to
merge with the center and maintain direction!

116
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,822
The shortest path is our only option.

117
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:40,491
Straight ahead. We have until sundown!

118
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:48,014
Mikasa. Hey, Mikasa. Hello?

119
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,881
Stop pushing so hard.

120
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,328
You're drifting up into the vanguard.

121
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:55,530
You wanna break the whole formation?

122
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:59,203
Look, I know how you feel. But what'd I tell ya?

123
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:02,680
Eren's not gonna let those assholes
get the best of him without a fight.

124
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:03,745
Agreed?

125
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,097
Mm.

126
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:08,814
Kid just doesn't have it in him to give up.

127
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,951
All we gotta do is have a little faith.

128
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,209
He'll hold his own till the rest of us get there.

129
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:18,906
Always has, always will.

130
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,149
Hey, Reiner. Got any water?

131
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,422
Help a girl out. I'm dying over here.

132
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,909
Sorry, there's not a helluva a lot I can do.

133
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:54,372
Even if it is a matter of life and death.

134
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,148
That's comforting. Well, at least
now we know where we stand. Sort of.

135
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,169
Speaking of which. We've been working

136
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,476
our asses off. No food, no sleep, no nothing.

137
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,321
Ever since those Titans showed up.

138
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,775
That was yesterday, right?

139
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:17,296
Man, we're lucky the wall hasn't been destroyed.

140
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:21,212
Still, you'd think that means they'd give us a break.

141
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,891
And don't even get me started on promotion.

142
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,894
What the hell?

143
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:32,025
What? Aww, come on. I don't think
that's too much to ask, do you?

144
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:35,228
God knows we've done our share of heavy lifting

145
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,537
all things considered.

146
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:40,493
I mean, I get it, we're soldiers. Duty first.

147
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,219
It's just nice to be acknowledged.

148
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,335
You bang your head or something?

149
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,633
What're you even talking about. Seriously?

150
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,520
Ugh. Don't give me that.

151
00:11:57,643 --> 00:12:01,068
I'm not sayin' we storm in and
demand the rank of captain or anything.

152
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,466
No. That's not what I mean.

153
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:07,629
Oh, yeah. Where'd you find that cannon, by the way?

154
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,053
I owe you one for saving my bacon.

155
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,672
Really nice of Christa to patch me up afterwards.

156
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,443
I'm starting to think me and her might become a thing.

157
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:19,135
Hey.

158
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:21,224
Right? It's not just me?

159
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,646
She always treats me like we're...

160
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:23,751
Hey!

161
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:31,314
What's wrong with you? You've got to be kidding me.

162
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,129
Huh? What're you so pissed about all of a sudden?

163
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,092
Take it easy, man. Was it something I said, or?

164
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,832
If you wanna die, then just keep talking!

165
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,246
Hold up, Eren.

166
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,735
I think somebody's gone off the deep end.

167
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,778
Is that what this is, Bertholdt?

168
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,552
If you know something we don't,

169
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:56,110
now would be a good time to put it on the table.

170
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,126
Huh?

171
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,164
Reiner. Snap out of it.

172
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:05,611
You're not a soldier, okay?

173
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,538
You and I are... We're warriors.

174
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:23,529
Reiner! What are you doing?

175
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,965
Hey. Why...?

176
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:39,004
Why is Marco... being devoured?

177
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,898
Right. I see. That's how things are.

178
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,823
What the hell's he doing?

179
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:07,822
I have a pretty good idea. At least I think so.

180
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:10,467
Didn't add up at first.

181
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:14,488
Why would the man who broke the
wall risk his neck to save Conny?

182
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:19,644
It's like the poor bastard's
personality is compartmentalized.

183
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:22,820
Everything he does is a contradiction in terms.

184
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,148
He can't help it.

185
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:28,462
On one hand, he's a warrior bent
on pushing mankind past the brink.

186
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,988
On the other he's pretending to be a soldier.

187
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:34,307
I'm thinking maybe he got a little lost in the role.

188
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:39,226
See. He can't resolve those facets of himself.

189
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,251
Can't bear the weight of what he's done.

190
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:45,375
The only way for him to manage his
conscience is to fall for his own act.

191
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,776
He thinks he is a soldier.

192
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:52,391
This is what you call a split personality.

193
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:53,900
He's gone insane.

194
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:58,437
His heart and mind are at war with each
other, and judging by Bertholdt's expression,

195
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:00,955
this isn't the first stalemate.

196
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,721
Blows me away!

197
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,741
Wow, someone as brutally honest
as you losing their grip...

198
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,664
Shut up!

199
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,751
Not another word.

200
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,878
I'm sorry. Must've really hit a nerve.

201
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:24,266
Is this some kind of joke?

202
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:28,690
Where do you get off pretending to be the victim?

203
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,864
You're wallowing in self-pity?

204
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:37,585
How dare you. What was going through
your head the day I told you my story, huh?

205
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,898
Remember that, Bertholdt?

206
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:42,741
I'm talking to you, lackey!

207
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,616
I told you everything.

208
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,529
You sat there and looked me straight in the eye.

209
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,464
Watched me relive seeing my mother eaten alive.

210
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,602
Stop it! No!

211
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,475
Don't you remember?

212
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,688
Well, it just so happens the chunk of
wall you kicked out fell on our house.

213
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:03,453
It's what kept her from being able to run away.

214
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,077
Ring any bells? Take you back?

215
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:10,868
Let me ask you again.

216
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:15,729
What was going through your
head when I told you that story?

217
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,574
Want me to be honest?

218
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,872
In the moment I felt... sorry for you.

219
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:35,183
Huh. Sorry for me?

220
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:39,713
So, then. You're not...

221
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:45,719
You're not warriors or soldiers. You're just murderers.

222
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:51,606
Psychotic mass-murderers who snuffed out the lives
of countless people that never did you any wrong.

223
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,409
Don't you think I'm aware of that fact?

224
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:56,008
I don't need you shoving it down my goddamn throat!

225
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,551
Then stop acting like you've got
any right to feel sorry for yourself!

226
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:02,037
We're living in a hell you two created!

227
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:03,499
Are you proud of yourselves?

228
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,367
You're not one of us! You've never been!

229
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,259
You're not even human anymore!

230
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:08,307
You want an apology?

231
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:10,739
Is that what you hope to get out of calling us murderers?

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,788
Want us to feel bad? Want us to take the blame?

233
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,107
Who are you talking to?

234
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:17,442
The people you thought you knew don't exist!

235
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:20,359
They're dead! But hey, if screaming does it for ya,

236
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:23,051
go ahead and scream your goddamn head off!

237
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,449
You're right.

238
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:42,167
Who am I? What do I know?

239
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:50,667
Still. I've got to do something. Anything.

240
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:55,855
I swear to you, one way or
another, the two of you will pay.

241
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,430
And it's gonna hurt.

242
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,496
You can't be for real.

243
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:10,014
Huh?

244
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:16,338
Eren, grow up. Keep spouting off childish
bullshit like that and I've got no hope for you.

245
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:22,964
Tell me something.

246
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,651
What's with the giant monkey?

247
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,031
Monkey? What're you talking about?

248
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,469
Huh. I thought for sure you'd know.

249
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,301
That's surprising.

250
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:43,971
From the way you guys were ogling it all slack-jawed
I figured we were seeing some kind of living legend.

251
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:45,264
Weird.

252
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,064
A monkey? Don't be cute.

253
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:56,739
Shut up and listen. Monkey, Beast Titan. Whatever
you wanna call him, he's behind this latest fiasco.

254
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,623
It's why Titans are cropping up out of nowhere.

255
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,404
I get the feeling he's gauging our strength.

256
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,148
Reiner and Betholdt are trying to get wherever he is.

257
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,205
It's how they're getting back home.

258
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,883
Feel free to correct me if I'm way off base.

259
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:17,730
Wait. How did you know? Who are you?

260
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:19,335
What else haven't you told me?

261
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:22,743
Be patient. I'm caught up in circumstances of my own.

262
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,697
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

263
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:31,331
Eren. If you think killing these morons will
put an end to all of this, you are sorely mistaken.

264
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,404
Huh? But then who's the enemy?

265
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:35,739
The enemy?

266
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,749
Look, if I told you, things would get too...

267
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,597
Ymir! There's no future for this world and you know it.

268
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:45,140
You have a solid grasp of things.

269
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:46,610
What d'you think comes next?

270
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:50,566
Joining our side wouldn't be out of
the question if you were so inclined.

271
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:54,094
And put my faith in you guys? That's rich.

272
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,517
Neither of you trusts me as far as you can throw me.

273
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:58,647
Come on. That isn't true.

274
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:01,405
We know what you really want.

275
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,471
All you care about is protecting Christa.

276
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:10,421
If we can all agree on that, I don't see the conflict.

277
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,948
I'm being absolutely serious.

278
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,817
Is it so hard to believe we want what's best for her, too?

279
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,312
Hate to break it to ya, but you're not the only one.

280
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,895
Then again, you could always put your trust in Eren,

281
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,428
see where that leads you.

282
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,223
What?

283
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,832
You're probably leaning toward escape.

284
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:35,129
Better to take a chance with
him than throw in with us, right?

285
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,370
Because if we end up taking you,

286
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:39,547
there's not much hope of being rescued.

287
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,114
I'll be straight with you. That much is true.

288
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:47,564
Even if you came willingly, we're not
in a position to guarantee your safety.

289
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,599
But if it's Christa we're talking about,

290
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,434
we might be able to do something.

291
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:58,090
It's your call. What's it gonna be?

292
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:03,055
Is it Christa's future? Or your own petty existence?

293
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,829
Is there really no future for this world?

294
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,509
Why? And the monkey.

295
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:11,493
How does he figure into this?

296
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,729
Come clean! Who's the real enemy?

297
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:17,452
Tell me what you know!

298
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,281
Who is it?!

299
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,171
Couldn't say.

300
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:33,313
All right, then. Sorry, Eren.

301
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,341
The Scouts are here? Already?

302
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:51,285
Son of a bitch!

303
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:55,375
No. Damn you, Ymir!

304
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:02,032
Only one hour left until sunset.

305
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,678
Night approaches swiftly.

306
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:50,053
The Scouts close in, intent on
rescuing Eren from Reiner and Bertholdt.

307
00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:54,270
The traitorous pair attempts a bold escape

308
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,249
using their ODM gear.

309
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,428
Conflicted, reflecting on her dark and bloodied past,

310
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:04,206
Ymir offers an alternative.

311
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:09,714
Next episode: "Children."
