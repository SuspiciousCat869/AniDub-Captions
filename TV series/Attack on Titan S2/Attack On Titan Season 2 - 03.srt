1
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:12,919
Conny! Have you found any survivors?

2
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:14,945
No.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,460
No. It's-it's in ruins.

4
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:24,478
My hometown has been completely wiped out!

5
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:34,035
Hey. Something's wrong.

6
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,532
You find any bodies?

7
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,390
No.

8
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:42,234
No, not yet.

9
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,161
How is that even possible?

10
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:46,726
Titans ransack this place and
there's not a speck of blood?

11
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,934
They must've fled.

12
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:50,047
The villagers, I mean, they all escaped.

13
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:51,795
Uh, your family, too.

14
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,695
You think so? You think they're alive?

15
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:57,467
Um. Yeah, sure!

16
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,336
It's the only logical explanation for
why there'd be no trace of well, carnage.

17
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:04,141
I don't know that I agree with that.

18
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:08,415
Suppose the entire village <i>was</i> evacuated in time.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,379
How do you explain the devastation?

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,764
Why would Titans rip apart empty houses?

21
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,967
And that doesn't bother me half
as much as the stables being full.

22
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:26,053
Without horses, the villagers'
odds of survival are slim to none.

23
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:28,914
Anyone not have a torch?

24
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,749
Okay. Let's move!

25
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,966
Our mission is to evaluate the breach!

26
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:34,688
Sir!

27
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:48,370
Wuh. Welcome home.

28
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,929
Huh? Did I...?

29
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,508
Snap out of it!

30
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,891
We're falling behind Gelgar and the others!

31
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:12,686
D'you hear that? You had to!

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,062
I swear that Titan...

33
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,590
It was only your imagination.

34
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:19,607
I didn't hear a damn thing. Focus on the mission.

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,841
But, I... It sounded...

36
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:23,614
I don't know how, but...

37
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,519
It sounded, like my mother.

38
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:30,240
Dammit, Conny! Do you even know how
serious our situation is right now?

39
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,729
If we don't see this through, people
will die in the hundreds of thousands!

40
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:39,242
Just 'cause your family escaped
doesn't mean they're out of the woods yet!

41
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:42,156
Now, you wanna be a soldier or don't you?

42
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:48,997
Yeah. Stay focused.

43
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,636
I'm a soldier!

44
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,369
The closer we get to the wall,

45
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,466
the less populated the area will be.

46
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:45,231
That's good. It didn't take us very long.

47
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:49,735
All right. Let's head to the south.

48
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,287
What's the point?

49
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:55,362
Last I heard there aren't any
villages to the south of here.

50
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,872
We've raised the alarm for everyone in the region.

51
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,368
Now we pinpoint the breach.

52
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:02,227
The idea is to ride along the
wall from the west 'til we do.

53
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:06,536
Seriously? You know Christa and me
don't have our battle gear, right?

54
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,478
What're we supposed to do about Titans?

55
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:09,980
The south will be crawlin' with 'em.

56
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:13,443
If we can't defend ourselves, you
ought'a just serve us up on a platter.

57
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,527
Why not let the two of us withdraw from the front?

58
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,436
Ymir!

59
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,897
Negative. When we find where they're
coming in, I'll need someone to relay it HQ.

60
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:26,655
I know you're scared, but like
it or not, that's part of the job.

61
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:36,873
Ymir. Look, I'm aware of what I've gotten myself into.

62
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:42,655
Come on. Hey, no one made me
join the Scouts, and you know it!

63
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:46,199
I... I chose it for myself.

64
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,139
I know it's a different story in your case...

65
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:53,318
What? Y'think I signed up for
all this crap because of you?

66
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,913
What other reason do you have for being here?

67
00:05:56,282 --> 00:06:00,248
You tried talking me into joining the
Military Police 'til you were blue in the face.

68
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,885
You bowed out so I'd be eligible!

69
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,086
Don't try to deny it.

70
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,684
I wasn't good enough to make the top ten on my own.

71
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:12,610
Ask anybody. When it comes to skill,
you're the better soldier by far.

72
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,488
I have no idea how you did it, but...

73
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,976
Why? Why do that for me?

74
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,592
My family?

75
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,621
That's it, isn't it?

76
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:35,006
Sure. Why not?

77
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:40,566
Relax. Don't worry about it so much.

78
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,267
Take my word for it, sweetie.

79
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,802
I'm only lookin' out for number one.

80
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:48,941
Really?

81
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,116
That's such a relief.

82
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,601
Steady! The target is in range!

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,857
All cannons, prepare to fire!

84
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:16,757
Ready. Aim.

85
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,675
Fire!

86
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,738
That do the trick?

87
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,127
Nice one, Captain Rico!

88
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:47,648
We keep this up they'll never break our defense!

89
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,102
Not necessarily.

90
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,422
The enemy has strength in numbers.

91
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:56,839
If they attack en masse, the line
won't have a snowball's chance in hell.

92
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:01,973
And worse, something's off. Really off.

93
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,117
I don't like this.

94
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:07,581
Captain Hannes, sir. What's wrong?

95
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:11,465
Anyone else bothered by the fact
we haven't spotted a Titan yet?

96
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,080
You'd think the hole would've jumped out at us by now.

97
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:19,172
If where they're getting in is nearby, why's it so quiet?

98
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:23,477
Not that I mind on principle.

99
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:27,266
We find the damn thing and get
back without a scrape, all the better.

100
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:53,088
Please. Just get it over with.

101
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:56,193
I can't take this.

102
00:08:57,441 --> 00:09:00,118
Any second now they'll lunge at us from the shadows.

103
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,576
Dammit. The closer we get to the entry point,

104
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:09,867
the more it feels like we're
marching into the jaws of death.

105
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:15,417
Ugh! This is driving me out of my mind!

106
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:43,566
So, you followed the wall here too, I take it?

107
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,526
That's right. I assume you found the breach then?

108
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:47,678
Huh?

109
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,555
We didn't see any irregularities along the western route.

110
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,511
Surely you must've seen something in the east?

111
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:59,063
No. The wall's perfectly intact.

112
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:08,042
Well, maybe we just overlooked it?

113
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:12,141
Not likely. Hole big enough
for Titans to get through? No way.

114
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,944
I suggest we have another pass, then.

115
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,901
That goes without saying.

116
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:20,443
Trouble is, the horses are on
the verge of collapse and so are we.

117
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:23,780
If only we had more light.

118
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:26,640
Huh?

119
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:30,581
What's that?

120
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,168
An old castle?

121
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,895
Not an ideal place to sleep,

122
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,389
but I guess we can make do with it for one night.

123
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,426
Yeah. And the moon's finally out, at least.

124
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,912
Hey, Four-Eyes.

125
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,258
Since when are you a geologist?

126
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:20,539
Or are rocks just that fascinating?

127
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,517
Looks like you're about to drool.

128
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,490
What, this? It's not a rock.

129
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:27,785
Not an ordinary one, anyway.

130
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,448
It's a hardened piece of skin
left behind by the Female Titan.

131
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,664
It didn't vanish?

132
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,392
No. This random fragment broke off when
Annie reverted back to her human form.

133
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,799
It didn't evaporate. Didn't simply go "poof."

134
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:44,661
So that got me thinking.

135
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,860
And when I compared it with a sliver of the wall,

136
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,618
its texture and composition were, for all
intents and purposes, virtually identical.

137
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:55,837
In laymen's terms we're hemmed in
by a barricade of enormous Titans.

138
00:11:55,924 --> 00:12:00,478
If my hypothesis is correct, the surface
was constructed using consolidated Titan skin.

139
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:02,575
You're kidding me.

140
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:04,418
That's what Armin was trying to say.

141
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,072
So, then...!

142
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,820
Easy. It's rude to steal someone else's thunder.

143
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:15,333
As it stands, we'd be hard-pressed to
find a rock big enough to plug Wall Rose.

144
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,083
It'd have to be just the right shape
and size, and we don't have specifics yet.

145
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:21,791
But, on the other hand,

146
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:23,858
where there's a will there's a way.

147
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:28,696
Picture Eren utilizing his
hardening ability while in Titan form.

148
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:34,615
I could... patch the hole.

149
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,977
The sealant should be composed of the same material.

150
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,956
And the hardened bit won't
dissolve once you've transformed back.

151
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,562
This might be less of a long shot than it sounds.

152
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,071
Thoughts?

153
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,945
Well, anything worthwhile incurs a little risk.

154
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:55,940
If we can manage to shore up Wall Rose,

155
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,921
Wall Maria starts to look fairly promising.

156
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:04,440
Vital as it is, the outpost
infrastructure slows us down to a crawl.

157
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:08,262
The time and resources needed to
transport materials are immense.

158
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:14,752
But, if supply wagons don't have to be accommodated,
we can make our way to Shiganshina much faster.

159
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:18,622
And what if we decided to carry
out our plan in the dead of night?

160
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:19,524
Night?

161
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,337
Yes.

162
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,819
When the Titans are effectively motionless.

163
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,651
That's not bad. In fact it's genius.

164
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:29,842
Particularly if the group is
small enough to slip by undetected.

165
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,348
The straits we're in are as dire as they come.

166
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,788
But there might just be the teeniest bit of slack.

167
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,811
Yeah. Just bear in mind, though,

168
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,643
the whole plan hinges on whether
or not Eren can seal a hole, again.

169
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,728
It's, uh, probably unfair of me to even ask.

170
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,984
But do you think you can?

171
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,236
What he thinks really isn't the issue.

172
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,707
You either will, or you won't.

173
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:10,020
That's the reality.

174
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,686
Our comrades are breaking their backs,

175
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:15,065
but without you, it's nothing.

176
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:17,559
Failure isn't an option.

177
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,800
Sir! I know!

178
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,063
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes!

179
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:24,830
That's a promise.

180
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,514
My father's cellar. That's where the answers are.

181
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:38,327
If there's a grain of truth in what he told me,

182
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,370
everything depends on us making it there.

183
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:50,808
Here's Ehrmich.

184
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:08,772
No one said stop. A rolling stone gathers no moss.

185
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:10,829
This is...

186
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:14,048
Maybe you expected to see something quaint?

187
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,598
This is what happens when the walls give.

188
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:23,078
Mommy! Daddy!

189
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:28,443
No. Take it in, holy man.

190
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:33,035
These are the faces of human beings
who've lost everything they ever had.

191
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,666
Human beings you and your kind abandoned, incidentally.

192
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,066
Hard to look at it, I'd imagine.

193
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:43,237
But if the church had its way, this'd be all of us.

194
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,677
Titans would pour in and make a feast of what's left.

195
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:50,275
Shoveling man, woman, and child
down their putrescent gullets.

196
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:53,104
All humanity digested as one.

197
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,333
Once we leave Ehrmich,

198
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:00,367
we'll be in Titan territory proper.

199
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,464
Eren. Well enough to ride a horse yet?

200
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:06,686
Yeah, should be able to manage
one without much of a hassle.

201
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,035
Saddle up then, soldier. There's a
mount waiting for you on the left lift.

202
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:10,789
Right.

203
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,986
Section Commander, we're pressed for time.

204
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:18,482
Oh. Thanks, Moblit. Give me a sec.

205
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:22,588
So? Seen the light yet, by any chance?

206
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh, goddamn it! Make up your mind!

207
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:33,688
This isn't some spiritual test! Lives are on the line!

208
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:36,962
Alas, I have no choice.

209
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,513
Neither myself nor the others who
believe are at liberty to divulge the truth.

210
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,240
Fat lot a help you are!

211
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,496
Thanks for keeping us company! It's been fun!

212
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,478
I'd offer my help if I could,

213
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,366
but a duty as great as this one is beyond me.

214
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:58,610
The Order of the Walls abides by the
sacred will our faith commands us to obey.

215
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,587
Whose "sacred will"?

216
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,653
You mean like, God or something?

217
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:04,292
I can't answer that.

218
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,342
But what I can do is provide you with a name.

219
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:12,998
An individual the sacred will in its
divine wisdom instructed us to monitor.

220
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,484
Monitor?

221
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,893
It's a person you know.

222
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,729
Someone who enlisted with the
Scout Regiment as of this year.

223
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,353
A child by the name of...

224
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,721
Important message!

225
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,024
I'm with the 104th Cadet Corps!

226
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,977
Oh, and my name is Sasha Braus!

227
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:33,718
No way.

228
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:35,353
Who?

229
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,350
Sorry. This is for you, Section Commander.

230
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:42,195
You must find her with all haste. She is the key.

231
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:45,580
She may know things we understand but poorly.

232
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,249
And with that, we come to the
end of what I'm free to share.

233
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,468
The rest I leave in your capable hands.

234
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:57,966
But if-if she's in the 104th Cadet
Corps, she's at the front lines by now!

235
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:01,074
Then let's go! Come on! There's no time to lose!

236
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:02,923
Watch where you're going!

237
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:05,108
Sasha?

238
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,777
Just where did you come from all of a sudden?

239
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:13,809
I was sent to give a message to Commander Erwin.

240
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:17,384
Who, then, entrusted me to deliver
this to you, Section Commander!

241
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,938
Oh, uh. Okay, then. Excellent work.

242
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,569
So, who is Nick talking about?

243
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,106
She was the smallest one in our class.

244
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:32,377
Golden hair. Blue eyes.

245
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:36,810
In fact, she's uh... kinda cute.

246
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:40,720
The girl who's always hanging around Ymir.

247
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,301
Excuse me?

248
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,282
How can you read this?

249
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:53,921
Ymir. Do you?

250
00:18:56,264 --> 00:19:00,134
Everyone, wake up! Get to the tower immediately!

251
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,828
I couldn't see them in the dark,

252
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:12,481
but with the moonlight...

253
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,687
How can they move? This shouldn't be happening!

254
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,990
The sun went down hours ago!

255
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,455
Wh-What's going on?

256
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,186
Hey, guys. The hell is that?

257
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,936
It's gotta be a Titan,

258
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:31,152
but have you ever seen one that big?

259
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:35,801
Look at it! It's more like, some kind of beast.

260
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:37,444
How do we...?

261
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,625
Wait, is it? It's headed for the wall!

262
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,175
That's the plan. Are we clear?

263
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,113
Yes, clear!

264
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,750
Right. We have to go! Now!

265
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:57,982
Calm down, Eren.

266
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:01,359
I need you all to listen.

267
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,417
We're going our separate ways. That's how it has to be.

268
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:11,741
Erwin had his reasons for throwing this ragtag
squad together, but right now this is all riding on you.

269
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,251
Armin, you and Hange are the brain trust.

270
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,080
Use your combined knowledge to
cook up some kind of solution.

271
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:18,645
Right. Yes, sir!

272
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:24,103
Mikasa. I don't think I'll ever get
why you're so attached to the guy, but,

273
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:28,131
put your skills to good use. Protect Eren at all costs.

274
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,371
Sir! I intend to!

275
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,065
And you.

276
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,328
Don't screw this up.

277
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:42,423
Hey, hey! Back off! Don't be coming up here!

278
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,318
Ain't'cha got nothin' better to do?

279
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,121
Bother someone else.

280
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,482
I should be drinking right now, damn it!

281
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:53,270
You're standing between me and a tankard of ale!

282
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:55,653
I've earned the right to get trashed!

283
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:58,156
Rookies! Stay where you are!

284
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,903
We've got this.

285
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,637
Let the ODM gear do what it was designed for.

286
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:08,951
Attack!

287
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:26,595
Check your emotions, Eren.

288
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,528
Learn the meaning of the word restraint.

289
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:33,659
If you let yourself succumb
to blind rage, all hope is lost.

290
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:36,320
We can't afford another mistake.

291
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:37,693
Sir!

292
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:43,467
There's a tower nearby that'll give us access to the wall.

293
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:46,962
Part of an abandoned fortification to the southwest.

294
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,083
We ride with all haste for Utgard Castle!

295
00:23:42,677 --> 00:23:46,393
While searching the area for a
presumed weak spot in Wall Rose,

296
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:49,197
the Scouts have stumbled upon Utgard Castle.

297
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:55,154
The stillness is broken by a Titan horde
inexplicably able to move under the cover of darkness.

298
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,237
The Scouts fight valiantly.

299
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:03,209
But as the enemy bears down on their
increasingly precarious position within the ruins,

300
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,910
Reiner's past comes back to haunt him.

301
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,666
Next episode: "Soldier."
