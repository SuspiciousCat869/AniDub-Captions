1
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:17,131
Me? Only thing I want is to go back home.

2
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,014
That's all I care about now.

3
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:25,496
I joined the ranks hoping for
assignment to the Military Police.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,420
Tucked away in the Interior.

5
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:31,250
What about you? Why did you sign up?

6
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:34,993
Why'd I join?

7
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:37,844
I decided I have to kill them.

8
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,268
I won't stop till every single Titan is dead and rotting.

9
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:45,199
Dead. Every last one.

10
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,371
You saw what those monsters are capable of.

11
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:04,395
And you still want to take them on?

12
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:09,083
I know you've got what it takes.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,085
I can see it in you. Am I wrong here?

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,154
Damn you! You traitors!

15
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,054
Eren!

16
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:31,460
What's wrong with me?

17
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,949
Why didn't I slice their goddamn heads off?

18
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:37,841
That was the perfect chance.

19
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:40,940
Why did I hesitate? Why?

20
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:47,311
That was it.

21
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,735
There won't be another opportunity.

22
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:00,166
Move! Everyone!

23
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,288
It's got Ymir!

24
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,843
Oh, hell! She's not the only one!

25
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,171
Shit!

26
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:22,843
No. This isn't happening!

27
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,736
How can Bertholdt...?

28
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:39,924
Soldiers! Prepare to attack!

29
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,681
The Colossal Titan doesn't walk away from this!

30
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,890
It's a threat to all mankind!

31
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,876
Swarm and terminate!

32
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,696
Freak's as slow as they say.

33
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:14,477
Size is all he has going for him.

34
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,742
Compared to Titans we're usually up
against, this one's a piece of cake!

35
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:19,529
Simple!

36
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:23,103
He's wide open! Slice the nape!

37
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,880
What the hell?

38
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,443
It's too hot!

39
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,320
Argh! All of you fall back!

40
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,004
My hand!

41
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,965
Water! We need water!

42
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,326
He's vanishing!

43
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:48,321
I don't know. Something's different here.

44
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,315
The last time he disappeared,

45
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,683
it was more or less instantaneous.

46
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:56,060
He's maintaining his form to emit heat.

47
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,340
I think he's protecting himself.

48
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,062
As long as he generates steam our rigs are useless!

49
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,302
What-What do we do?

50
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:10,677
Now? Nothing. Except wait.

51
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:14,850
Squads three and four take position behind the target.

52
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,424
Rashad has command.

53
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,059
Got it!

54
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,865
Squad two, stay put. Lauda has command.

55
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,700
Understood!

56
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:26,332
How long he can act like a
blast furnace remains to be seen.

57
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,310
But he'll come out of there eventually.

58
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,352
When he does, we'll rush the big bastard.

59
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,211
Listen up.

60
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:35,477
I want you to forget about taking them alive.

61
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:38,082
Destroy them. No second thoughts.

62
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:42,689
You're with me.

63
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,155
Right, squad one, look alive!

64
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,401
We've got a date with the Armored Titan!

65
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:52,201
Christa! Conny! Move further back!

66
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:55,957
For now, just take care of those two.

67
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,562
Ymir, she...

68
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:01,732
She's not dead. It just isn't possible.

69
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,998
I know it. Please save her!

70
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,619
Don't worry.

71
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,948
Hang on! What about Reiner and Bertholdt?

72
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:14,063
They're screwed! Neither one of them has their ODM gear!

73
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:17,398
I'm begging you, wherever they are, bring them back!

74
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:52,363
Reiner. You lying piece of shit.

75
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,838
Going off on what it means to be a soldier.

76
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,683
Always talking about honor.

77
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,827
Played us all for fools, huh?

78
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:06,015
Combat training must've been a joke to you.

79
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:08,947
How much were you holding back?

80
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:15,207
And here I took you to be real stand-up guy.

81
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:18,877
Calm under pressure. Intensely focused.

82
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:22,772
The sort of man who puts his comrades before himself.

83
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:30,287
Damn you. I'd have given anything in
the world to be half as strong as you.

84
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,552
You were my hero.

85
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:39,289
That did nothing!

86
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,826
He barely flinched when Eren hit him.

87
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:49,067
And my blades don't even make a dent.

88
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:55,963
He's not like Annie. His armor's head to toe!

89
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,179
Eren!

90
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,456
Hey, Reiner. Asshole.

91
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,738
I don't know what kind of face you're making right now...

92
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:22,984
...but I hope you miserable pieces
of shit are pleased with yourselves.

93
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:31,057
I bet I could scour through the history of
mankind and not find anyone a fraction as evil.

94
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,589
You should be erased.

95
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,988
Trash like you can't be allowed to exist.

96
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:46,105
What was going through your head?

97
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,164
You disgust me!

98
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:53,143
Just thinking about your face makes my insides churn!

99
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:56,497
You make me want to puke!

100
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:02,247
You're a pest! A revolting, oversized pest!

101
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:06,943
And pests have to be exterminated!

102
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,023
Hey, take it easy! That hurt!

103
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:32,678
We're just sparring.

104
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:34,291
You're supposed to hold back a little.

105
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:36,198
If you want to hold back, that's your business.

106
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:40,580
I defend myself assuming you're coming at me with
everything you've got. Otherwise, what's the point?

107
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,586
Let's remember I'm the girl. I'm weaker.

108
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:47,869
I have to protect my frail
little body from the big bad man.

109
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,443
What? Ha-ha, Annie.

110
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,095
Very funny. You're a riot.

111
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:55,877
Frail little nothin'. I'm the one who
just got shoved in the dirt, you know.

112
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:57,688
Good point.

113
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,068
That last move wasn't about who's stronger, okay?

114
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,642
I was using a special defense technique.

115
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,765
Comes in handy when your opponent has a few pounds on you.

116
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,402
Trust me. You could benefit from learning it.

117
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,429
Sure, uh...

118
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:17,940
What do you say we take a break for now, though?

119
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,814
Right. That's enough, Annie. You can let go.

120
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:38,222
Come on. I've barely shown you how this
works and already you're surrendering?

121
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:40,124
There's a two-fold benefit here.

122
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,308
Or don't you want to learn how to talk to women?

123
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,160
Fine! Whatever! Just please stop strangling me!

124
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:49,091
Ah. So you are interested in what I can show you.

125
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,421
Not really sure I wanna know how you got here.

126
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,018
Hey, Annie.

127
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,878
Your technique seems pretty solid.

128
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:07,444
Teach me.

129
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,323
I'm flattered, but...

130
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,826
...it's a method for normal people.

131
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,868
So, why would <i>you</i> ever need it?

132
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,627
Still, I'm curious to know if it works on animals.

133
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:25,868
Let's find out.

134
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,212
This is happening? Oh crap.

135
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:33,026
Hold up! Are these two actually about to fight?

136
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,026
This is gonna be epic!

137
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,189
...Who...? Who do we bet on? ...What d'you mean? Annie.

138
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,705
What? Idiot!

139
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,834
Dinner says Mikasa wipes the floor with 'er!

140
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,901
Which one of 'em <i>you</i> think's gonna win?

141
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:44,681
Well, I...

142
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,339
How should I know?

143
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:03,106
Wait. How did that play out?

144
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:06,617
And why's it coming to me now?

145
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:11,176
Is this...? Is this my life flashing before my eyes?

146
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,565
So what? Who gives a shit?

147
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:20,982
It's not like it matters. Not when I feel like this.

148
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,087
No! Back down!

149
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:25,160
You can't win in a fistfight!

150
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,075
Make a break for the wall!

151
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,936
Eren, please! Don't be rash!

152
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,391
Eren!

153
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:41,790
Oh, no!

154
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,800
He's blinded by rage!

155
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:07,737
What the hell is he doing?

156
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:10,397
Wait, that... Holy crap!

157
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,455
That's Annie's technique!

158
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,314
You know what?

159
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,780
There's no telling what you murdering
hypocrites were trying to accomplish.

160
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:23,794
But now that I think about it, your
master plan seems to have a few holes in it.

161
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,511
Wanna eradicate humanity?

162
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:31,167
Maybe next time don't teach me how to kick your ass!

163
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:36,666
It's working! I've got him locked!

164
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,978
There's still a chance!

165
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,577
I don't think so!

166
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,217
Eren!

167
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,164
You're not going anywhere!

168
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:09,568
He did it!

169
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:21,153
Eren! Can you hear me? Run away!

170
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,108
You've got to get closer to the wall!

171
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,984
They're trying to abduct you!

172
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:26,588
We can't let them do that!

173
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:30,100
Trust me. Escape is our best option!

174
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,763
You say that, but Armin, come on.
They're not just gonna let us leave.

175
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:44,908
Both of you fall back! Now!

176
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,897
Nice one, Eren! Good call!

177
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,970
Looks like he's in control again.

178
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,823
Yeah, but Reiner's not just gonna let him go.

179
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,619
You're right; escape's impossible.

180
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,194
What the hell?

181
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,520
The Colossal Titan. I knew it!

182
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,572
Why'd he show up here of all places?!

183
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,971
What's going on with Eren? Where is he?

184
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,492
Uh. He and the others are over that way!

185
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:03,430
What? So I take it that's his Titan form, huh?

186
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:05,312
Listen up, Eren!

187
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,846
If we're going to get you out of here,

188
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,609
you've got to buy us some time.

189
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,859
Stop Reiner dead in his tracks!

190
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,260
Think you can manage to break off his
leg with another one of those joint holds?

191
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:19,065
Our blades don't do much good against him.

192
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:23,262
He can't be outmuscled, but he can
be outsmarted if you play it right.

193
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,802
Mhmm.

194
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,864
Oooooo!

195
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:36,921
Mikasa! Take my blades.

196
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,424
I want you to use them.

197
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,990
I'm counting on you!

198
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:48,671
This is the one time where
running away guarantees victory.

199
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:52,571
You guys are screwed for letting us see your true colors.

200
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,129
You've backed yourselves into a corner.

201
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:07,366
...What the...?

202
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:08,492
...He's fast!

203
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,030
Shit! The leg! Go for the leg!

204
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,781
Don't let Reiner pin you! Get up!

205
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:22,035
Throw him!

206
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,623
Dammit! There's too much power behind his attack!

207
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,303
Since when is he so light on his feet?

208
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:37,805
We're completely and utterly useless!

209
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:42,676
No. It's not feasible that his body
is as hard as stone from head to toe.

210
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,464
He couldn't move as fast if that were the case.

211
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,244
Warriors used to sheathe themselves in armor.

212
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,209
Way back in the olden days.

213
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,703
They had to leave certain sections
uncovered for freedom of movement, though;

214
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:57,921
like the armpits and groin or the spot behind the knee.

215
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,246
I can't dodge this.

216
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,772
Well, if I'm gonna get slammed...

217
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,640
Bring it!

218
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:11,554
There we go!

219
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:15,494
You're mine, you son of a bitch!

220
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:22,250
Yeah! That's how it's done!

221
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,605
Got him! Now it all boils down to strength!

222
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:32,214
Damn it. I'm slipping!

223
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,915
Mikasa.

224
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:45,195
Nice cut!

225
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:53,976
Try fighting back minus a leg!

226
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:04,009
You've got this!

227
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:08,046
Go for it, Eren! Rip the traitor's head off!

228
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:09,951
Drag him out into the open!

229
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:16,531
I can win. I can beat Reiner.

230
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,812
He's going down!

231
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,223
Wha... What's he...?

232
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,566
Heh. Good luck, pal.

233
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,433
You've got him! Keep it up!

234
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,858
What's he doing?

235
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,161
Why would he stop here?

236
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:10,690
Everyone be on guard! He's calling for backup!

237
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,868
No visual on incoming Titans yet.

238
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:23,021
He ain't got a chance in hell.

239
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:26,586
Try screaming for help without a head, asshole!

240
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,382
It's almost off!

241
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,147
Um, I don't like this.

242
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,697
Had to be some reason for that scream.

243
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:46,497
What the...? No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,752
Above you! Look out!

245
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:46,957
The battle between Eren and the
Armored Titan comes to an abrupt end.

246
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:52,419
Mikasa sustains injury as the Colossal
Titan plummets violently from the wall.

247
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:54,477
Hannes rushes to her side.

248
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,148
From the beginning, through chaos and tragedy,

249
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:01,007
Mikasa and Armin have shared a common goal:

250
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:05,285
to protect Eren and save him from the worst in himself.

251
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:10,444
Next episode: "The Hunters."
