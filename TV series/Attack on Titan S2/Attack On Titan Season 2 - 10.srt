1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,470
The report was right.

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,312
The whole village has been devastated.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,952
But there's not a drop of blood, let alone any bodies.

4
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:16,199
It's eerie. Still, maybe they got out?

5
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:17,574
It's not unheard of.

6
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,440
In theory, I suppose.

7
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:23,763
But then the question becomes why
Titans would smash up empty houses?

8
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:26,035
Bit difficult to believe.

9
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:32,382
What's more, how far were these people
hoping to get by leaving their horses here?

10
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,440
That's a good point.

11
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:36,547
So what do you think happened?

12
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:39,542
Moblit, I found it! Look!

13
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,839
There you are.

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,743
You, uh... you should see this.

15
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:56,597
A portrait of Conny Springer's parents, I presume?

16
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,305
Seems very likely, sir.

17
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,557
It's alive!

18
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,304
No! Stand down!

19
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,321
What the hell is going on?

20
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,657
It's your call. What's it gonna be?

21
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:06,497
Is it Christa's future? Or your own petty existence?

22
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:10,675
Hey! Talk! Who's the real enemy here?

23
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:11,842
Tell me!

24
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:16,158
Couldn't say.

25
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,181
All right, then. Sorry, Eren.

26
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,061
You're kidding.

27
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,993
The Scouts are here? Already?

28
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,426
Son of a bitch!

29
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,079
Talk to me, Reiner. What are you right now?

30
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,232
A warrior. Calm down.

31
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:45,592
Do you really think it's wise for us to trust Ymir?

32
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:48,572
Even though she's the one who devoured Marcel?

33
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,550
Sure. Don't you see?

34
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,798
We have a handle on her motives.

35
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,638
When she turned human again,

36
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:58,918
odds are she just wandered around
aimlessly only giving a damn about herself.

37
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:01,555
But then Christa came into the picture.

38
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:05,250
That's the kind of girl that can change your whole world.

39
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,721
We need her, and not just because she's cute.

40
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:11,367
The people she comes from are an
important family within the church.

41
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,616
Plus, suppose Eren's not the coordinate?

42
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,388
Our job wouldn't be over.

43
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:21,537
If it comes to that, having Christa
around will make the search a lot easier.

44
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,687
They're close.

45
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,308
What are they talking about?

46
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:34,692
They still plan on clearing out before sundown or not?

47
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,418
Please, let's just be done.

48
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,944
The next time we come, we'll take all three.

49
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,361
Annie, Christa, and that. It'll be clean and simple.

50
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:45,744
Then we won't have to come here anymore.

51
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,342
Right. And we'll have completed our damn mission.

52
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,503
Just do me a favor, huh?

53
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,030
Once we're home, try telling Annie how you really feel.

54
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:56,715
What's that supposed to mean?

55
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,193
Ugh. Come on.

56
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,441
I've seen the way you stare at her.

57
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:02,406
I don't stare!

58
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:05,258
Bertholdt, please, life's short enough as it is.

59
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,319
Just go for it, 'kay? Besides, you're both
killers so she understands where your head is.

60
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,859
What're you two doing now?

61
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,115
I thought we were waiting till dark.

62
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,238
There's been a slight change of plans.

63
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,473
I'm gonna ask you nicely not to try to put up a fight.

64
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,821
Easy. There's no need for us to get all violent.

65
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,579
It's not like I can resist like this.

66
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,764
I mean, take a look at me. Just, calm down, okay?

67
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:53,023
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die, you evil...!

68
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,930
Bastard! I'll... I'll kill you!

69
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:04,121
I'll rip you apart!

70
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:06,458
Explain to me why we're leaving early.

71
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,590
Ymir. When you changed back into a human,

72
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:13,608
d'you have any memory of the person you ate?

73
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:18,732
Huh. No, not really.

74
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,746
We're talking about something
that happened five years ago.

75
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,480
But the way you're asking, I'm
guessing that it was someone you knew?

76
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:38,449
I see. Then I'm, uh, sorry for not remembering.

77
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,037
Hey, it's not your fault that you don't.

78
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,224
It was the same for Reiner and me.

79
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,597
Yeah?

80
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,767
Eren doesn't remember either.

81
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,000
Is that how it works?

82
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:00,602
You hold that against me?

83
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:05,369
I don't think so. I mean. I don't know.

84
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:09,421
Suppose I have to believe you didn't want to eat anyone.

85
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,822
How, uh, how long were you wandering outside the walls?

86
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:18,326
Oh, about sixty years. Hell on earth.

87
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:22,164
Every day was like waking up into a nightmare.

88
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,868
Red smoke signal, sir.

89
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:39,755
The hell?

90
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,904
Commander Erwin, we're surrounded!

91
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:48,795
There is a way around. Should we head towards it?

92
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:53,228
No. We don't have time for a detour.

93
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,455
We'll forge ahead! Soldiers! Prepare to fight!

94
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,851
For now, we find a place without Titans!

95
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:05,662
As far away as possible!

96
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,316
I haven't recovered enough to outrun these guys.

97
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,709
They surround us, there's jack
shit my Titan form can do right now.

98
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,774
Then why the hell didn't we
just wait for the sun to go down?

99
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,153
Smoke signals? Did the Scouts come to save us?

100
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:24,665
Damn it. That Formation wouldn't work unless
they hoisted a bunch of horses over the wall.

101
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,358
Who gave that order?

102
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,799
I honestly thought we had more time than this.

103
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,753
It's gotta be Commander Erwin.

104
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:33,523
Hard as nails, that one.

105
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,348
Damn. They're already that close?

106
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:41,262
It's Eren's fault for losing his cool.

107
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:48,370
Wait. Is she...?

108
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:52,619
Christa's here.

109
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,931
Reiner! We have to go back! Now!

110
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,258
Christa's with them!

111
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:59,308
...What? ...This is our best chance!

112
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:01,779
You're full of it! No way you can see that far!

113
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:06,082
Look, I just know! Think about
it, okay? She's a big softie, right?

114
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,428
Stupid girl's come to rescue me! She had to!

115
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,422
Yeah, well so what?

116
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,091
I'm sorry! It'll have to wait!

117
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,062
What?

118
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,811
We can't grab her the way things are now!

119
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:20,860
There's no way to bust up that formation!

120
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:22,434
Another time!

121
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,626
How long you want me to wait?

122
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,242
Maybe I should just hold off on that until
I've been gobbled up by one of your warrior pals?

123
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,275
Oh no! I don't think so!

124
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,587
Don't be that way!

125
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:35,376
Nobody's trying to trick you, I swear it!

126
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,582
Prove it, then!

127
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,936
There's no time like the present, asshole!

128
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,725
Damn you! Get down there and bring her with us!

129
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,187
I need to see her!

130
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:46,802
You don't understand.

131
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:50,345
The way things are going, I never will.

132
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:01,237
We can't.

133
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:05,042
Let it go, Ymir.

134
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:12,669
Who knows whether we'll even manage to
survive this. Sorry. It's just too risky.

135
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,150
Listen to me. You have my word.

136
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:18,344
I want her out of this as much as you do.

137
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:22,125
Bear with me. You have to trust us!

138
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,636
This is what's best for Christa!

139
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:27,066
Do you understand?

140
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:32,778
Yes, I understand. Real question is, do you?

141
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,368
Of course!

142
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:36,607
All right, then.

143
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:38,767
Thank you for that.

144
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:44,353
It's happening again. I've come so far.

145
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:50,254
Done so much. And still wound
up falling for my own bullshit.

146
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,553
Well. They look promising.

147
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,367
What about this one?

148
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:05,423
Mm.

149
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:07,821
Hello there.

150
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,666
How would you feel about coming to live with us?

151
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,948
Think of it as the start of a brand-new life.

152
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:18,271
Of course, a brand-new life needs a brand-new name.

153
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:20,663
Don't you agree?

154
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:21,909
Huh?

155
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,500
That day... That was the first time I lied to myself.

156
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,354
Told myself I had no say in the matter.

157
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,800
That I never had a choice. But...

158
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:38,897
It is this Lady Ymir that inherits
the blood of His Majesty the king.

159
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:44,504
So long as she graces us with her
presence, immortality shall be ours.

160
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,895
To be fair, it wasn't all that bad.

161
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:59,810
My food wasn't cold. I no longer slept in the dirt.

162
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:01,938
Lady Ymir.

163
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,999
Best of all, I knew what it meant to feel needed.

164
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:10,495
For the first time in my life, I
actually meant something to someone else.

165
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:14,301
That, by far, was more precious than anything.

166
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:17,184
Then, one day...

167
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:25,359
It's her fault! The girl's to blame!

168
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,282
She said the blood of the king flowed in her veins!

169
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,491
We're only guilty of believing her!

170
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:37,141
I was cruelly reminded that
everything I clung to was an act.

171
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,754
Is that so?

172
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:42,726
I-I only...

173
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:54,708
It's true.

174
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,589
I am Ymir!

175
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,095
The king's blood runs through me!

176
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,465
Lie once, the rest follow easy.

177
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,279
If it saved their necks, so be it.

178
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:16,184
Trouble was, things didn't quite work out that way.

179
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:23,427
Help me!

180
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:32,819
Stop this! I'm begging you! It's not right!

181
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:44,736
That's when I realized I'd had it coming all along.

182
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:49,149
I'd deceived those gullible bastards,

183
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,109
but that wasn't what I was being punished for really.

184
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,318
It was for deceiving myself

185
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,877
into thinking someone needed me.

186
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,388
What else did I expect?

187
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:04,320
That's what comes of looking at the world through a veil.

188
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,621
Titan! Run!

189
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:29,749
No!

190
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,512
When I opened my eyes,

191
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:00,801
the first thing I saw was freedom.

192
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,335
The first thing I thought

193
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,399
was if there's such thing as fate,

194
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,340
she's a fickle little whore.

195
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:12,330
Right then and there

196
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,119
I made a vow.

197
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,527
No more deceiving myself.

198
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,777
No more falling for my own line.

199
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,130
From then on, I'd be real.

200
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,262
So, how did that play out?

201
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,602
Ah, the child was given the name "Christa Lenz."

202
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:37,849
Then, she was packed off to the Cadet Corps.

203
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:39,399
That is a pity.

204
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,973
Poor wretch. Would've been better were she never born.

205
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,762
Are you trying to pick a fight?

206
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,757
All right, sure. Makes no difference to me.

207
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,479
And then...

208
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,649
What do we have here?

209
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:02,079
This your idea of trying to be nice?

210
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:04,906
Well, uh.

211
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,515
And then I met you.

212
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,146
Immediately, I could tell.

213
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:13,879
You and I were the same.

214
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,818
You nourished yourself on lies.

215
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,566
Together, we give our hearts!

216
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:22,092
Sir!

217
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:27,695
Here was someone desperately trying to
convince herself of something she knew wasn't true.

218
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:30,769
I get it. Believe me.

219
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,247
And don't worry.

220
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:36,141
I'm not asking you to understand.

221
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:42,051
No. What I want is very simple.

222
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,126
Just let me be honest with myself one last time.

223
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:47,475
That's all.

224
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:52,981
Let's face it, guys. I'm the one best suited for this.

225
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:58,878
What are you doing?

226
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:01,786
Hey, shut the hell up and use your head for a second.

227
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:05,077
In a forest like this I'm the one who can shine. Right?

228
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,823
Ymir! Knock it off! We'll fall!

229
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,604
Do you think that I give a damn?

230
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,288
I have the advantage.

231
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:22,317
Any other time you two would outclass me.

232
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,430
But my Titan form's more agile.

233
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:29,832
I could leap through the trees, grab Eren, and
rendezvous with the Scouts before you knew what hit you.

234
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,533
Wouldn't be that hard.

235
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,127
Either you agree to take Christa with us today, right now,
or so help me I will throw your whole plan out of whack!

236
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:43,465
Uh! Are you completely insane? That doesn't help her!

237
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,292
I thought that you genuinely cared!

238
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,653
I do. In my way.

239
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:51,102
If it robs her of a future, then life's a bitch,

240
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:54,390
but by god I will live to see her again!

241
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:57,319
I've made my peace with what that says about me.

242
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,072
You guys have no idea what it's like.

243
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:02,599
She knows what a shitty person I am,

244
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,879
but she still smiles at me. I can't...

245
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:07,334
Damn it.

246
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:11,306
Don't be pissed. I have a fairly decent plan.

247
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,164
Besides, if I stay and fight,

248
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:15,484
it'll be easier for you three to get away.

249
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:18,717
Then again, if you don't like it,

250
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:21,833
we can always tear each other apart like animals!

251
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:35,194
That light.

252
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,005
You saw it, too, huh?

253
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,486
It's coming from the forest!

254
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:41,183
I think someone's transforming into a Titan!

255
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:44,785
We're out of time. Soldiers, disperse!

256
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,771
The enemy has assumed Titan form!

257
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,599
Find Eren and get him out of there!

258
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,690
Another MP.

259
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,748
Battle is not our objective!

260
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:06,497
Locate, recover, and retreat!

261
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,993
Round up the horses!

262
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,248
Right away, sir!

263
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:17,940
First thing we do is pinpoint
the enemy and tell the others!

264
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,401
They're fleeing through the woods, so stay sharp! Break!

265
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,863
Eren.

266
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,696
Where are you?

267
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,065
That's the scream of a Titan!

268
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:33,049
It came from just up ahead!

269
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,843
I can see you!

270
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,255
No, wait a second!

271
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:48,118
It's actually Ymir! This is her Titan
form. She's one of the people they took!

272
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,343
What the hell happened?

273
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,045
Where is everybody else?

274
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,471
Is Eren okay?

275
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,707
What about Bertholdt and Reiner?

276
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,126
So this is Ymir.

277
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:04,165
Did she assume Titan form to take on Reiner and escape?

278
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:07,243
Ymir! What's the deal? Did you
manage to get away from them?

279
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,729
What direction did they go?

280
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,256
Give us something to go on! Anything!

281
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,530
Say something already!

282
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,341
C'mon, ugly! We're kinda in a rush!

283
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,552
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?

284
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,960
Something isn't right.

285
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,823
Why... Why is she looking at us one by one?

286
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,182
Ymir!

287
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,018
There you are!

288
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:36,049
Thank goodness you're all right!

289
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:44,647
What?

290
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,644
Did she just...? Ymir, what are you doing?

291
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:54,420
Don't just stand there! Move your asses!

292
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,458
She's fast! We're losing her!

293
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,279
Why would she do that?

294
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,670
What's wrong with you people?

295
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,395
Am I seriously the only one who saw this coming?

296
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:09,104
Well, it's clear where her loyalties are now!

297
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,542
She and Reiner are on the same side!

298
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:13,410
We were lured into a trap!

299
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:17,056
Heads up. She's back.

300
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,200
Good.

301
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:44,965
Oh, no!

302
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:49,804
No! They're getting away with Eren!

303
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:55,023
Move it! Get on your damn horses!

304
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,359
This ain't over, y'hear me?

305
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:08,132
I'll get him back if it costs me my life!

306
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:44,968
Pursuit and battle become one.

307
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,501
Hunter versus hunted.

308
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:51,649
Emotions run high between friends turned enemies.

309
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,084
Betrayal calls for blood.

310
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:57,595
Loyal soldiers perish in droves.

311
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:00,948
In a game of chance for the fate of mankind,

312
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:04,833
Commander Erwin bets on a do-or-die strategy.

313
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:10,039
Next episode: "Charge."
