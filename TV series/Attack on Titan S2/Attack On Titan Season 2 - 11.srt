1
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:05,786
Heads up. She's back.

2
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:06,667
Good.

3
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:25,242
Oh, no!

4
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,438
No! They're getting away with Eren!

5
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,710
Ride! Let the Titans chase you!

6
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,364
All squads, follow my lead!

7
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:48,648
Do what? Erwin, you conniving bastard!

8
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:50,808
You're using us as bait again?

9
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:52,691
It's the only way!

10
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:56,989
You've fought well as MPs. Now give your all as soldiers!

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,473
The Armored Titan must be stopped before he takes Eren.

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,758
Failure is not an option!

13
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:49,465
Reiner's too slow! We've got 'im!

14
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,834
I won't hesitate this time.

15
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,010
I'll kill them without a thought.

16
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,895
If Ymir feels like getting in the way,

17
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,810
so much the worse for her.

18
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:03,075
This ends here and now. I swear it!

19
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:18,434
Christa!

20
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,430
Ymir.

21
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,495
Ymir!

22
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:41,922
Christa...

23
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:43,751
No...

24
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,527
Historia, I'm sorry about eating you.

25
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,824
You're uh, probably pissed.

26
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,511
Wha-What is this? I...

27
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,021
What's going on? Talk to me!

28
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,414
We came to rescue you and Er...

29
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:03,430
Just shut up!

30
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:07,759
I don't need rescuing. Things have changed.

31
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,554
I'm with Reiner and Bertholdt now.

32
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,683
Like it or not, you're coming with us.

33
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,624
There's no future inside the walls.

34
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,957
Hear me out for a second, okay?

35
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,515
Life outside isn't as bad as you think, believe me.

36
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:31,618
For starters, there's no one saying the world
woulda been a better place if you'd never been born.

37
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:36,656
Yeah, I don't think Titans would say much either way.

38
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,278
They'd be too busy trying to devour me!

39
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:40,931
We've all got flaws!

40
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,948
They're not so bad if you'd just give 'em a break!

41
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,823
It's complicated, all right? Get off your high horse!

42
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:50,900
Ymir! I don't know what's going on in your
mind, but you're not making any sense! Come on!

43
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,752
What did Reiner and Bertholdt say?

44
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,725
You're doing this against your will, they threatened you!

45
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,275
It's the opposite, actually.

46
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:08,429
I'm right, aren't I? Let go!

47
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,892
Whatever they've got on you, I don't care!

48
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,305
We can fight them!

49
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,728
Put the past behind you!

50
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,816
What matters is right now!

51
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:20,439
I'm here! I will always be your ally!

52
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:27,961
Ymir!

53
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,811
Look. In case you haven't
noticed, the Scouts are closing in.

54
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:38,539
If we'd left earlier, there might've
been a decent chance of outrunning them.

55
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,424
Going back for Christa was your idea.

56
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:44,236
You forced us. Remember that.

57
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:49,018
We waited. For what? Damn it, Ymir!

58
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,185
What the hell did we do this for?

59
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,290
You can't have a change of heart!

60
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,931
You want her to rot inside the walls?

61
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,400
Does that seem acceptable to you now?

62
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,871
Don't be a fool! Think!

63
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,708
Let go! Don't listen to him!

64
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:05,734
I can't!

65
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,122
I wish I could.

66
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:16,872
I'm sorry, sweetie.

67
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:19,566
I know you think I did this for you.

68
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:23,729
But at the end of the day, I did it for me.

69
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:32,483
A long time ago I stole the Power of
the Titans from one of their comrades.

70
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,938
Not much I can do against them.

71
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,520
Sooner or later, I'm screwed.

72
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:42,859
But, they said if I cooperate, hand you over,

73
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,617
maybe I've got a shot at leniency.

74
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,286
Maybe my crime gets overlooked.

75
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,819
You're crucial to the Church.

76
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,482
You know the truth about the walls!

77
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,352
My family? That's it, isn't it?

78
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,323
Sure. Why not?

79
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:04,774
When this world started going to hell

80
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:09,961
I thought to myself, "couldn't hurt to
have a bargaining chip in my back pocket."

81
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,869
The castle's as close to death as I ever wanna get.

82
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,554
Whole experience traumatized me.

83
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:18,286
Gave me perspective.

84
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,847
If I have to play dirty to stay alive,

85
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,571
then I have to play dirty.

86
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,218
Pathetic, yeah. Doesn't make me the ideal friend.

87
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:29,675
Like I said, though, I didn't do this for you.

88
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:34,450
You deserve better, but there it is.

89
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:38,778
I need you.

90
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,711
Please save me, Historia!

91
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:52,329
Well, like I said.

92
00:07:56,284 --> 00:08:00,296
I'm here, and I will always be your ally!

93
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:43,315
Reiner! Protect us!

94
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:59,222
All right, then. Looks like Ymir goes first!

95
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:01,909
Mikasa, no!

96
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,683
You're not going to kill Ymir.

97
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:10,037
That all depends on her. What'll it be?

98
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,850
She can step aside or she can die. Her choice.

99
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:17,990
That's not fair! She'll die if she doesn't go
along with what Reiner and Bertholdt tell her to do.

100
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:19,785
She's screwed either way!

101
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:24,274
Listen, there's only so many
lives I can give a damn about.

102
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,603
Cruel, but that's the world
our enemies gave us six years ago.

103
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:32,583
Sorry. I don't have any
heartstrings left for you to tug on.

104
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,412
If you want compassion, move on.

105
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:37,905
You want fair, tough shit.

106
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,511
Time's wasting. Pick your side, Christa.

107
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,500
Eren? Or the bitch I'm gonna kill?

108
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,654
Ymir, stop!

109
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:51,254
Look at her face! She means it!

110
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,792
Don't make a move!

111
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,999
Quit struggling! It's not going to help!

112
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:09,271
Good luck talking sense into that one, Bertholdt.

113
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:12,044
When something lights a fire under him, that's it.

114
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,752
Getting Eren to calm down's a lost cause.

115
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,357
Take my word for it.

116
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:19,031
I've been on the receiving end more than you have.

117
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:21,109
Whaddya say we teach him patience?

118
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,198
C'mon. Show yourself.

119
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:26,383
Give him back! Right now!

120
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:30,515
Guys, really? This is some kind of joke, right?

121
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,469
No way this is you.

122
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:34,773
You've been lying to us this whole time?

123
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,806
We were supposed to be comrades!

124
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,992
They still are! This is all just a misunderstanding!

125
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,871
Where d'you think you're going?

126
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,970
You can't keep running forever.

127
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,910
We're not gonna let that happen. Rat bastards.

128
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:56,113
Through thick and thin we slept under
the same roof as soldiers for three years.

129
00:10:56,168 --> 00:11:00,833
Matter of fact, the positions you could
sleep in were an art from, Bertholdt.

130
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:05,735
I'm not kidding. We all loved waking up
to see your contortions in the morning.

131
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,626
Used to predict the weather with 'em.

132
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,699
How'd you do it, Bertholdt?

133
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,218
Must not've had a care in the world.

134
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,026
Lying beside your victims, yet you slept like a log.

135
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,347
Was it all just an act to you?

136
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:24,310
What about the way we used to
talk about surviving this together?

137
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:28,236
About growing old, looking back
on the worst of it over drinks.

138
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,524
Remember? Was that all bullshit?

139
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,750
Answer me!

140
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:38,923
Go on. What was the point? What were you trying to do?

141
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,766
It doesn't matter anymore.

142
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,786
Shut up and focus on opening the traitor's neck.

143
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:49,030
Hesitate for a moment and we forfeit Eren.

144
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:51,730
Who cares what they pretended to be?

145
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,723
This was their choice.

146
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,353
No! You're wrong!

147
00:11:57,561 --> 00:12:00,858
Who chooses to be this? Tell me!

148
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:07,975
What d'you think I am? Huh? What?

149
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,210
You think this is what we aspired to be?

150
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,492
People loathe us. And why wouldn't they?

151
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,264
We're monsters!

152
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,037
We deserve to die for the things we've done.

153
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:27,418
We're lost. We could live a thousand
years and never again know peace.

154
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,278
Try to imagine that darkness.

155
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,337
The only light was our brief time as soldiers.

156
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:37,245
It was never a lie! Do you understand?

157
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,773
We're not who we said we were, but it wasn't an act!

158
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,697
We genuinely thought of you as our friends!

159
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:49,426
I'm not stupid. I know I have no right to ask forgiveness,

160
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,961
but please. I beg of you.

161
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,007
If we were comrades, someone find us.

162
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,937
Give him back. I won't ask again.

163
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:13,353
I'm sorry. I can't.

164
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,395
One of you has to do it.

165
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:21,496
One of you has to stain your hands with my blood!

166
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,375
Guys! Get down from there and take cover!

167
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,490
What the hell's Erwin doing?

168
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:31,000
He's off his rocker! Look!

169
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:35,124
The lunatic's leading the Titans straight for us!

170
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:58,346
Jump, damn you! Get the hell out of there!

171
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,988
Squadrons break! Make the Titans scatter!

172
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,176
Historia!

173
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,863
What's going on? Is this hell?

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,312
Not yet. But it will be.

175
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:45,337
All soldiers charge!

176
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:45,888
Huh?

177
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:48,707
We've come to the moment of truth!

178
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,639
Mankind's fate is decided now!

179
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:56,979
There is no future in which we reclaim these
lands without Eren... and there never will be!

180
00:14:57,136 --> 00:15:00,658
Go! Recover Eren from the Armored Titan and retreat!

181
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:04,893
Your heart and soul to the cause!

182
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,133
Mikasa, wait!

183
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,683
This is madness.

184
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,998
The Scouts have taken one too many hits to the skull.

185
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:20,863
...Look out!

186
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,688
...Huh?

187
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,357
What's happening out there?

188
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,872
Ugh! If only I could see!

189
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:39,351
I can't move. 'Less I can shake these Titans,

190
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,519
it'll only get worse.

191
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:46,032
Okay, then. Heads up, Bertholdt.

192
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,804
Brace yourself!

193
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:52,372
That's right. Just a little more!

194
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,326
It's working! His hands are down!

195
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,913
Now's our chance!

196
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:59,989
Uh, Mikasa? You can see those Titans, right?

197
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:01,906
I mean, I get it, you're strong.

198
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,582
But that's one hell of a mess.

199
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:05,808
Slipping through isn't gonna be easy.

200
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:08,501
Advance!

201
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:17,713
Commander Erwin!

202
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:22,433
I said advance, goddamn it!

203
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:27,167
Eren's right in front of you! Do not falter!

204
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,148
Mikasa!

205
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,288
You piece of shit! Get your hands off her!

206
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,496
We've come too far to give up now.

207
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,699
We <i>are</i> going home. And Eren is coming with us.

208
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,709
No. This is all on me.

209
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,602
People are dying because I got caught!

210
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:33,967
Bertholdt!

211
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,624
Armin?

212
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,661
That's the irony, really.

213
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:46,061
If you can't let it go it's not worth holding on to.

214
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:48,977
Advance!

215
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:54,182
Think. What is it I have to let go of?

216
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:59,228
My life? Or something else?

217
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,790
So, you're okay with this?

218
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:25,405
Leaving your friend behind to face the music?

219
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:31,285
I guess Annie was weighing you down?

220
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,359
D'you know where she is?

221
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:38,221
Way up north in the Utopia District. Being tortured.

222
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:43,464
The silent treatment only goes so far.

223
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:49,796
The body may heal, but her screams are an
object lesson on the limits of endurance.

224
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,288
Oh, don't worry, they're taking special
care she doesn't die... or get a moment's rest.

225
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,990
So many methods, so little time.

226
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:02,462
Mustn't waste a prize specimen like Annie.

227
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:04,179
She's too precious.

228
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:08,230
Shut your mouth, hell spawn! I'll kill you!

229
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:31,213
All soldiers, retreat!

230
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:47,351
I did it.

231
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,114
I actually killed one. You all right?

232
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,354
Get away from her!

233
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,686
What the hell were you trying to pull?

234
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:57,655
We're leaving!

235
00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:59,888
Yeah, couldn't you go for some grub right about now?

236
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,527
You don't understand! Let me down!

237
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,678
Please!

238
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:04,225
Huh?

239
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:09,334
Reiner and Bertholdt are going to kill
Ymir unless we both agree to go back with them!

240
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:12,290
She'll only be free if she hands me over!

241
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:15,183
I'd already decided to let that happen.

242
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,440
Are you nuts? What if it's a trick?

243
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,617
It's not! Let me go!

244
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,658
Conny's right! Whatever she said, it's a lie!

245
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:25,977
Don't listen to her!

246
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:28,551
This doesn't make sense.

247
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:32,507
Why would someone who fought tooth and nail to
save your life just turn you over to the enemy?

248
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:33,985
What's the end game?

249
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:41,009
The only time Ymir bothers to make
an effort is when you're in danger.

250
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,505
I don't know what kind of trouble she's in,

251
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,889
but for now just calm down till we know more.

252
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,852
Exactly. Either way, we can't stick around.

253
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:53,363
Whatever Ymir needs you for, I'm
sure you won't be much good to her dead!

254
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:59,067
Damn straight. Even I could figure that one out.

255
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,035
He's tossing Titans now?

256
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,402
That son of a bitch has gone berserk!

257
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,630
Eren! Mikasa!

258
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:36,557
Eren.

259
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:46,026
Eren encounters the very Titan that devoured his mother.

260
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:50,329
He stands paralyzed with fear
as Hannes rushes to protect him.

261
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,743
Who is the real enemy?

262
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:55,260
What is the nature of this war?

263
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:58,764
Not knowing against whom to brandish their blades,

264
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,180
the Scouts nevertheless fight on.

265
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:03,658
What does the future hold?

266
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,706
And at what cost?

267
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:10,293
Next episode: "Scream."
