1
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,766
(MISAKI sighs)

2
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,470
[YUKIMURA]
Thanks for your help, Kanou.
I owe you one!

3
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:45,010
[KANOU] Not at all.
[MISAKI] Kanou?

4
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,382
[YUKIMURA]
He was nice enough to help me
carry these papers.

5
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,822
[MISAKI]
When did you two get so close?

6
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:53,459
[KANOU]
I thought that if I
spent a little more
time with Yukimura,

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,564
it would help me get over
my weakness with women.

8
00:01:55,665 --> 00:02:00,173
[YUKIMURA] Huuhhh... I already
told you‐ I'm NOT a girl!
[MISAKI] Uh...
[KANOU] Indeed.

9
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:02,946
[YUKIMURA]
Now you're just agreeing without
meaning it again!

10
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:04,181
[KANOU] Indeed.
[MISAKI] YUKIMURA.

11
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,785
Y‐yes, ma'am?

12
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:09,760
[MISAKI & HAGIMOTO]
Get stronger...

13
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,332
[YUKIMURA]
Ah! For some reason, I can hear
what you're all thinking!

14
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,172
[YUKIMURA]
I'll show you! Take a good look!

15
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:19,846
Cuz the next time you see me,
I'll be the manliest man you've
ever seen!

16
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:24,589
[YUKIMURA]
I'm gonna become‐
a man among men!

17
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,764
[YUKIMURA]
All right, I'm going to go get
the rest of the papers. By
myself! ...So there!

18
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,235
[KANOU]
Let me help you with that!

19
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,638
[YUKIMURA]
Forget it! I'm doing it alone!

20
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,043
[KANOU]
It's impossible for
one person to do.

21
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,581
[YUKIMURA]
But when I do, I'll be so manly
that you'll be shocked!

22
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,218
[YUKIMURA]
Then I'll pay you
back for your help!

23
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,726
[MISAKI, thinking]
Eh‐heh. We've found a good
guardian. Heh.

24
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:46,365
[MISAKI, thinking]
Oh, yeah. Speaking of "payback."

25
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,371
[USUI] You want to pay me back?

26
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,077
[MISAKI]
(heavy breaths) Yes.

27
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:56,318
[MISAKI]
You helped me with that stalker,
the sports festival, and KANOU,
among other things.

28
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:58,958
I can't keep staying
in your debt like this.

29
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:02,631
[USUI]
Then how about you be my
personal maid for just one day.

30
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,770
[MISAKI]
Ah?! There's no other way?

31
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,876
[USUI]
Uh, well... Let's see...

32
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:12,719
Is that really what you want to
do‐ to make me your "personal
maid" for a day?

33
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,825
[MISAKI]
I already knew you were a
pervert, but I didn't think
you were on this level.

34
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,394
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
He's the real deal.

35
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:19,632
If that's the best thing
you can come up with,

36
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,569
that actually makes me
kind of worried.

37
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,943
[USUI]
Oh really? So you're saying
you'd rather do something more
promiscuous?

38
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:25,945
[MISAKI]
Whaaat?!

39
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,180
[USUI]
I was just joking.

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,583
[MISAKI]
Ugh...

41
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:31,556
[USUI]
Time for work, Miss President.

42
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,796
(MISAKI growling)

43
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:37,936
[MISAKI]
Just what are you planning,
Usui you idiot?!

44
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:49,559
[SHIROKAWA]
"Grave misfortune. You may lose
something important to you.
Watch out, Master."

45
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:55,303
[SHIROKAWA] (cry of agony)
This is terrible! What's this
"something important"?!

46
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,476
[SHIROKAWA] (panicking)
Is it that? Or is it THAT?
What is it?!

47
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:00,180
[MISAKI]
Shut up...

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,919
[SATSUKI]
That was the only bad fortune
we put in the whole lot.

49
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,190
[SUBARU]
So in a way he's actually
lucky at being unlucky.

50
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,196
[SARASHINA] Calm down, Shiroyan.
[KUROSAKI] Yeah, don't worry‐
WE got great fortunes!

51
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:10,266
[SHIROKAWA]
Whaddya mean "don't worry"?!
That doesn't help me at all!

52
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,439
[MISAKI]
Please be quiet, Master! They're
only handmade fortune cookies.

53
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,443
[KUROSAKI]
Uh? Then, Misa, you have one!

54
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:18,617
[SARASHINA]
If you get the same fortune as
Shiroyan, it should cheer him up
a bit.

55
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,853
[SHIROKAWA]
UH?

56
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,560
[MISAKI]
Small Fortune...

57
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,098
[KUROSAKI & SARASHINA]
That sucks...

58
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,202
[SHIROKAWA] (life draining)

59
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:34,114
[MISAKI]
"Let's repay those debts..."

60
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:41,328
[SUBARU]
I'm sorry, Master, but
we're already closed for
the night‐ Uh?

61
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,801
[MAKI]
Pardon our intrusion.

62
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:47,007
[MAKI]
But we are not customers.

63
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,244
[MISAKI]
The vice president
of Miyabigaoka?

64
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:51,482
[MAKI]
Excuse me, but where might I
find the owner of this shop?

65
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,090
[SUBARU] Um, well...
[SATSUKI] I'm the store
owner. And you are...?

66
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,929
[MAKI] My apologies
for the suddenness.
[SATSUKI] Uh?

67
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,302
[MAKI]
But I am interested in
purchasing this café from you.

68
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,673
[ALL]
Huh!?

69
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:07,781
Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Kanade Maki.

70
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:10,687
[MAKI]
I represent the
Maki Dining Group.

71
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:12,390
[SATSUKI]
Huh? The Maki Dining Group?

72
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,230
[AOI] Are they famous?
[SUBARU] Aoi, you haven't
heard of them?

73
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,836
[SATSUKI] The Maki Dining Group
is a major restaurant company

74
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:21,844
that runs everything from
casual dining restaurants
to ultra‐exclusive bistros.

75
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:26,887
To think that you know so
much about my father's company.
It is truly an honor.

76
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:28,757
[AOI]
He's the boss's son?

77
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:32,531
[MAKI]
Actually, in the near future,
we will be opening a new
restaurant.

78
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:36,673
[MAKI]
When considering the clientele,
we found this location to be
ideal,

79
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,178
so we entered into negotiations.

80
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:42,350
[SATSUKI] Um, with whom?
[MAKI] The building owner.

81
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,787
[TRIO]
The building owner?!

82
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,390
[SUBARU]
You're going to buy
the entire building?

83
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,129
[MAKI]
Unfortunately, we could not come
to an agreement...

84
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,433
[OWNER]
Hmph! I'm keepin' this building
till the day I die!

85
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:53,239
[OWNER]
I ain't gonna go botherin' my
tenants with this hullabaloo!

86
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,748
[OWNER] Get the heck outta here,
you whippersnapper! I ain't
goin' nowhere!
[MAKI] Therefore, I've been

87
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,519
[SARASHINA] There's no way we're
gonna let that happen!

88
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,523
[SHIROKAWA]
You're sayin' Maid Latte would
have to shut down, right?!

89
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,660
[KUROSAKI]
Go open your fancy‐shmancy
restaurant somewhere else!

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,232
[MAKI] The kind of shop we would
like to open here is...
[TRIO] Listen to us!

91
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:12,511
[MAKI]
Well, as employees of this shop,
I'm sure you require little
explanation. It's a butler café.

92
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:14,983
[SARASHINA] I object!
[KUROSAKI] That's not
cute at all!
[SHIROKAWA] Long live maids!

93
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,258
[MAKI] And so, we would like to
open our shop here if possible.
[TRIO] We said, listen to us!

94
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,164
[MISAKI]
Isn't it a little much to
buy an entire building for
one little café?

95
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:27,174
[MAKI] Indeed. That's why we
plan to demolish the building
and construct an English‐style
manor in its place.

96
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:28,743
[SATSUKI]
Uh...

97
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:32,350
I suppose you could say
it's less a café and more
of a restaurant.

98
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,591
[MAKI]
We also plan on offering a
full‐course dinner menu.

99
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,931
[MAKI]
Essentially, it will be the
ultimate butler café experience.

100
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:43,006
[AOI]
Wait a minute! So your so‐called
"butlers" are just glorified
waiters?

101
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,910
You can't just call it
a "butler café" and‐!

102
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,380
[TORA]
Of that he is well
aware. Trust me.

103
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,619
[MISAKI]
(shocked)

104
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:55,430
After all, he is the
incredibly talented vice
president of Miyabigaoka
High School, you know.

105
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:02,410
[MISAKI, thinking]
Miyabigaoka's student council
president: Tora Igarashi!

106
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,851
[MISAKI]
What the hell is he plotting?

107
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:10,393
He performs his support
functions as vice president
most excellently.

108
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:14,468
[TORA]
You could say he knows firsthand
the fulfillment that comes from
supporting one's master.

109
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,276
[TORA]
I have no doubt he will be
able to create a truly
splendid restaurant.

110
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:23,252
[TORA]
He has my support not only as
student council president, but
as his friend as well.

111
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,204
[TORA]
However, if you still doubt the
quality level of his butlers,

112
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:36,813
why not come to the footman
auditions we'll be holding next
week and see for yourself?

113
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:40,721
[MISAKI] "Footman"?
[MAKI] Staff members who
work under the supervision
of the butlers.

114
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:47,300
To hire footmen of the highest
caliber... We will be conducting
our interviews more in the style
of a cattle call audition.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,371
[KUROSAKI]
Auditions?! What is this some
kind of singing competition?!

116
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,475
[SARASHINA] Why're you already
trying to hire people?!

117
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,479
[SHIROKAWA]
No one's said they're gonna sell
this place to you, have they‐?!

118
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,381
[TORA] (menacing)

119
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:57,154
[TRIO] (frightened)

120
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:59,692
[TORA] Perhaps we should take
our leave now, Maki.
[MAKI] Sir.

121
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:03,567
[TORA] They will obviously need
some time to thoroughly think
things over.
[MAKI] Sir.

122
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:09,078
Although we may be excusing
ourselves for the day, we will
be continuing with our plans to
purchase this building.

123
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:12,685
[MAKI] Please look over our
offer in detail while
considering this matter‐

124
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,023
[MAKI] I'm sure you will
find the sum agreeable.
[SATSUKI] (dead on the inside)

125
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:18,663
[MAKI]
However, if you have any
concerns regarding monetary
assistance for outplacement

126
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:22,470
and store relocation we shall
gladly re‐examine our numbers.

127
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:27,047
[TORA]
Farewell for now.

128
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,625
[MISAKI]
Please wait!

129
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,597
[MAKI]
May we assist you?

130
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:39,505
Do you think it wise to be
walking around in public in
attire such as that?

131
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:43,011
[MISAKI] Why HERE? Are you
doing this because of me?
[BOTH] Hm?

132
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,083
[TORA] Heh..

133
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:46,185
[MAKI]
What are you‐

134
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:47,955
[TORA]
Maki. You go ahead.

135
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,258
[MAKI]
Huh? But sir, I‐

136
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:51,896
[TORA] Maki. That is an order.
[MAKI] Hm?

137
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,266
[MAKI]
Sir.

138
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:02,818
[MISAKI]
I see your acting is as
good as always, Igarashi.

139
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,722
[TORA] And you...

140
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,098
Have got some interestin'
clothes on, as always.

141
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,268
[MISAKI] Nngh!

142
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,139
[MISAKI] (surprised) Ah?

143
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:23,627
[TORA]
Y'know, this is the first time
Maki's been trusted to open up
a place all on his own.

144
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,664
[TORA]
I'm just watchin' from
the sidelines.

145
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:28,336
[TORA]
He's mighty serious about
makin' his shop a success.

146
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,507
[MISAKI]
We're just as serious!

147
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:34,481
This shop was built through the
hard work of our manager and all
of the Maid Latte employees!

148
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:38,356
[MISAKI]
And we have loyal customers who
come here every single day!

149
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:41,162
[MISAKI]
So... Have you thought
about them at all?

150
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:45,069
[TORA]
You sure do love bein'
a maid, don't you?

151
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,545
[TORA]
You plannin' on becomin' a real
pro and workin' here after you
graduate?

152
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:52,450
Then you're gonna have to try
takin' on Maki for real.

153
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:57,561
If you really wanna beat him and
save your maid shop, you gotta
prove just how serious you are.

154
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,233
For example, there's
next week's auditions.

155
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:07,515
That'd be the perfect
opportunity... to show off your
pro customer service abilities.

156
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:11,288
[TORA]
Oh, my bad. Girls aren't allowed
to compete. (driving off)

157
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:19,471
[MISAKI]
I almost forgot. I still owe him
BIG TIME for our last little run
in at Miyabigaoka!

158
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,074
[USUI] That's for sure.

159
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,379
[MISAKI]
I won't forgive him for this!

160
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:27,487
[MISAKI]
I WILL get him back,
no matter what it takes!

161
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,390
[SUBARU]
Please allow me to
take your luggage.

162
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,993
[MISAKI]
May I take your hand...?

163
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,830
[BOTH]
My Lady.

164
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,474
[SATSUKI] They're perfect.
(TRIO giggling excitedly)

165
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:57,681
[SATSUKI]
Misa, Subaru, your
disguises are amazing!

166
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,420
[SATSUKI] There's no way anyone
would guess you're girls!

167
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:01,989
[SUBARU] Still, it's strange.

168
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,194
To think that taping our chests
down and wearing wigs

169
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:06,733
would affect our appearance
so profoundly.

170
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,402
[MISAKI] Sorry, Subaru.
[SUBARU] Huh?

171
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,841
About having to drag you
along with me like this...

172
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:14,381
[SUBARU]
Don't worry. After all,
the participants have to
compete in pairs.

173
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:18,857
Besides, when I saw how
determined you were to fight
to save Maid Latte...

174
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:22,029
[SUBARU]
I knew there was no way I could
let you take this on alone!

175
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,739
Right. If we can use these
auditions to show them just how
capable our staff is,

176
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,478
I think we can show them that
we're not going down so easily.

177
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,352
[ERIKA]
Actually, I really wanted to
compete, too, but I have a chest
that can't be hidden! Hehe!

178
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:36,793
[SUBARU] Yes we're so lucky to
be flat‐chested, aren't we?
[MISAKI] (awkward) Heh...

179
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,736
[MISAKI, thinking]
If it weren't for the fact
that I worked at Maid Latte,

180
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:45,343
I'm sure those guys never
would've gone after the
store like this.

181
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:50,486
[MISAKI, thinking]
Because of me, a place that
everyone holds dear, could be
destroyed!

182
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:53,426
[MISAKI]
I definitely won't
let that happen!

183
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,529
[SATSUKI]
All these guys are
here to try out?

184
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,131
[MISAKI]
There's so many people
I can barely move!

185
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,403
[ERIKA]
It's like dude central
station up in here!

186
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:19,612
[HONOKA]
I think that guy's afro is
taking up more room than all
these guys combined.

187
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:22,384
[SATSUKI]
They must've posted
fliers up all over town.

188
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:25,724
[BUTLER A] Looks like they're
going to test you on your
physical skills more than
anything else, huh?

189
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:29,097
[BUTLER B]
Yeah, since there's no
interview this thing's
gonna be a walk in the park.

190
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,201
[BUTLER C]
And the pay is just too
good to pass up!

191
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:34,509
[SUBARU]
"Those interested, please come
to the conference hall," huh?

192
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,579
That's the Maki Dining
Group for you.

193
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,420
They can pull a crowd like
this with the strength of
their name alone.

194
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:42,591
[MISAKI] Is there something
wrong, Manager?

195
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:44,662
[SATSUKI]
Um, not really.

196
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:48,268
I was just thinking about how
we're going up against people
from a different world...

197
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,511
[ALL] (flabbergasted)
[MAKI] My apologies
for the wait.

198
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,917
[MAKI]
Thank you very much
for being here today.

199
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:59,358
[MAKI]
Without further ado, the
auditions will now begin.

200
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:04,067
[MISAKI, thinking]
That voice... It's Miyabigaoka's
vice president, Kanade Maki!

201
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,474
[MAKI]
Our first event of
the day will be...
...the marathon.

202
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:10,079
[HONOKA] Huh? A marathon?
[SUBARU] What kind of audition
is that?

203
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:13,419
[MAKI] The course will be the
hill you all no doubt traversed
to get here.
[SATSUKI] That sounds hard.

204
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,793
[MAKI]
You will head to the bottom of
the hill, where a turnaround
point has been prepared.

205
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:22,370
[MAKI] Once you've made your way
back up, you will then head to
the gymnasium, where I, your
judge, will await you.

206
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,275
[SUBARU]
Um... I'm suddenly not
feeling very confident.

207
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:27,347
[MISAKI]
Don't worry, we'll do our best
to get through this together.

208
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,952
[MAKI]
However, as you will recall
this is an audition of pairs.

209
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:34,060
[MISAKI] Huh? Gah...
[MAKI] In order to win, you
must piggyback your partner
to the goal line.

210
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,033
[BUTLER D] So it's like a test
of determination?
[MAKI] Although one of you must
carry the other,

211
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,205
[BUTLER E] Looks like
things are heating up.
[MAKI] you are permitted to
change places freely throughout

212
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:43,278
[BUTLER F] This is a bad joke.
[BUTLER G] Let's just quit now.
[MAKI] The first 50 teams to
cross the finish line will win.

213
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,418
[MAKI] Now then, please assemble
at the starting line.

214
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,088
[MISAKI]
All right‐ let's go, Subaru.

215
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,961
[SUBARU]
Huh? Ah! Uh, are you
sure about this?

216
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:55,771
Of course‐ this is gonna be a
piece of cake. I'll carry you
the whole way if I have to.

217
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,374
[SATSUKI] Wait, Misa.
[MISAKI] Oh?

218
00:13:57,474 --> 00:13:59,945
[SATSUKI]
That's enough. I've seen what
we're up against.

219
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:03,587
Winning something... like
this... is just impossible.

220
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:08,797
I should've known we wouldn't
stand a chance going up against
a wealthy company like this...

221
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:11,368
Besides, if they find out that
you're girls‐ Ohhh...?

222
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:14,609
[MISAKI]
So you're going to give up
before things have even started?

223
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,946
That's not like the
Manager I know at all.
[SATSUKI] But I‐

224
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:21,789
[MISAKI]
I know that what I'm saying may
sound selfish, but... I don't
WANT to quit.

225
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,392
[SATSUKI]
Ahhhhh...

226
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:29,772
[SUBARU]
Don't worry guys, I'll be
right there with Misa to make
sure she doesn't get hurt.

227
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:32,109
[MISAKI]
All right, wish us luck.

228
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:37,855
[HONOKA]
Once she gets a fire under
her, it sure does stay lit,
doesn't it?

229
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:42,029
[ERIKA]
I like a girl with
determination! Misa'll
find a way to pull this off!

230
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,367
Isn't that right, Manager?

231
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,204
[SATSUKI]
That's right...

232
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,089
[SUBARU]
A‐are you okay? I'm
not too heavy, am I?

233
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,759
[MISAKI] Don't worry, it's fine.

234
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,328
[SUBARU]
You're sure...?

235
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,299
[MISAKI, thinking]
Despite what I told the boss,

236
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,871
it's MY fault we're in this
mess in the first place.

237
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:08,817
[MISAKI]
The president of Miyabigaoka has
me in his sights, and because of
me, Maid Latte could‐

238
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,185
[JUDGE A] Is everyone ready?
[MISAKI] Uh?

239
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:13,860
[JUDGE A]
Take your positions...

240
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,335
(aggressive racing)

241
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:24,047
[ERIKA] Do your best, guys! We
believe in you! Crush 'em!
[HONOKA] The race just started
and Misa's already whipping

242
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:25,984
[ERIKA] Go get it!
We know you can do it!

243
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,353
[SATSUKI]
Don't push yourselves too hard!

244
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:31,094
[SARASHINA] L‐O‐V‐E!
Goooo, Misa!!
[ALL] Huh?

245
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:32,329
[BUTLER E]
I'm dying...

246
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:34,000
[BUTLER F]
C'mon, man‐ let's switch.

247
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,571
[BUTLER G] I can't go on...

248
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,173
[BUTLER H]
It's too much for me!

249
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:42,885
[SUBARU] Are you sure you're
doing okay, Misa?
[MISAKI] I'm just fine!

250
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,189
[MISAKI, thinking]
Like I thought, it's hard to
move in this suit,

251
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,093
but if I can just make it up
this hill, we've got this!

252
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,430
[KUROSAKI] That's the spirit!
[SHIROKAWA] Let's do our best
together, Misa!

253
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,069
[SHIROKAWA]
If we're with you, we'll have
the strength of a hundred men!

254
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,007
[KUROSAKI]
With Shiroyan and I
there's no way you'll‐

255
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:55,711
[KUROSAKI] Ack... ah...

256
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:58,617
[MISAKI] What the heck
was that about?
[SHIROKAWA] Aaah, Kurotatsu!

257
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,923
[MISAKI & SUBARU]
Uh?!

258
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:05,631
(BUTLERS freaking out)
[MISAKI] I guess all sorts of
people are participating in this
event, huh?

259
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,500
[SUBARU] So it seems...

260
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,041
[MAN A] You are Number 38.

261
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:14,313
[MISAKI] (heavy breathing)
[SUBARU] It's amazing how fast
some of the other competitors
are.

262
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:16,051
[SATSUKI]
Great work, you two!

263
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:17,555
[ERIKA]
You did awesome, Misaki.

264
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,892
[MISAKI] No, not at all.
[ERIKA] Do your best, Subaru.

265
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,196
[SUBARU]
Would you please stop this
blatant sexual harassment.

266
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,102
[ERIKA]
But you're a guy, so touching
your chest doesn't count as
sexual harassment.

267
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:28,275
[SUBARU] Of course it counts‐
now please quit touching me!
[YUKIMURA] Hey, Kanou!

268
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,212
[YUKIMURA] You'll let me handle
the next event, right?

269
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:32,116
[KANOU] It's impossible.
[MISAKI] What are THEY doing
here?!

270
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,953
[YUKIMURA]
How do you know it's impossible
if you won't even let me try?

271
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,155
[KANOU]
I just know.

272
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,457
[ERIKA]
Is something wrong, Misaki?

273
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,861
[MISAKI]
Erika... Eh?

274
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:40,867
[MISAKI]
Your glasses... I need to borrow
them right now!

275
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,203
[ERIKA] Huh?

276
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:44,240
[MAKI]
Those who passed
the first event,

277
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,277
please head to the
gymnasium at once.

278
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:48,783
[MAKI]
The second event will
soon be underway.

279
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,289
[SUBARU]
Seriously, this is their
school's gymnasium?

280
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:58,703
[HONOKA]
This place is more like
a sports arena than a gym.

281
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:00,974
[ERIKA]
I can barely make the two of
them out from up here...

282
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:03,245
[SATSUKI]
Look at how plush the cushioning
on these seats is...

283
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,915
[YUKIMURA]
This is amazing, KANOU.

284
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,719
[MISAKI] Gah!
[KANOU] Indeed.

285
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,390
[MISAKI]
Those guys are interested
in this kind of job?

286
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,663
[MISAKI]
If they see me,
I'm totally busted!

287
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:15,536
[KUROSAKI] Yahoo‐!
[SHIROKAWA] We made it too,
Misa‐!

288
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,708
[MAKI]
Once again, I welcome you all.

289
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:21,114
Congratulations on passing the
first challenge and making it to
the second round.

290
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,589
[MAKI]
I'm sure a few of you were
caught off guard by that rather
strange event.

291
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,959
[SHIROKAWA] Misa
stepped on us...!
[KUROSAKI] (happy pain)

292
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,667
[MAKI]
The purpose of the first
challenge was to test your
earnestness and determination.

293
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:34,875
[MAKI]
As you may or may not know,
the job of a footman is a
very difficult one.

294
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,652
And because it is difficult, it
requires the strength to keep up
with your peers no matter what.

295
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:43,158
It is for that reason that
we required all entrants to
have a partner.

296
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:46,464
[MAKI]
This audition will test your
abilities to work with your
partner,

297
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,641
and assess whether
you can perform as a
full‐fledged footman.

298
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,378
[MAKI]
The assessment shall be made by
myself and the butlers,

299
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:57,153
and we ask for your cooperation
here at this venue and beyond.

300
00:17:57,253 --> 00:18:01,763
[MAKI]
Now, please allow me to
introduce Miyabigaoka student
council president, Mr. Igarashi.

301
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:05,604
[BUTLERS] (intrigued)
[MISAKI, thinking] I knew
he'd be around here somewhere!

302
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:10,312
[MISAKI] Just you watch: I'll
see this through to the end!
[MAKI] And now, let us begin the
next event.

303
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,558
[MISAKI] Get outta my WAYYYYY!

304
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,846
[MAKI] Excellent work.
[BUTLER A] I'm so tired!

305
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,752
[MAKI] The first round, to gauge
your physical strength, is now
complete.

306
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,154
(BUTLERS breathing hard)

307
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:33,225
(BOTH breathing heavily)
[MISAKI] That the
best they can do?!

308
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,733
[MAKI]
Will all contestants please
change before we begin Round 2.

309
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,405
[MAKI]
You've each been provided with
tailcoats and a uniform.

310
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:42,778
[MAKI]
Please change into
them within one minute.

311
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,949
[MISAKI & SUBARU] One minute?!
[MISAKI] Are they crazy?!

312
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,888
[MAKI] This challenge will test
the quickness of your thinking
and your reflexes.

313
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:50,325
[MAKI] Are all
contestants ready?
[MISAKI] Huh?! We have
to change HERE? No way!

314
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:53,767
[MAKI]
Please note that the two‐person
changing rooms will fall down
once your time is up.

315
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,006
[MISAKI & SUBARU] (freaking out)
[MAKI] And... Begin!

316
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:58,677
[MISAKI] Th‐this is bad...!

317
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:01,347
[MISAKI]
Just hurry up, Subaru...
Uh, I mean, MISTER Subaru!

318
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:03,318
[SUBARU]
I‐I know that, Mister MISAKI!

319
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,755
[SATSUKI] (freaking out)

320
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,493
[ERIKA]
Uh oh. I do not foresee
this ending well.

321
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:11,568
[HONOKA] MISAKI's fast at
everything, so I'm sure she'll
be fine... but Subaru...

322
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:13,338
[MAKI] Your time is up.

323
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:16,612
[SUBARU] (squeal)
[HONOKA] Yep. Called it.
[BUTLERS] (confused adlibs)

324
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,883
[BUTLER H] Huh?
Was that a girl?
[BUTLER I] No way!

325
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,254
[SUBARU] I'm sorry... MISAKI.
[BUTLER K] This audition is
for men only, right?

326
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:23,258
[BUTLER J] That was a girl!
[BUTLER L] Nobody realized
it till now?!

327
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:25,062
[KUROSAKI] Oh, crap!!
[SHIROKAWA] (freaking out)

328
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:29,003
[BUTLER M] I bet those freaks
in the masks are the girls!
(shaking)

329
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:32,745
[BUTLER H] That makes sense.
They're way too suspicious!

330
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:35,817
[AOI]
Jeez. I knew these masks
were a stupid idea.

331
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,688
[AOI]
All that hard work for nothing!

332
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,425
[BUTLER A] A guy?
[BUTLER B] Wait, a girl?
[BUTLERS] (confused)

333
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:41,729
[BUTLER C] Which one is it?

334
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:43,498
[MISAKI]
Usui and Aoi are here, too?!

335
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,536
[SUBARU]
So that WAS Usui then,
I knew it.

336
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,975
[MISAKI]
Huh? Subaru, you knew
it was them all long?

337
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,548
[AOI] Of course I'm a boy! It's
obvious‐ are you people blind or
something?!
[SUBARU] Not really, I just

338
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,185
[MISAKI]
What kind of reason is that?!

339
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:55,690
[MAKI] Only males of high school
age or older may participate.

340
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,664
Before we continue I'm afraid I
must ask your gender and age.

341
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,838
[AOI]
I'm a man. And my age is... 14.

342
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:04,842
[BUTLER D] Dude, you're young!
[BUTLER E] You're in middle
school?!

343
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,678
[MAKI] In that case....
[AOI] Yeah, yeah, I know,
I know‐

344
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,817
I'm disqualified, right?! That's
why I wore that stupid mask!

345
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,887
[MAKI]
I must also ask that
individual over there.

346
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:14,193
[MAKI]
You are a woman, are you not?

347
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:15,997
[SUBARU] Yes, I am.

348
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,435
[SUBARU]
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:20,372
[MISAKI]
No, no. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:23,378
[MAKI]
Very well, both partners are
automatically eliminated.

351
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,784
[MAKI]
Please exit the
premises immediately.

352
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,888
[AOI] Hmph...

353
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:31,829
[SUBARU] Huh? Misaki?
[AOI] Huh?

354
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,377
[TORA] Say, Maki.
[MAKI] Sir?

355
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,247
[TORA] May I make a suggestion?

356
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:44,053
Those two were able to make it
this far with a child and a girl

357
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,959
as their partners‐ surely
they must be quite skilled.

358
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:51,167
[TORA]
It would be a terrible shame to
lose such talented personnel.

359
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:54,340
[TORA]
Why not let the remaining two
stay and form a new pair?

360
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,582
[TORA] That is... as long as
they both meet the proper
criteria.
[MISAKI] (shocked)

361
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:05,663
[MAKI]
Very well. Will the remaining
contestants please confirm that
they are indeed qualified?

362
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:08,736
[USUI]
Seventeen years old.
High‐school student. Male.

363
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,441
[BUTLER A]
The one with the glasses
is a bit suspicious.

364
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,813
[BUTLER B]
If anyone's a girl, it's him!

365
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:24,467
[MISAKI]
Sixteen years old.
High‐school student.

366
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:25,402
[USUI] Ah?

367
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:27,006
[MISAKI] And I am...

368
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,347
[MISAKI] A BOY!

369
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:32,650
[TORA] (taken aback)

370
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,619
[BOTH] WHOOOOAAA!

371
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,654
Uwahhhhhh!

372
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,291
[SATSUKI & ERIKA]
(shocked)

373
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,273
[USUI] Flat as an ironing board.

374
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:46,846
(BUTLERS laughing)

375
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,348
[SATSUKI] [ERIKA] Uh...

376
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,553
[BUTLER C] Looks like he was
hoping it really was a girl!

377
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,089
[BUTLER D]
I knew he was a guy all along.

378
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:54,829
[BUTLER H]
Yeah, it's totally obvious.

379
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:10,793
[MAKI] Sir.

380
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:14,902
In that case. We will now
move on to the second round.

381
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:56,071
[MISAKI]
After an intense first round,
I've now been paired with Usui
of all people.

382
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:58,008
[USUI]
It must be fate, Mister Misaki.

383
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,611
[TORA]
Hmph! You're an
interestin' girl.

384
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,648
[MISAKI]
See‐ there goes Tora again,
acting all uppity!

385
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:04,020
[USUI]
You should just glare back at
him. He's staring too much.

386
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,594
[YUKIMURA] Aah! I'm
so scared, Kanou!
[KANOU] Just take a
few deep breaths.

387
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:11,167
[MISAKI]
Oh, no! YUKIMURA AND KANOU! I'll
just sneak this way...! Ungh...

388
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,371
[MAKI]
And so, we shall now
proceed to Round 2.

389
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:15,676
[YUKIMURA]
Oh, no! It's starting!
(heavy breathing)

390
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:19,918
[KANOU]
It's not starting. At least,
not until the next episode.
