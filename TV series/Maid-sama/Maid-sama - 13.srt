1
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,429
Guh!

2
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,864
Ugh!

3
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,666
AH!

4
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,568
Oohhh!

5
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,236
Aaahh!

6
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,305
(groaning in pain)

7
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,674
[PUNK A]
H‐hey... We give up
already, Aratake!

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,410
[PUNK B]
Yeah, we get how tough you are!

9
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,481
[PUNK C]
We're sorry, man.
We weren't tryin' to start
nothin' by starin' at you.

10
00:01:55,582 --> 00:02:00,486
[PUNK D]
Yeah, everyone around already
knows you're the number one guy
at Seisen Jr. High!

11
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,657
[ARATAKE]
Then I guess it's about time
that I introduce myself.

12
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,959
[PUNK D]
Huh? To who?

13
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,829
Seisen Junior High's
former legend...

14
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,535
[ARATAKE]
The guy they call the
Tornado, the White Demon:
Naoya Shirokawa!

15
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,647
Finally, I thought
class would never end!

16
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,015
Today's Girls in
Glasses Day, isn't it?

17
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,450
Let's hurry up
and go, go, go!

18
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,085
[SHIROKAWA]
Why don't you try
runnin', dumbass?!

19
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,319
[KUROSAKI]
All right! It's a race!

20
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,420
[SHIROKAWA]
You guys couldn't keep up!

21
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,589
[SARASHINA]
What did you say?!

22
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,123
(TRIO continue
taunting each other)

23
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,859
[KONDO]
Aratake...

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,326
It's just a coincidence.

25
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,029
That small fry couldn't
possibly be the White Demon.

26
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,765
[TAHARA]
Looks like he dropped somethin'.

27
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,836
Let's follow him
just to be sure.

28
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,438
[TRIO]
Misaaaaa! We're back!

29
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,940
[MISAKI]
Welcome back, Masters.

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,042
[ARATAKE]
What the‐?! What's that
weird‐lookin shop?

31
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,179
[OKITA]
It's one of those things,
ain't it? Y'know, a maid cafÃ©.

32
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,349
That thing's freaking me out.
No way in hell am I going in a
place like that!

33
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,786
It's gotta be someone else
who has the same name.

34
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,421
[KUROSAKI] You're paying today,
right, Shiroyan?
[ARATAKE] Huh?!

35
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,291
Huh? What're you talking
about, Kurotatsu?

36
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,026
[KONDO]
Wait, did he just say...?

37
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,629
[KUROSAKI] Cuz it's
your turn, Shiroyan!
[SHIROKAWA] Huh? ME?

38
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,298
[Naoe]
So... then that
really is him...?

39
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,669
(grunting)

40
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,972
There's no way
this can be right!

41
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,242
(school bell ringing)

42
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,778
Misa's off today,
so I guess we'll
do THAT, huh?

43
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,548
Oh, you mean the
legendary super‐speed
training!

44
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,083
We'll have our Maid
Latte points saved
up soon enough!

45
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,419
[SHIROKAWA]
This time for sure, we'll get
a picture taken with Misa.

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,121
[YUKIMURA]
Someone please help me!

47
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,589
[TRIO]
Huh?

48
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,692
Oh! Shirokawa, Sarashina,
and Kurosaki! (panting)

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,194
[KUROSAKI]
What are you doing,
Vice President?

50
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,531
Whoa! I didn't recognize
you at all, man!

51
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,199
Hey, look, you're dressed
up like a girl again.

52
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,235
Are you sure you're
really a boy?

53
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,537
Of course I'm a boy!

54
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,105
I didn't want to‐ he
forced me to wear this!

55
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,910
[HAGIMOTO]
Yukimura, don't say anything,
just put on this girl's uniform,
and come to my house‐ QUICK!

56
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,179
Huh? What do I have to that for?

57
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,850
[UTSUMI]
Hagimoto's mom has been hounding
him for like, four years to get
a girlfriend. She's crazy!

58
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,119
[UTSUMI] So put that on and
pretend to be his girl. 'Kay?
[YUKIMURA] Huh?!

59
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,121
Please, I'm begging you!

60
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,823
That's what happened, I swear!

61
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,292
[SHIROKAWA]
Sorry, but we don't really
have time for this.

62
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,461
[YUKIMURA]
Ngh! Wait a second!
You've gotta help me!

63
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,896
[SHIROKAW]
I'm tellin' ya, We're busy.

64
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,931
[KUROSAKI]
What do you want us to
do about it?

65
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,669
[YUKIMURA]
I'd at least like to change!

66
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,538
[YUKIMURA]
Please get me some clothes
before someone sees me!

67
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,206
[KUROSAKI]
Forget about it.

68
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,275
Don't say that! Please,
I'll do anything!

69
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:40,313
You look cute, so what's the
problem? It's not like anyone's
gonna recognize you.

70
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,949
[ARATAKE]
She's "cute," huh?

71
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,385
[ARATAKE]
That's a careless
comment to make.

72
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,553
What the?

73
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,288
[YUKIMURA] Ah!
[TRIO] Huh?

74
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,390
[ARATAKE] I'll just hold onto
this for you.

75
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,192
If you want your
girlfriend back,

76
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,728
then you'll have to
come fight me for her!

77
00:04:54,828 --> 00:05:01,334
As the legendary Senior of
Seisen Junior High School...

78
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,404
[TRIO]
Huh?

79
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,673
Did you find him?
No, no sign of him..

80
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,677
But I told my mom I'd
be bringing my girlfriend
over tonight!

81
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,579
What are you two doing
in the hallway?

82
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,315
Argh! I, uh, I forgot to
separate the recyclables
from the trash!

83
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,052
Whoa! And I have to write
the script for tomorrow's
school broadcast.

84
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,721
[BOTH]
See you later!

85
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:29,029
[MISAKI]
Huh? Where'd these come from?

86
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,930
President?

87
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,097
Uh? Usui!

88
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,966
Did you strip
search someone?

89
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,601
D‐Don't be ridiculous!

90
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,038
Of course I didn't! (grumbling)

91
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,641
[USUI]
If you wanted to strip someone,
all you had to do was ask me.

92
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,844
[MISAKI]
I'm telling you, I didn't
strip anyone! Stupid pervert.

93
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,045
[TRIO]
GLOOOM...

94
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,113
Huh? What's wrong with you guys?

95
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,715
President...

96
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,317
What's with this weird
aura around them?

97
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,153
The student vice president's
been kidnapped.

98
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,021
Huh?

99
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,390
Crows are scary!

100
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,660
[MISAKI]
So then that school
uniform was Yukimura's?

101
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,294
Miss President,
you forced him to‐

102
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,863
Enough with the
stripping already!

103
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,331
And? What was with
those guys earlier?

104
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,000
We were their seniors,
we knew them back

105
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,202
in junior high when
we were their
upperclassmen.

106
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,639
And when they said "White
Demon" we recognized'em
right away, right?

107
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,640
Huh?

108
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,241
Yeah, what was that all about?

109
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,710
Shiroyan, are you
the "White Demon"?

110
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,713
You got it! How do
you like me now?!

111
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,548
Oh. The legend
himself, huh?

112
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,550
What kind of a
reaction is that?!

113
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,319
I didn't know Seisen Jr. High
had such wimpy delinquents,

114
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,221
guess that explains a lot.
[USUI] Mhm.

115
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,489
What's that
s'posed to mean?!

116
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,857
Still, delinquent or not,

117
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,458
he said he wasn't gonna
fight anymore.

118
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,861
All cuz his mommy was
getting on him about it.

119
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,497
Dude, you know how
scary my mom can be!

120
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,033
True, if you stare right at
her, you see your life flash
before your eyes...

121
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,468
So that means you have
no intention of fighting
them, right?

122
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,070
Nah, I'm gonna
go have some fun!

123
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,839
Wanna come take cosplay
pictures with us?

124
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,073
No way.

125
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,475
[MISAKI]
I have to go help
Yukimura, I guess.

126
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,712
[SARASHINA]
You "guess"?

127
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,382
[USUI]
It looks more normal
than I expected.

128
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,752
Yeah, I thought it'd
be all broken down

129
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,121
and covered in graffiti
or something like that.

130
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,623
What kind of school is that?

131
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,691
Somebody here told me
there have been fewer

132
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,793
delinquents around
since we graduated.

133
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,294
Huh? Really?

134
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,363
Well? Where did
they take Yukimura?

135
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,898
Hm? I dunno! Ha!

136
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,366
I dunno either!

137
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,968
I've got an idea.

138
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,470
How about I break your
thumbs clean off your hands?

139
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,540
[SHIROKAWA] Huh?
[MISAKI] Sarashina, do it!

140
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,874
[SHIROKAWA & KUROSAKI] NOOO!

141
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,243
[SARASHINA] Shiroyan! Kurotatsu!
I can't do it!

142
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,514
[AOI]
What do you idiots think you're
doing in front of my school?
You're embarrassing me.

143
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,349
Is that you Aoi?!

144
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,417
So you go to Seisen Jr. High?

145
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,954
So what if I do? Look,
just go away already.

146
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,488
You're making a big
scene out here.

147
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,690
Is it Aoi?

148
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,759
AH! Uh, yeah, but,
uh, that is...

149
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,663
That's Akanoske Aoi, 14
years old‐ isn't that right,
Miss President?

150
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:43,864
[MISAKI] Yeah, yeah!

151
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,832
[AOI]
I can't be seen with you guys...

152
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,201
[MISAKI]
Hey, wait! There's something
I need to ask you real quick.

153
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,304
[AOI]
Yeah, I know him. Aratake, he's
a third year student, right?

154
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,041
He's made a name for himself,
now he's the head of some
other delinquents.

155
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,111
Still, there aren't as many
as there used to be around
here lately...

156
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,547
I feel like I've seen
him before. Weird.

157
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,982
Akanoske Aoi, right?

158
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,751
Maybe we've run into
him at Maid Latte or
something.

159
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,821
Before I enrolled, apparently
there was a band of delinquents

160
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:12,859
that caused all sorts of
trouble, but now they've more or
less disbanded, and get into a
few isolated fights.

161
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,062
That's beside the point!
What's the school going
to do about this!

162
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,767
[USUI]
Alright, alright. Yukimura
should be our number one
priority now, right?

163
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,836
[USUI]
It's getting pretty late...

164
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,573
Their secret hideout!

165
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,478
[YUKIMURA]
H‐hello? Is someone there?

166
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,649
Why is this happening to
me in the first place?

167
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:41,522
What should I do? I'm tied
up and my bag and cellphone
are back at school.

168
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:46,459
As if that's not cruel
enough, people keep
mistaking me for a girl!

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,094
(door kicked open)

170
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,978
(teeth chattering,
wincing from fear)

171
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,719
Jeez. I told these guys
not to be so rough.

172
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,354
E‐excuse me‐

173
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,990
Don't move! I'm not lettin'
you get away, understand?

174
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,292
[YUKIMURA]
Please wait! Just tell me what‐

175
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,694
[ARATAKE]
This isn't about you.

176
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,529
Just keep quiet and nothin'
will happen to you.

177
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,997
But at least tell me‐

178
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,400
The one I'm after is the
White Demon. Even he...

179
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,203
is bound to go back to his
old self if I've got his girl.

180
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,340
I'm telling you, you've
made a mistake! I'm not
a girl at all! Look!

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,976
I'll prove it to you!

182
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,511
Idiot!

183
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,312
[ARATAKE]
What're you doin?!

184
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,716
You wanna die, you crazy woman?!
What are you tryin' to do?

185
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,585
I'm not a woman either!

186
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,153
A woman shouldn't go
showing her body like that!

187
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,223
Also, there's somethin' else
that's really been bothering me.

188
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,359
You talk WAY too much like
a guy, you know that?!

189
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,830
Would it kill you to try and
sound a little more lady‐like?!

190
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,667
Look, just sit there
and shut up!

191
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:03,269
Uh...

192
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,339
[YUKIMURA]
But I...

193
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,909
AM a boy though...

194
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:15,281
[MISAKI]
Jeez! If you had a clue,
you should've said so in
the first place!

195
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,552
[SHIROKAWA]
Well, it was our secret hideout,
so I had to keep it secret.

196
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,955
[KUROSAKI]
And it was well‐known throughout
the neighborhood as a bad‐ass
delinquent hangout.

197
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,791
Then it wasn't much of a
"secret" hideout, was it?

198
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,259
Are you sure about this?

199
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,928
It's not like we can just stroll
into their hideout,

200
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,563
whether it's secret or not...

201
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,264
That's right, we're
still in our uniforms.

202
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,266
There's the risk that
bad rumors about Seika High

203
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,836
could start floating around
if we're not super careful.

204
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,138
Then you're going to go all
the way home and change?

205
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:42,308
But by the
time you managed to regroup it
would be nighttime, so why don't
you just leave already?!

206
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,679
[MISAKI]
At this point, shouldn't we
just go the police instead?

207
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,584
[SHIROKAWA]
Uh? That's all right. If we go
to Seisen, we can get everything
straightened out ourselves.

208
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,052
[SHIROKAWA]
All right everybody, let's go!

209
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,854
[KUROSAKI & SARASHINA]
Bounce! Bounce!

210
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,922
[MISAKI]
H‐hey! You're still wearing your
school uniforms!

211
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,425
I swear, you guys are completely
hopeless. Fine, I'll help..

212
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,463
[SHIROKAWA]
"Maid Sama!" will be back...

213
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,464
[KUROSAKI]
after this short break.

214
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:06,299
[TRIO]
Woo‐hoo!

215
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,004
[SHIROKAWA]
Oh, a Misa doll!

216
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,438
[KUROSAKI] Nice!
[SARASHINA] I want one!

217
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,306
[MISAKI] Shut up!

218
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,775
[TRIO]
Okay...

219
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,077
[AOI]
I told you to keep your filthy
paws offa me!

220
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,145
I'm not some cheap broad you
can touch whenever you like.

221
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,247
[SHIROKAWA]
What're you talkin'
about, dammit?

222
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,650
[KUROSAKI]
That's goin' a bit far,
don't ya think?

223
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,985
[USUI] YOO!

224
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,687
What the hell do you
punks think you're doing?

225
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,454
Get your hands off my girl.

226
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,557
Or I'll friggin' kill ya!

227
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,892
What'd you say?

228
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,894
You got a problem? Let's
throw down right here!

229
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,361
[MISAKI] Hold it right there!

230
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,398
That girl's with me! If
somethin's up, then‐ (crunch)

231
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,602
[MISAKI]
Sorry. I bit my tongue.

232
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,136
CUT! What are you doing?!

233
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,171
It's an easy line‐
quit screwing it up!

234
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,473
Sorry. I don't have what
it takes to be an actress...

235
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,975
What're we doin anyway?

236
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,077
Isn't it obvious‐
we're playin' delinquent!

237
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,947
This way, people will
think we're just acting
out a scene from a movie.

238
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,282
In other words, no one
will pay attention...

239
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,020
[AOI] This way we can go stroll
right into that hideout without
any problems, right?

240
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,823
[KUROSAKI]
I guess‐ but did we really hafta
do those stupid lines?

241
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,025
[MISAKI]
Also, where'd you
get these clothes?

242
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,493
[SARASHINA]
I'm telling you, I've
seen this guy somewhere‐

243
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,630
[AOI]
Shut up! Quit your complaining!

244
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,264
Just hurry up and
do this so we can go!

245
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,465
(chuckling)

246
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,700
What's up, Shiroyan?

247
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,602
(laughing)
Nothin' at all.

248
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,338
Don't get all sappy and
sentimental on me now,
Shiroyan.

249
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,106
(munching)
It's embarrassing.

250
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,712
[ARATAKE]
The White Demon...

251
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,081
[KUROSAKI]
You went and got
ANOTHER action figure?

252
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:32,586
[SHIROKAWA]
Hah! This one's rare,
so don't ya dare touch it!

253
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:33,620
[OKITA] I pass.

254
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,321
[NAOE] Seriously, again?

255
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,126
[MISAKI]
So how are we supposed
to get inside?

256
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,328
We have to hurry and help
Yukimura before they kill him!

257
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,064
[SUZUNA] Is that you Sis?
[MISAKI] Suzuna!

258
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,566
[SARASHINA]
Is that your little sister?

259
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,734
[SUZUNA]
Thank you for always
looking after my sister.

260
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,836
Are you off to give
someone the smackdown?

261
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,505
[MISAKI]
NO! Look it says on the sign!

262
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,840
[MISAKI] We're filming,
all right?! Filming!
(ALL agreeing)

263
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,844
[SUZUNA]
It looks like fun. I wanna
try playing the final boss
or something.

264
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,146
Look, Suzuna, just go
home. It's dangerous.

265
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,583
Then how about I play a
hitman or an assassin instead?

266
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,184
I told you, it's not
that kind of story!

267
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,119
Fine, then take these
snacks if you want.

268
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,221
They're frozen pot stickers
I won over at the mall.

269
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,090
How're we supposed to eat
something that's FROZEN?!

270
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,593
Frozen pot stickers should
not be taken lightly.

271
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,795
[SUZUNA]
The taste of the meat and
vegetables is locked in

272
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,463
at a temperature of minus
60 degrees Celsius,

273
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:21,067
and they're so delicious that
even a five‐star Chinese
restaurant couldn't...

274
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,070
Aratake, there's no way
this guy's gonna show!

275
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,842
Yeah, it's been two years since
anyone's called him the White
Devil, though, hasn't it?

276
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,879
[PUNK A]
Yo, look, he's cryin'!

277
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,480
[PUNK B]
(laughing) What a wuss!

278
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,249
[PUNK C] You were all big
and bad before, what happened?

279
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,552
[SHIROKAWA] What're you
assholes doing?
[PUNKS] Huh?

280
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,821
[KUROSAKI]
Yeah, that guy's from
our school all right.

281
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,122
[SHIROKAWA]
Unforgivable!

282
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,124
[SHIROKAWA]
Bein' a bully is SO uncool.

283
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,992
[PUNK B] What's this idiot
talkin' about?

284
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,194
[KUROSAKI]
Don't worry, he's just
talking some smack.

285
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,131
Criminal scum.
Come at me then, bro!

286
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,633
[PUNK B]
Huh? What'd you say, dammit?!

287
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,835
[KUROSAKI]
Don't worry, he's just
talking more smack.

288
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,337
[PUNK C]
Don't screw with us!
We'll kick your ass!

289
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,305
(fighting)

290
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,312
[SHIROKAWA]
Hey Kid... what're you spacin'
out for over there?

291
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:11,251
Your hero has finally
arrived. Try and be a
little more grateful.

292
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,289
The White Demon... will
definitely come after her...

293
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,025
[MISAKI]
She finally went home...

294
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,761
That endless frozen pot
stickers speech, tho.

295
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,997
I guess any sister of
yours couldn't exactly
be "normal" huh?

296
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,431
She sure was pretty.

297
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,900
Now's not the time for this!

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,234
That's right‐
we've gotta hurry up

299
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,903
and help Yukimura
before they find out.

300
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,104
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

301
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,739
[SATSUKI]
Ah, Misa is that you?!

302
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,208
What's this?! You're
making your own movie?
[MISAKI] Manager!

303
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,010
[SATSUKI]
Oh my, and Aoi's with you too!

304
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,312
Is this the script?
Show me, show me!

305
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,480
Woooow...

306
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,082
ANOTHER interruption?

307
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,251
Delinquents, huh? If you guys're
doing a school drama,

308
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,453
then you have to have
that one line:

309
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,290
"We ain't no rotten
oranges." You know?

310
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,559
[KUROSAKI] "Rotten oranges"?
[SARASHINA] What's that
supposed to mean?

311
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,562
[SHIROKAWA]
It means fruit is most delicious
when it's just been picked.

312
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,898
[KUROSAKI]
Whoa! Then that means we
didn't fully ripen yet!

313
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:02,603
Hey, Misa, that outfit looks
really good on you. It's so
different that it's awesome!

314
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,572
Awesomely differently cute!
It's not good it's great!

315
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,474
Hey, I know! How about
we do a Delinquent Day
for our next event?

316
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,178
We could call our male
customers "Dude" and the
female ones "Sis"!

317
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,982
[SATSUKI] Honoka and the others
would totally go for it! And
Erika, too!
[AOI] Come on...

318
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,651
[ARATAKE]
Why isn't he here?

319
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,554
[NAOE]
He told everyone he was
retirin' after junior high,

320
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,824
so I guess he doesn't want
anything to do with guys
like us anymore.

321
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,727
I heard he was scared of someone
takin' him on in high school.

322
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,194
That's enough,
you guys.

323
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,764
Shirokawa was Aratake's
upperclassman

324
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,166
who he respected
more than anyone!

325
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,570
You're saying you
wanna get stronger?

326
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,772
[KUROSAKI]
Big talk comin' from a dude
who's crying like a little baby!

327
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,743
[SHIROKAWA]
That's right. First thing you
gotta do is get really crazy!

328
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:45,445
Listen, it's no good askin'
an idiot like this for‐

329
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,080
Hey! Kurotatsu!

330
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,652
Still, when this guy loses it
he gets about a hundred times
stronger,

331
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:55,088
that's why they started calling
him the White Demon‐ pretty lame
nickname if you ask me.

332
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,990
[SHIROKAWA]
Shut up, it's cool dammit!

333
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,861
The way I fight is so awesome,
it's like settin' off a tornado
or something!

334
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,895
[ARATAKE] So...

335
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,664
[BOTH]
Huh?

336
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,231
So cool!

337
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,235
[SHIROKAWA] (laughing)
Hey, why don't you come with us?

338
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,107
[AOI] She FINALLY left.

339
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,142
[USUI]
I wonder if Yukimura's
still alive...

340
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,044
[MISAKI]
We have to hurry and help him.

341
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,713
[SAKURA]
There you are, Misaki!

342
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,047
[SHIZUKO]
We heard from Suzuna.

343
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,716
You're doing your own
movie shoot, are you?

344
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,917
Again?

345
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,052
I just want to finish this
and go home!

346
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,888
We wanna help
you too, Misaki!

347
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,123
Feel free to leave
the recording to me.

348
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,492
Uh, no, we've got plenty of
people, so we're fine.

349
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:36,329
I brought along some props
from the Filmmaking Club.
A sword and a 9 millimeter.

350
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,064
And we've got plenty
of fake blood, too!

351
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,066
Uh, great, but it's not
that kinda story...

352
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,736
[INUYAMA BROTHERS] Master!
Please allow us to help, too!

353
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,138
[SAKURA] Whoa!
[SHIZUKO] You're the Ayuzawa
Cram School, aren't you?

354
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,007
[ICHIROU]
Please cast me as an extra!

355
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,942
I would play an
excellent "Thug A"!

356
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,343
[JIROU]
Then please let me play Thug B!

357
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,778
[SABUROU]
And I'll be Thug C!

358
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:52,846
[SHIROU]
And I'll be Thug D!

359
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,147
[GOROU]
And I'll be Thug E!

360
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,716
No, you've got it all wrong!

361
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,685
Misaki, I'm pretty sure you've
gotta be cursed or something.

362
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,689
You first years probably don't
know cuz you've never met him,

363
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,792
but Shirokawa was a
really incredible guy.

364
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:10,531
He was ridiculously tough,
and once he lost his temper,
he was like an animal.

365
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:14,334
But we were his guys, and he
looked out for us like family.

366
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,136
(chuckling)

367
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,840
If he was so great then why'd
he quit after he left Seisen?

368
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,710
Sounds to me like he's
hiding in the shadows like
a little baby scaredy cat.

369
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,178
[ARATAKE]
Shut your damn mouth!

370
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,313
You guys don't know
anything about him!

371
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,352
You can't handle the
number one spot, can you?

372
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:37,991
[ARATAKE]
Uh?! (growling)
You shut up, too!

373
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,460
Bastard... I've had
enough of your crap!

374
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,296
[MISAKI]
Where's Yukimura?

375
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,398
[AOI]
I don't have the energy
to look for him anymore.

376
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,201
[USUI]
Do we have enough strength
left to save him?

377
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,671
[SHIROKAWA]
Hey, it's over this way.

378
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:56,042
[KONDO]
You're so obsessed with the past
that it's split us all apart!

379
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,044
And just what the hell is
that supposed to mean?!

380
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,514
[KONDO]
Yeah, you've gotten stronger,
and everybody knows it!

381
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,116
But that's not the only thing
that makes a good leader,

382
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,552
you've gotta be more
than a tough guy!

383
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,288
[MISAKI]
We finally made it!

384
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,995
[SHIROKAWA] Whoaa, what
a blast from the past!
[KUROSAKI] Yayyy!

385
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,430
Shirokawa?

386
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,901
[SHIROKAWA]
The sofa and table
are still here!

387
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,704
[KUROSAKI]
Whoa, but it's dirty!
Y'all should clean up a bit!

388
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,406
[SHIROKAWA]
You're the only one here?
Where're the other guys at?

389
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:29,009
You have some guts
to say that to me.

390
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,878
[SHIROKAWA]
This place sure has
gotten lonely, huh? (smack)

391
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,516
Hey, no fighting! Agh!

392
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,917
[USUI]
That's enough, Miss President.

393
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:39,119
[MISAKI]
Usui! Hey! Let me go!

394
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,320
[KUROSAKI] It's all right, Misa.

395
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,888
For the guys here sometimes...

396
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,290
this is the only way they can
say what they wanna say.

397
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,693
This is how they communicate.

398
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,629
[KUROSAKI]
It might look like they're just
fighting with each other,

399
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,798
but to them it's actually
a conversation.

400
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,506
[SHIROKAWA]
Looks like I remember some of
the old moves after all.

401
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,809
Even though it's been awhile
since I've had a good fight.

402
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,813
[SHIROKAWA]
Still, it sure was one hell of a
surprise to fight you.

403
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,583
[SHIROKAWA]
When did you suddenly
get so strong?

404
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:15,889
(chuckle) The hell. Looks
like you're still a big ol'
cry baby though.

405
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,024
[SHIROKAWA]
But you've got resolve.

406
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:22,629
Heh. You didn't really think
you'd be able to hide those
tears from me, did you, buddy?

407
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:27,500
You've gotten a lot bigger since
the last time I saw you‐ you're
taller and your hair's longer,

408
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,170
and with that headband I
didn't recognize you at first.

409
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,906
You remember me...
after so long?

410
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,841
[SHIROKAWA]
Of course. (laughing)

411
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,312
How've you been doin,
ya dumbasses?

412
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:43,650
[ALL]
Sir!

413
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,153
Now do you see?

414
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,221
Yeah...

415
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,090
I can't believe
how easily

416
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,424
you fall in line
for this guy.

417
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,493
He's just an idiot
with a lame nickname.

418
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,629
Kurotatsu, quit
being mean!

419
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:58,331
When I was a first year,
I was so weak...

420
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,701
It made me want to be
strong no matter what.

421
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,837
I took on a group of guys I
didn't stand a chance against,

422
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,407
and just as they were beating
the crap out of me...

423
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,978
A hero came and
saved me from them.

424
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,781
[SHIROKAWA] Hey, get
over here, bastard!
[ARATAKE] And I...

425
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,218
I wanted to be a hero,
too! Just like you!

426
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,989
[SHIROKAWA] You will. Trust me.
[ARATAKE] (crying)

427
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,159
[KUROSAKI]
Shiroyan, don't tell
me you're gonna‐

428
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,894
[SHIROKAWA]
Nah, don't worry about that.

429
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,799
I'm not that idiot who
makes his mom cry anymore.

430
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,235
Plus, we've got our
own stuff to... huh?

431
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:39,673
[SARASHINA] Sob.
[SHIROKAWA] Ah, there he is!
Whatcha doin', Ikkun?

432
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,775
[SARASHINA]
Nothing. Nothing at all.

433
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,810
What's up? Are you
mad at us, Ikkun?

434
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,312
Forget it. You don't have
to worry about me anymore.

435
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,814
What're you saying, dummy?

436
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,816
Don't tell me you forgot
about our important mission?

437
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,118
[SARASHINA] Mission?
[SHIROKAWA] Our special speed
training

438
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,487
to get our photo taken
with Misa, remember?!

439
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,757
[SARASHINA]
Why don't you just go do it with
your other friends?

440
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:59,092
That bandana guy can
take my place and‐

441
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,694
[SHIROKAWA] You dummy!

442
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,663
Ahhhh!

443
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,565
If we don't have you, Ikkun,
there's no way we'll win!

444
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:07,668
But why? You can at least
play poker, can't you?!

445
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,503
[SHIROKAWA]
C'mon, quit arguing about it!

446
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,905
THIS stuff suits me way
more than the old way did.

447
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,440
Wh‐who are all of you?

448
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,677
[ARATAKE]
Are you Shirokawa's
new followers?

449
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,211
[TAHARA]
Where'd you go to junior high?

450
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,412
[KONDO] Are you strong?

451
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:20,814
[AOI] Wait a second...

452
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,883
Why does it seem like things
are getting dangerous?

453
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,851
[USUI]
It's not like they're
picking a fight or anything.

454
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,654
[ARATAKE]
So then Shirokawa's the number
one guy there, too?

455
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,389
[TAHARA]
Has he gotten in any fights?

456
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,324
[USUI]
I guess we can't mention how you
ripped out

457
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,560
Shirokawa's earrings
with your bare hands, huh?

458
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,762
[MISAKI] Gah!
[ARATAKE] Woman,
what did you do?!

459
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,865
[SHIROKAWA]
Hey, you guys,
what're you doing?

460
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,034
[SARASHINA]
That girl isn't just
some punk leader!

461
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,571
[KUROSAKI] That's right! She's
our boss, our goddess! Our maid
and president!

462
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,006
[MISAKI] Ah!
[ARATAKE] A maid?

463
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:48,642
Yes! All who resist her will
be sent to the abyss!

464
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,877
She's earned the nickname
"Misaki from Hell"...

465
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,647
and she is none other than
our student council president!

466
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,917
Got it? So you guys better
show her some more respect!

467
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,319
[KUROSAKI] Bow your heads!

468
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,721
[ALL]
Our apologies, Miss President!

469
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,223
Cut that out,
you three idiots!

470
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,125
[TRIO]
She's mad, she's mad! Nice!

471
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,327
(ARATAKE laughing)

472
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,630
(laughter)

473
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,534
Wait a sec... aren't we
forgetting something?
[ALL] Huh?

474
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:18,739
[YUKIMURA]
(sniffle) I sure am hungry...

475
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:52,465
[USUI]
Today, we got to see a
different side to the
Three Idiots. Okay, done.

476
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,434
[SHIROKAWA]
Whoa, talk about
brushing us aside!

477
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:57,704
[KUROSAKI]
I wouldn't want any of Usui's
compliments anyway. Right,
Shiroyan?

478
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,272
[SARASHINA]
What did you think, Misa?

479
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,107
[MISAKI]
Huh? I didn't really care.

480
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,744
[TRIO] Huh?
[SARASHINA] Maybe next time I,
Ikkun, will get a backstory!

481
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:07,548
[MISAKI] The Three Idiots
aren't even in the next episode,
are they?
[TRIO] Huh?!

482
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:11,518
[MISAKI]
I should know all of Seika's
students, but who's this
suspicious guy wearing a hoodie?

483
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,520
[USUI]
You should be more
careful, Ayuzawa.

484
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,556
[YUKIMURA]
Miss President!
I got free and now I'm back!

485
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,559
[MISAKI]
Oh, sorry, Yukimura.
We forgot about you.
