1
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,197
Quit your whining already!

2
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,199
[MISAKI]
Yukimura, I told you the
deadline for the report

3
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,034
on the school festival
was today, didn't I?

4
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,938
Yes! But Miss President
this is a tremendous
amount of paperwork!

5
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,472
Almost all of the
clubs and classes

6
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,975
turned in their paperwork
at the very last second!

7
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,078
Huh?! There's MORE?!
I can't do it!

8
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,682
[MISAKI]
All right, fine!
Just collect everything,
and I'll do it myself later.

9
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,518
Really?!

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,054
[BOYS]
Oh yeah, check THIS out!

11
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:01,922
Show me some more!

12
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:02,823
Oh yeah!

13
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,658
I can't take it!

14
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,292
(Grunt)

15
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,861
[MISAKI]
What's that sound?

16
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,663
What's going on
over there?

17
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,531
Huh? Uh...

18
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,064
(Boys chatter)

19
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:11,898
Shh...

20
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,534
(Boys excited)

21
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,868
Shh!

22
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,436
Whoa! Wow!

23
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,872
Those idiots, who have no
concern for their own lives,

24
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,109
wouldn't happen to be looking at
something innappropriate
while I'm away, would they?

25
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,579
Make sure to tell them this:

26
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,317
"Prepare to be punished."

27
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,257
[USUI]
That won't do, Madam President.

28
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,792
"Prepare to be punished"?

29
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,127
Sounds a little suggestive.
They might get the wrong idea.

30
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,729
When did you get here?!

31
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,464
And don't just barge into
the dressing room like that!

32
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,534
A certain someone left
the door open. How careless.

33
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,135
Why you...

34
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,605
Oh, my! Back again
so soon, Usui?

35
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,239
What's in the
box, ma'am?

36
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,910
Oh, nothing!
Just a few essentials...

37
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
[MISAKI]
Personal protection items?

38
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,480
What? You mean you haven't
heard about the stalkers

39
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,116
who've been going after girls
who work at cosplay cafes?

40
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,653
Seems like it keeps happening
more and more, so I picked
these up just in case.

41
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,823
Well, I'm sure none of
our customers would do
anything like that,

42
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,093
but make sure to carry one
just in case, okay, Misa?

43
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,595
Here.

44
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,196
Uh, you can just give it
to one of the other girls.

45
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,631
I'll take whatever's left.

46
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,600
In fact, I really don't
need one at all‐

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,536
You think you don't
need one because you're
strong or something?

48
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,737
[Grunt]

49
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,138
Oh, that's right!

50
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,107
You know how to do
aikido, don't you?

51
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,977
Right. Besides, I doubt anyone
would try and wait around
for me to leave.

52
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,447
And even if they did,
I'd just take them out!
(giggle)

53
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,719
[SATSUKI]
You sure are tough, Misa!
(giggle)

54
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,091
[KUROSAKI]
Oh. The stalking incidents, huh?

55
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,894
[SARASHINA]
They've been targeting
cosplay coffee shops, right?

56
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,129
I saw it on the news.

57
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,597
What a bunch of losers.

58
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,132
Don't they have
anything else to do?

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,434
Do you think
Misa'll be all right?

60
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,369
I dunno...

61
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,371
[ALL]
Ah! I'm so worried!

62
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,874
What if something
happens to Misa?!

63
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,177
All right. That just means WE'LL
have to protect her, right?

64
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,412
But Misa's already
really tough!

65
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,881
And she knows aikido!

66
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,783
She's way tougher than we are!

67
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,652
She'll be JUST FINE!

68
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,120
Well then, shall we
stop by today?

69
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,355
Maid Latte
here we come!

70
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,190
I can't wait to
see our Misa!

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,692
Ah!

72
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,694
Waah!

73
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,397
President, please
go easy on them...

74
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,868
Are these all of the idiots
who were making a scene in
the student council room?!

75
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,335
Yes.

76
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,738
President... have mercy...

77
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,342
Next time you want to hang
around in the student council
room looking at dirty pictures,

78
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,144
just go home and study instead!

79
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,212

Bleh!

Is he trying to piss me off?!

Fine, just do whatever the
hell you want! Stupid Usui!

20 yen. How 'bout

[KUROSAKI]
I've got
15 whole yen!

00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,627
So, how much would
we have if we added
it all together?

93
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,229
Let's see...
about 115 yen, right?

94
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,899
Huh? We can't
even get a cup of
coffee with that!

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,336
[SHIROKAWA]
Guess we'll just give up
and go home.

Ma'am! Thank you very much!

No problem.
Good work, Yukimura.

Geez, it sure is late.

Oh really...?

Huh? Misaki!
You stayed late, too?

00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,767
Yay, come study with me!

115

[MISAKI]
Huh? You were doing your
homework at school? Why?

116
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,339
It's way easier for me
to concentrate there!

117
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,543
It's not safe for you to be
out alone this late at night.

118
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,178
You never know what kind of
weirdos are hanging around.

Yes, Ma'am.

Thanks for seeing me off!

more careful...

It's not safe for
you to be out alone
this late at night.

Oh, allow me to
get you another one.

Have a good night.

The boss sure is
late isn't she?

144
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,394
She's stuck at one of her
Mall Committee meetings.

145
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,729
They always run long.

146
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,898
Hm... but why today
of all days?

147
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,867
What's wrong?
Do you have something
you need to do, Erika?

148
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,004
I have a ton of assignments,
and they're ALL due tomorrow!

00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,973
Ugh, I don't think
I can do it...!

150
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,342
Huh? Don't you
have to leave, too?

151
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,313
Yeah. I have another
shift at my second job
at the cabaret.

152
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,116
No way!
You work too hard!

153
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,918
Don't worry about it.
Huh?

154
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,654
The two of you just go ahead
and leave if you need to.

155
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,723
I'll stay and cover for you
until the boss gets back.

156
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,090
You sure, you really don't mind?

157
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,059
I'll be fine!
Just leave it to me.

158
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,228
Thanks for helping
us out, Misa.

159
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,831
But I'm a bit worried
about leaving you
here all alone.

160
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,900
Especially with all of
those incidents that've
happened recently...

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,701
Yeah.

162
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,902
Don't worry you two.

163
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,738
Even if some weirdo
does show up,

164
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,540
I'll make him wish he'd
picked another cafÃ©!

165
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,407
You'll really be okay?

166
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,509
Yep!

167
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,110
Well, if you
really don't mind...

168
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,546
We owe you one!

169
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,785
Now to make sure everything's
properly locked up...

170
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,603
(Locking door)

171
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,714
(Muffled struggling)

172
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,383
This is the weirdo
the boss mentioned!

173
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,052
And he's pretty strong, too!

174
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,057
(Muffled struggling)

175
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,506
What the hell are
you doing, Usui?

176
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,140
I'm playin' stalker.

177
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,744
Well guess what, Mr. Stalker,
playtime's about to be over...

178
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,412
Is this the end?

179
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,948
(exasperated sigh)
Seriously, Usui?

180
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,684
Quit messing around‐ any normal
girl would've sued you for that.

181
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,985
I'll keep that in mind.

182
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,021
By the way, the back
door was unlocked.

183
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,625
Miss President, you need to be a
bit more cautious in the future.

184
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,892
Huh?

185
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,594
You're at ease
because you're tough,

186
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,395
but you should remember...

187
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,502
You are still a girl, after all.

188
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,037
Uh?

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,208
Let go!

190
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,344
Why do you always take
your jokes too far?

191
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,080
And who do you think you are,
giving me warnings?

192
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,083
I don't need you
to tell me what to do!

193
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,023
Just leave.

194
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,992
Hm.

195
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,696
See ya.

196
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,974
That girl... she just
doesn't get it, does she?

197
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,906
[SUZUNA]
Wow. So many fancy cakes...

198
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,307
Weren't these expensive?

199
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,610
Did you go on a cake
spending spree? I approve!

200
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,178
No, I kept an eye on the store
today while the manager was out.

201
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,847
When she came back,
she brought these and said:

202
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,949
I'm sorry I was gone so long!

203
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,918
Please take these
and enjoy them.

204
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,219
And now they're ours!

205
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,021
Hmm...

206
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,426
That damn Usui‐ why doesn't he
just mind his own business?

207
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,128
I can take care of myself!

208
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,163
But, I guess complaining
about it won't solve
anything, now will it?

209
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,432
This one's for Mom.
This one is for
breakfast tomorrow.

210
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,368
Oh! This cake tastes amazing!
I wonder where the boss
bought them?

211
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,371
This one's for a snack...
But I can't decide which
one to eat right now.

212
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,743
Suzuna, you can have
whichever one you want.
They're delicious!

213
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,278
We should make some tea
to go with it, too!

214
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,813
Good idea.

215
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,615
We have a "Mysterious
Teas of the World" set

216
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,283
that I won
in a giveaway.

217
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,252
Yeah, that sounds great!

218
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,922
(School bell)

219
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,091
[BOY]
So, you wanna go somewhere
on the way back?

220
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,594
[OTHER BOY]
Sorry, I can't.
I'm broke.

221
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:41,862
I hear that.

222
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,271
[MISAKI]
See you next time, Master.

223
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,342
Have you decided on
your order, Masters?

224
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,546
Uh, I'd like a Cutesy Cutesy
Omelette and and iced coffee.

225
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,048
[HONOKA]
Right away.
One Cutesy Cutesy Omelette...

226
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,449
[MISAKI]
It's so peaceful.

227
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,853
Without Usui around,
everything seems so relaxed.

228
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,757
(Glass breaks)

229
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,559
[Customer]
Oh!

230
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,160
I‐I'm sorry!

231
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,962
I hit it with
my arm...

232
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,899
Oh, I'm very sorry.
Are you injured, Master?

233
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,567
N‐no ma'am.

234
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,169
I will return shortly with
something to wipe this up.

235
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,974
Wait, let me‐

236
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:29,943
Huh?

237
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,278
It's dangerous.

238
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,115
O‐okay.

239
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,954
Sure enough, Misa's the
perfect choice, isn't she?

240
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,757
I don't think I can
hold back anymore.

241
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,458
Me either.

242
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,936
[NEWSCASTER]
Last night, a young woman
was assaulted at a
local coffee shop.

243
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,238
The store was a
"cosplay" coffee shop.

244
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,406
The assailant waited till
the shop had closed,

245
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,144
and is thought to have
entered from the rear door.

246
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,846
[GIRL]
Hey, sweetcheeks!

247
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,113
Hmm?

248
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,182
You free? Wanna have
some fun with us?

249
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,017
Say, you're pretty young.

250
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,386
Are you a high
school student...?

251
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,223
Huh?
Hey, wait!

252
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:19,893
Damn. This sucks.

253
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,628
And he was cute, too!

254
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,500
Okay, that's it for
the cleaning.

255
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,838
(Locks door)
The boss has her own key.

256
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,707
Better safe than
sorry, I guess...

257
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:38,011
I can't believe
I've got ANOTHER Mall
Committee meeting tonight!

258
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,479
They hold them all
in one month,

259
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,848
regular meetings as
well as idea exchanges

260
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,784
and financial
advisory meetings.

261
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,052
I even have to submit
my account ledgers!

262
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,421
It's such a huge pain
in the you‐know‐what!

263
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,824
Now the Mall Committee
Chair is like, "We need
a cutesy character"

264
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,460
and keeps shoving this weird
mascot character thing
into our faces.

265
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,629
I don't know what to do!

266
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,297
Maybe I should write
a song about it!

267
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,465
(Singing)
Mall committees are so stupid!

268
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,335
Anyway, I promise you'll never
ever have to watch the store
all by yourself again

269
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,405
if you'll just keep an eye
on it for one more night!
Pretty please?!

270
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,107
Once I'm done I'll race back
here at the speed of light

271
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,775
and I'll even bring you a snack!

272
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,810
I'm sorry!

273
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,212
I‐it's all right, ma'am.

274
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,283
Well, I don't really think I've
got anything to worry about...

275
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,019
Hm?

276
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,694
Ow! This could really
do some damage.

277
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,829

00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,102
Ma'am? Huh?

280
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,640
I could've sworn I heard
the door being unlocked...

281
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,176
(Gasp)

282
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,078
Misa...

283
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,681
We let ourselves in.
I hope you don't mind

284
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,982
Don't move!

00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,656

00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,040
(Creepy laughing)
We finally got you, Misa...

288
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,877
Just sit there
like a good girl, okay?

289
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,079
I don't wanna
have to get ugly.

290
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,815
That's right.

You're the

this entire time,

and talked to other guys.

But we know the truth‐

you don't want anything

[THIN STALKER]
We're not like

00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:24,871
Oh, boy.

318
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,775
The boss is going to faint
when she sees this.

319
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,613
The back door was locked.
I had no choice.

320
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,816
[Stalkers sobbing]

321
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,718
[BOTH]
We're so sorry.

322
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,820
So tell me something.

323
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,658
What kind of person did you two
imagine that Misa really was?

324
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,326
I'm curious.

325
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:49,730
[THIN STALKER]
W‐well, we thought that
even though she's a maid,

326
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,298
she's really a sadist.

327
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,400
[FAT STALKER]
That's why we wanted her,

328
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,803
uh, we wanted her to
punish us severely.

329
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,138
Gah!

330
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:02,175
Oh. So you guys are
masochists, then?

331
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,610
Yeah, well...

332
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,378
Most definitely.

333
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,617
Hate to break it to you

334
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,987
but this cute little maid
belongs to me and me alone.

335
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,856
So hands off, got it?

336
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,027
Usui! You son of a...

337
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,564
I'm not your damn pet!

338
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,673
Get a move on.

339
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,552
Uh, it's just...
it'a just...!

340
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,653
You know...

341
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,123
It's only right to say
what should be said...

342
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,192
I mean... I...

343
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,296
Usui...

344
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,965
Umm... Thank you.

345
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:10,711
[SATSUKI]
Misa! I'm sorry
I'm back so late!

346
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,347
Oh, Usui!
You're here, too how nice!

347
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,551
Welcome back, ma'am...
but uhm‐

348
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:20,787
Were you two lovebirds
gazing into each other's
eyes right now?

349
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,155
Sorry for interrupting.

350
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,024
I should've taken
my time coming back.

351
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,391
Sorry, I'm not the most
observant woman.

352
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,960
Please don't say
things like that...

353
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,062
Huh? What is it, Usui?

354
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,564
You want me to look up...?

355
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,700
Oh, no!

356
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,670
What on Earth
happened here?

357
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,704
Sorry, ma'am.

358
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:38,539
The truth is...

359
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,707
(Fainting)
Manager!

360
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,879
So, did you cry for help?

361
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,114
"Eek, save me!"

362
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,716
Like a damsel in distress?

363
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,352
No, I taught them a lesson
they'll never forget.

364
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,820
I knew it.

365
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,488
The most important thing
is that you weren't hurt.

366
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,991
Don't ever be
so reckless again!

367
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,292
(Sigh)
Sorry guys.

368
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,461
I didn't mean
to make you worry.

369
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:05,398
But never fear‐ I'll make sure
to be even stronger next time!

370
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,702
Well, I guess that's
our Misaki for you.

371
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,137
She's already preparing
for her next battle.

372
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,073
(Awkward laugh)

373
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:16,342
The real question is why you'd
want to be stronger
than you are now.

374
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,211
O‐kay! Here.

375
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,280
I changed your
background picture.

376
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,583
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

377
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,154
Ah!

378
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,423
Wh‐when did you...?!

379
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,325
Wait a minute‐
who took this?!

380
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,594
Oh that would be me!

381
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,428
"If it's cute it has to be
loved by all,"

382
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,531
that's what our manager
always says, right?

383
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,333
She took enough pictures to
fill up her entire memory card.

384
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,568
Lemme see!

385
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,304
No way!
Let me see,
let me see!

386
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,140
Hey!
She's so cute!

387
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,341
Don't look, Usui!

388
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,143
Hey, that's no fair.
I want one.

389
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,545
Well...

390
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,613
Tah‐dah!

391
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,480
I happen to have
that photo saved, too.

392
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:55,682
Th‐this isn't funny‐!

393
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:56,850
Whoa. Gimme.

394
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,652
No, don't send him that!

395
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,823
Wait a second! How do I‐
How do I change this?

396
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,260
I can't have this
as my background!

397
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,730
I'll be too embarassed
to even use my phone!

398
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,364
What do I do?

399
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:14,167
But if I told you how to do it,
then it wouldn't be any fun,
now would it?!

400
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,769
And sent.

401
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:16,670
Cut it out, dammit!

402
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,704
Got it.

403
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,472
(Misaki crying)

404
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,734
[SUZUNA]
Misaki, those cakes
were delicious.

405
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,069
Tell your boss
I really enjoyed them.

406
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,640
I get the feeling Mom and I
will have plenty of cakes
coming our way soon.

407
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,441
[MISAKI]
Well you can't just
expect that‐

408
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:05,345
[USUI]
Miss President! I've got plenty
of Maid Latte points saved up.

409
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,748
[MISAKI]
You're there too often, Usui!

410
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,750
[USUI]
Let's take a picture
together, okay?

411
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,185
[MISAKI]
First, you'll have to
beat me at a game!

412
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,687
[USUI]
Oh, Miss President!

413
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,288
Next time you'll
get some disciples

414
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,590
who'll call you "Master."

415
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,225
[MISAKI]
What are you talking about?!
