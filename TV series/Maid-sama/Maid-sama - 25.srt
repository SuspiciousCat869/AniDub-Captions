1
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,133
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Geez! Why did you say you
didn't want anyone to come?

2
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,803
And now you're all sulky...

3
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,406
The truth is, you wanted
us all to send you off,
didn't you, Yoh?

4
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:50,777
(sigh) You really are
hopeless, you know that?

5
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,747
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Here. This is for you.

6
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,150
So... don't make that
face anymore, got it!

7
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,254
I want you to take care
of yourself, okay, Yoh!

8
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,791
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Yoh...

9
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,791
Bet you thought it was morning,
but school's already ended.
(chuckling)

10
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,960
[BOY A]
She sure was scary
again today, huh?

11
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,628
[BOY B]
Who, the demon president?

12
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,197
She didn't have to go off like
that just cuz he ate lunch
early.

13
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,368
[BOY A] Even the
teacher got scared.
[MISAKI] Shintani! What are you
already getting into your lunch

14
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,036
It's still first period!

15
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,006
[BOY A]
Hinata, doesn't it scare you
to get yelled at like that?

16
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,809
Huh? Why would it,
it's just Misaki.

17
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,143
Huh?

18
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,479
[MISAKI] Those guys in
the exercise club again?

19
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,315
I've WARNED them about tracking
mud inside the school building.

20
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,085
Crap... Everyone hide!

21
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,286
[BOY A]
Look!

22
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,592
[BOY A]
The demon is summoning her
minions...

23
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,364
(sigh) Oh dear, I've worked
up quite a sweat.

24
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,300
[SHINTANI] Oh it's Misaki...
(Boys running in fear)

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,303
[BOY B] Let's go! If the demon
catches us, we'll be taken
straight to hell!

26
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,205
[SHINTANI] Misaki!

27
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,941
[BOY B]
Dude, you've gotta tell me:

28
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,442
What the heck do you see in her?

29
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,111
[BOY C]
I've heard rumors she used
to be better before,

30
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,412
but now she's like THAT.

31
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,716
[DEMONIC MISAKI]
Where are the bad boys?

32
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,319
Huh, well now that
you mention it,

33
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,454
I think she used to talk
a little differently...

34
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,924
[SHINTANI] But she's
still as kind as ever!
[MISAKI] I'm confiscating
those bread crusts!

35
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,125
[BOYS]
Like how?!

36
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,459
Well, she always
treats me special!

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,561
She's always been nice!

38
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:48,862
[BOY A]
He's a masochist?

39
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,096
[BOY B]
A total masochist.

40
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,464
[SHINTANI]
But y'know...

41
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,834
Misaki has always
been herself...

42
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,037
[SHINTANI]
I haven't ever changed
how I feel about her.

43
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,639
[BOY A]
Hinata...

44
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,845
Yeah... I've always known I
couldn't have... anyone but her.

45
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,019
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Hey!

46
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,454
[YOUNG SHINTANI] AH!

47
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,723
Whaddya think you're doin'
in those clothes, boy?!

48
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,192
Your gonna get yer
new uniform all dirty!

49
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,861
Jeez!

50
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,903
[GRANDPA]
What's wrong, Hinata?
Why the long face

51
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,676
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Hey! You can't do that, Yoh!

52
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,844
Nothin'.

53
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,448
[GRANDMA]
How was your day
at school, dear?

54
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,384
[SHINTANI]
There's a whole bunch
more people now.

55
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,820
Well I hope you make
yourself lots of friends.

56
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,657
[GRANDPA]
Time sure does fly...
You're already in middle
school, ain't ya?

57
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,827
[GRANDMA]
That's right. You're turnin'
into a splendid young man.

58
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,328
Thanks for the food.

59
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,632
[GRANDMA]
We worried 'bout ya every day
when you first came here.

60
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,235
And you was so chubby, but
you gotten skinnier and
skinnier every day.

61
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,070
That's cuz all you feed
me is vegetables.

62
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,172
Now don't be an idjit, Hinata!

63
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,841
We gave ya meat but
you didn't eat it.

64
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,476
You said you was fine, but
we could tell different.

65
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,546
[GRANDMA]
Thank goodness
you've gotten better.

66
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,114
(embarrassed) Hmmm...

67
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,583
(Baseball getting hit)
(Girls cheering)

68
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,825
[UMPIRE]
Safe!

69
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,527
[SHINTANI] Phew!

70
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,629
[BOY A]
You sure have gotten fast, huh?

71
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,231
Even though ya still don't have
any meat on your bones.

72
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,399
But I been workin' out 24‐7...

73
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,970
(Girls squealing and
cheering for Shintani)

74
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,706
[BOY B]
Golly Hinata, you sure are
popular with the ladies...

75
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,743
[BOY A]
That's cuz he's the star player,
he gets all the ladies.

76
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,612
[BOY C]
Dangit! Even though he's such
an idiot?! I'm so jealous!

77
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,085
[SHINTANI]
But I... I just don't...

78
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,658
(surprised gasp)

79
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:08,001
[SHINTANI]
That's right...
Today's Valentine's Day.

80
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,045
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Here. This is for you.

81
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,048
Take care of
yourself, okay, Yoh!

82
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,687
(exhale)

83
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,402
[SHINTANI]
Okay, right this way please!

84
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,105
[MISAKI] Huh?
A Yumemishi concert?

85
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,509
Yup! They'll be playing at
the Yumesaki High School's
cultural festival!

86
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,277
Have you forgotten about how
that jerk treated you the last
time we saw him?!

87
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,981
That's exactly right.
Please talk some sense
into her, Misaki.

88
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,352
But Kuuga's changed a lot
since the last time you saw
him...! He really has...

89
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,123
[SHIZUKO]
Apparently, he got hurt during
what Sakura intended to be her
final concert,

90
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,860
and this "change" occurred
when she constantly visited
him in the hospital.

91
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,796
[MISAKI] Hey, dammit!
[SHIZUKO] Dammit...

92
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,600
[MISAKI, SHIZUKO]
Dammit, Dammit!

93
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,769
[SAKURA]
I'm sorry! But... But I...

94
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,971
I only wanted you guys to see
with your own eyes

95
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,974
how much he has really
changed, afterall!

96
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,612
Uh... All right, fine.

97
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,148
[USUI] I want to go, too.
[MISAKI] Huh?! Usui!

98
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,517
I want to go to Yumesaki's
cultural festival, too.

99
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,519
What do YOU want to come for?

100
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,659
[SAKURA]
Aw c'mon, Misaki!

101
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,761
[SHIZUKO]
You can't leave him all
alone, can you Misaki?

102
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,029
He's not some little kid...

103
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,702
Misaki, your face is quite red.

104
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,937
[SAKURA]
You're all warm, too!

105
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,611
[MAIDS]
Welcome back, Masters.

106
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:04,017
[ERIKA]
Eriiii‐calyyyy... Eri‐calypso!

107
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,519
Please, have a seat.

108
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,687
[TRIO]
Okay!

109
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,354
Miss Erika, tell me my future!

110
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,389
Will Misa and I‐

111
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,190
Misa and I‐!

112
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,191
Misa and I‐!

113
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,458
Become involved?!

114
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,594
Very well.

115
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,261
I shall now look
into the globe and

116
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,297
predict your futures with Misa!

117
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:21,702
[ERIKA] Pasahr... Rusoraono...

118
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,738
[ERIKA] Eriiii‐carbornara!
[TRIO] Nervous... So nervous...

119
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:29,976
[SATSUKI] Hmm. After the shrine
maiden fortune‐telling event
went over so well.

120
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,613
I thought the crystal ball
would be perfect.

121
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,047
But Manager, take a look:

122
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:38,451
although her technique is
strange she has them completely
captivated.

123
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,420
[SUBARU] They're
practically spellbound.
[SAYU] [GON‐CHAN] Viva, viva,
hey! Viva, viva, hey!

124
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,388
[ERIKA]
Bravo! Eri‐caly, come on!

125
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,390
(Chanting continues)

126
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,192
[TRIO]
So nervous...

127
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,662
[ERIKA]
There it is! It's...!

128
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,696
What is it?

129
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,797
My heart's racing!

130
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,232
I'm stimulated beyond belief!

131
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,134
(Erika lets out
a cry of despair)
(Trio startled)

132
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,536
Hmmm, I see nothing‐

133
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,470
my crystal is blank like
the mind of a simpleton.

134
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,772
[SHIROKAWA] Huh?
[SARASHINA] What does that mean?

135
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,406
[KUROSAKI]
Is it broken or something?

136
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,808
I see nothing! Nothing at all!

137
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,577
In other words... Gentlemen.

138
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,378
You have no future whatsoever!

139
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,214
It means "It will never
work out between you,
so just give up now."

140
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,517
So sayeth the all‐knowingest
crystal ball.

141
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,385
[TRIO]
You didn't have to be
so blunt about it!

142
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,388
Telling fortunes requires
a certain level of human
observation.

143
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,059
So it would be impossible
for someone like you, Misa.
[MISAKI] Huh?

144
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,029
(forced laugh) I mean,
you can't even figure your OWN
feelings out, can you?

145
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,000
[BOTH]
Hello, welcome back, Master!

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,370
Hey Misaki‐ Oops! I forgot
that she's "Misa" here.

147
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,473
But just calling her "Misa"
is so embarrassing! (giggling)

148
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,710
[MISAKI]
Shintani... You've already
turned into a regular customer.

149
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,314
Oh yeah! It said there was
"Fortune‐Telling" out front.
Can I get my fortune told, too?

150
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,416
[MISAKI]
Oh, of course, Master.

151
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:47,153
Now then, Master, would you
please have a seat in front of
the all‐knowing crystal ball.

152
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,089
[SHINTANI]
This is just like
the real thing!

153
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,824
[SHINTANI]
Can you tell me my
future with Misa?

154
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,492
[ERIKA]
Are you ready?

155
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:57,731
[ERIKA]
Bashar... rusoraono,
Eri‐cardamom!

156
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,665
(Noise deflating)

157
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,566
[ERIKA]
I saw it.

158
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,601
What did you see?!

159
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:01,768
A paper boat...

160
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,169
[SHINTANI]
A paper boat and‐?

161
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,370
...it was sinking.

162
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,773
[SHINTANI]
Huh?!

163
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,675
[KUROSAKI] What a loser.
[SHIROKAWA] Didja hear that‐

164
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,310
His relationship with Misa
is a sinking paper boat.

165
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,613
[SARASHINA] Not having a future
with her is better than that!

166
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:17,183
L‐Look again! There's not a hole
in it or anything, right? C'mon
just look one more time!

167
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,920
[KUROSAKI] What's this?
[SARASHINA] Looks like
someone's in denial.
(laughter)

168
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,122
[ERIKA]
Uhm, well, I didn't
see a hole...

169
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,423
Thank goodness!

170
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,659
As long as there's not a hole,
it can pop right back up!

171
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,661
[TRIO]
So positive!

172
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,195
[ERIKA] Bonus!
[SHINTANI] Oh?

173
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,098
If you can keep your positivity
you may be able to bring

174
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,901
the paper boat back to the
surface of the waters of love...

175
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,737
You might just be able
to change your fortune.

176
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,271
You really mean it?!

177
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,207
Yahoo!

178
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,345
[USUI]
(sigh) In that case... would
you mind telling MY future
with Misa, too?

179
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,212
[MISAKI] Gahah!

180
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,948
(Dogs growling)

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,152
[SATSUKI]
Is it just my imagination
or are there dogs in here?

182
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,855
Very well. I shall now
tell your fortune.

183
00:10:54,955 --> 00:11:06,432
Tota eusoraono,
Eh‐ri‐chamomiiiiile!
(chanting noises) HA!

184
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,168
[ERIKA]
Hmph... uhhhh...

185
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,037
[MISAKI]
She's totally avoiding
eye contact!

186
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,739
[USUI]
What does the reading say?

187
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,376
Uh, well... Um, it, uh... heh...

188
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,344
[USUI]
Please be totally honest.

189
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,446
I see. Very well...

190
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:26,119
For you two, there is...
no future at all!

191
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,988
[BOTH]
Shock...

192
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:33,126
[ERIKA]
The crystal ball sees fire and
water. You two have the worst of
compatibility.

193
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,062
[ERIKA]
Neither one of you can accept
the other!

194
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,363
[SHINTANI] Hmm?

195
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,133
However, if you wish to continue
being with each other,

196
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,335
you will have to attempt the
great challenge that awaits.

197
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,438
Or else your future is
doomed for certain failure.

198
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,580
[KUROSAKI]
Huh? But she didn't have
anything to say about US?

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,649
[SHIROKAWA]
Can't she do some kind of
follow‐up or something?

200
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,018
[SARASHINA]
Please, Oh wise Erika!

201
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,653
[TRIO]
We should probably get outta
here.

202
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,054
We'll just be on our way...

203
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:01,888
Don't mind us!

204
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,189
[MISAKI]
See you tomorrow.

205
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,959
[SATSUKI]
Oh, bye, Misa‐ good work today!

206
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,662
[MISAKI]
Uh? You waited for me?

207
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,599
That bottomless pit Sanshita was
hanging around for a while, too.

208
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,234
But he finally left.

209
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,168
[MISAKI]
Huh...

210
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,036
That bother you?

211
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,538
[MISAKI]
Why should it?!

212
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:18,872
There may be some unexpected

213
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,174
"turn of events" awaiting you,
Ayuzawa.

214
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,678
That is if Mr. Sanshita hits
a winning homerun from behind.

215
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,747
[MISAKI] Hey!
[USUI] I see.

216
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,915
Our compatibility was just
that terrible, was it?

217
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:33,486
Wait a minute, Usui! Don't tell
me you actually believe any of
that fortune‐telling crap!

218
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,957
[USUI]
Is that why you're so cold
towards me, Misa?

219
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,159
No, that's because you're
a perverted freak.

220
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,695
[USUI]
It must be our COMPATIBILITY
that makes you say that.

221
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,063
Are you some kind of idiot?

222
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,998
[USUI]
Fire and water can never be
together...

223
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,800
What, so you're saying you plan
to give up on me

224
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,335
over something
stupid like this?

225
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,004
[MISAKI] Uh...

226
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:56,309
[MISAKI]
Uh, th‐that is... I mean...

227
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,419
[MISAKI]
I swear, the next time
I see those guys

228
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,455
they're gonna wish they'd
never exercised in their life!

229
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,824
[SHINTANI] Oh?

230
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,026
What, so you're saying you
plan to give up on me

231
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,028
over something stupid like this?

232
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,337
[SHINTANI]
Let me give you a hand,
Misaki, whaddya say?!

233
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,839
Shintani...

234
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,142
This floor sure is a mess, huh?

235
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,811
Yoh, you have to help with
the cleaning, too!

236
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,146
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
I am!

237
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,482
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Geez! You're such a bad liar!

238
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,483
(Misaki giggles)

239
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,985
Uh? I‐is something wrong?

240
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,921
[MISAKI]
No. You've just really...

241
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,491
Thank you. You're
a big help, Shintani.

242
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:25,298
O‐Oh really?! I'm g‐g‐glad!
I'll do my best! My total
best! My best!

243
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,067
[MISAKI]
Shintani? What's with you?

244
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,636
N‐N‐N‐Nothing at all!
I'll go get some more water!

245
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,304
What, already?

246
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,611
[SHINTANI]
Ah... She was just so cute I
thought I was gonna die! Huh?

247
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,015
[SHINTANI]
Misaki! Misaki!

248
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,550
Wouldn't it be faster
if we use this?

249
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,252
Oh, the hose? I wonder if it
will reach from over there.

250
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,222
[SHINTANI]
Well, if you push down on the
end like this...!

251
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,090
[MISAKI] Oh...

252
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,491
[SHINTANI]
Waaaaugh!

253
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:53,660
Idiot! Didn't you put on
the hose securely first?

254
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,730
It's freezing! Why are you
plugging it with your hand?!
Just turn the faucet off!

255
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,599
Uh... Which way does
it turn again?

256
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,603
(angry) Look, just move! Quit
trying to plug it with your
hands, stupid!

257
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,207
[SHINTANI]
Uh... I‐I'm sorry, Misaki...!

258
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,843
What are you doing? Isn't it
a little cold to take a swim.

259
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,144
[MISAKI]
Usui, you again?

260
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,946
You should change
before you catch a cold.

261
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,348
But if you really want to play
in the water that bad, I won't
stop you.

262
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,118
[MISAKI]
Shut up. Hey, Shintani, do you
have any spare clothes?

263
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,586
[SHINTANI]
oh yeah, I have a pullover.

264
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,888
Hurry up and change and then
head straight home, okay?

265
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:22,823
[SHINTANI]
What about you Misaki?

266
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,025
[MISAKI]
I'll go to the nurse's office
and figure something out.

267
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,793
Later‐ You hurry up and go, too.

268
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,695
[USUI]
(sigh) Just a moment, President.

269
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,996
[MISAKI]
Huh?

270
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,732
[USUI]
You plan to walk
around like that?

271
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:32,999
Yeah. I'm going to
go around outside

272
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,668
so I don't get any water
in the halls.

273
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,469
[USUI]
That's not what I meant.

274
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,341
Uh... What's the big deal?
It's not like my underwear
is showing.

275
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,811
[USUI]
Hmm. What do you think, blushing
man over there?

276
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,146
[SHINTANI]
Gah!

277
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,682
What are you blushing
like a schoolgirl for?

278
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,653
You really shouldn't be so
careless, Miss President.
It's dangerous.

279
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,598
[MISAKI]
Look, this isn't necessary!

280
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,467
[USUI] If you don't wear this,
I'll walk around naked.
[MISAKI] What?!

281
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,036
[USUI]
So you don't mind if I get
naked and dance in front of
the entire school?

282
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,106
[MISAKI]
Ah! Okay, fine, just don't
strip! You pervert!

283
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,052
[MISAKI]
Fine, I'm going, I'm going!

284
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,528
[USUI]
Woof!

285
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,996
[SHINTANI] Hrm?

286
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,099
[MISAKI]
What did you say "woof" for?

287
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,367
[USUI]
I just felt like it.
Now you try saying "meow."

288
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,436
[MISAKI]
Wha? What is wrong with you?

289
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,638
(Struggled grunts)

290
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,052
Woof!

291
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,393
[SHINTANI]
A boyfriend?

292
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,462
[BOY A]
Yeah. Don't ya think
she's got one already?

293
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,633
[BOY B]
Especially if she's as much of
total cutie like you say she is.

294
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,336
[BOY A]
Maybe she's gotten all fat and
ugly‐ then you'd have nothin' to
worry about!

295
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,672
[SHINTANI]
Misaki would be cute
even if she got fat!

296
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,241
[BOY A]
Then I bet she's definitely
got a boyfriend.

297
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,544
[BOY A]
You haven't thought
about that already?

298
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,146
Don't be stupid, man.
We're almost in high school.

299
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,715
[BOY B]
Y'know them city girls,
even in middle school...

300
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,952
[BOY A]
But especially in high
school, they go for a
little this and that...

301
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,820
[SHINTANI]
What? A little what?!

302
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,226
[BOY C]
What're you lookin' so
traumatized for?

303
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,630
[BOY A]
You should see the little black
book I found in my old sis's
room.

304
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,933
She plays around with guys
and juggles'em like you
wouldn't believe.

305
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,369
[SHINTANI]
Misaki would never do that kinda
thing, she's still pure,

306
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,271
she's not like those
other girls at all!

307
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,340
[BOY C]
Look, just lay off the
middle‐schooler and let
him have his dream!

308
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,845
[BOY A]
But don't you think it's 'bout
time he grew up and faced the
cold hard facts of life?

309
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,515
[BOY C]
True, I do worry about
him not facin' reality.

310
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:05,485
'Specially since he won't let go
of the candy wrapper he got from
her when they said goodbye.

311
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,988
[SHINTANI] How do
you know that?!
[BOY C] You know what he did?

312
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,957
He took the matching good luck
charm we baseball club members
got,

313
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,928
opened it, and put that
wrapper inside instead.
[BOYS] What?!

314
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,831
[BOY A]
So you're why we lost those two
summer games?! Dangit, Hinata!

315
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,534
[SHINTANI]
You idiot, this is why we got
to the finals!

316
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:21,635
[BOY B]
You suck!

317
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,970
[BOY C] In the end,
that doesn't matter...

318
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,872
[Boy C] Hinata.
[SHINTANI] Huh?

319
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,875
I know you've got your heart
set on going to high school
with her, but...

320
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,513
If you keep your hopes too high
you could lose your place to
fall back on.

321
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,182
[BOY C] If you're prepared
for that, then go.

322
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,257
[SHINTANI]
I thought I was prepared but...

323
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,599
It sure is rough.

324
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,145
[SHINTANI]
I'd rather have Misaki get mad
at me for not knowin' when to
quit...

325
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:08,248
Then give up on her
without tryin' at all.

326
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:19,860
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
A few days later, the weather is
quite goo‐‐ Whoa, look out!

327
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,394
[YUKIMURA]
Hey, Kanou!

328
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,229
[YUKIMURA]
Were you waiting long?

329
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,665
[KANOU]
No, I wasn't waiting too long.

330
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,466
[YUKIMURA]
I heard that Yumesaki's school
festival

331
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,868
is supposed to be incredible.

332
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:28,969
[KANOU]
Indeed.

333
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,637
[AOI] Huh?
[KANOU] Huh?

334
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,838
[YUKIMURA]
AOI!

335
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,306
[AOI]
Perfect timing.

336
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,275
I came to take that shot of me
in front of the water

337
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,210
that I couldn't do last time.

338
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,380
[AOI]
You two are free, right? Here,
hold this, huh.

339
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,882
[YUKIMURA]
You got us again, huh?

340
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,517
[KANOU] So we ARE doing it?
(Fireworks exploding)

341
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,251
[AOI]
The fireworks are way too loud,

342
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,254
so we'll save the best
stuff for later, okay?
(Chuckles)

343
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,562
[SAKURA]
Whoa, this is amazing!

344
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,965
[MISAKI]
I'd heard the rumors, but seeing
is really believing...

345
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,702
[SAKURA]
It sure looks like their
school likes festivals!

346
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,938
[SHIZUKO]
Apparently they begin
preparations 6 months in
advance.

347
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,206
(Girls screaming)

348
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,440
[MISAKI, SAKURA] Huh?

349
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,109
What's everyone screaming about?

350
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,612
Could it really be them...?!
(Squealing)

351
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,251
[MISAKI]
Yumemishi. There they
are. Sakura, she's gone!

352
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,688
[SAKURA] Hey, Kuuga, I brought
you some delicious snacks!
[GIRL A] Hey, I saw him first!

353
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,456
[MISAKI]
Sakura!

354
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:38,371
[KUUGA]
What did we say? If you want us
to love you, you have to promise
to be good girls. Alright, then.

355
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,876
[KUUGA]
Any nice kitties that can keep a
promise‐ follow us.

356
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,712
(GIRLS squealing excitedly)

357
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,585
[MISAKI]
Sakura! Shizuko! Aaaahhhh!

358
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:57,791
[MISAKI] You got pulled
to the front of the stage?
So then you're...

359
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,393
[USUI]
They're somewhere in front of
this endless wall of people.

360
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,228
[MISAKI]
Whoa...

361
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,931
[SHIZUKO] This line is to get
spots for their show,
[SAKURA] No! No! No!

362
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,467
[SHIZUKO] and Sakura is refusing
to move even a single step back.

363
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:12,338
[SAKURA]
No! I can't get farther away
than this or my life will be
over! (extended crying)

364
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,108
[SHIZUKO]
(sigh) It looks like we're
trapped here, at least until the
show is over.

365
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,612
I'm sorry, but I don't think
it's possible for us to regroup
at the moment.

366
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,247
[SHIZUKO]
You two have fun on your own for
a bit.

367
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,349
Huh?! But Shizuko!

368
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,986
[SHIZUKO] We'll talk again soon.
(Phone disconnecting)

369
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:29,455
She said "have fun,"
but still...!

370
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,525
[GIRL B]
Hey, hey. Kuuga's been different
recently, hasn't he?

371
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,594
[GIRL C]
The members have a totally
different vibe to them.

372
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,662
[GIRL B]
Like they're trying so hard, in
a good way.

373
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,765
I think there's a
different level of respect
between them and the fans...

374
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,769
[GIRL D]
And I've stopped hearing rumors
of them hanging all over their
fans like they used to.

375
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,072
As a fan who just wants to
hear their music, that makes
me happy.

376
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:51,044
[MISAKI, thinking]
Sounds like that Kuuga guy
really has changed, just like
Sakura said.

377
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:55,516
Whether or not I trust him is a
different story, though...

378
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:59,152
[MISAKI] I'm worried about
Sakura... Worried, but...

379
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,154
(Misaki sighing)

380
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:04,625
[MISAKI]
How we see things and how we
think is totally different...

381
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:08,662
[MISAKI]
But, but still... (groan)

382
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,832
No matter how hard you
think about it, some
things can't be changed.

383
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:14,500
For now, let's just
have some fun.

384
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,939
[MISAKI]
H‐Have fun? Have fun how?!

385
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,365
[MISAKI]
I feel like you're still just
leading me around.

386
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,900
[USUI]
Anyway, let's just have fun.

387
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,069
[MISAKI]
No thank you! You always say
things like that!

388
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,672
[USUI]
C'mon, let's at least enjoy
Yumesaki's festival together.

389
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,675
[MISAKI]
Now you're acting like a spoiled
kid? What a pain.

390
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,343
[MISAKI]
Let's go find Shizuko and
Sakura.

391
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,146
[SHIZUKO]
Huh? Isn't Kamumushi's show
starting yet, Sakura?!

392
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:09,349
[SAKURA]
It's YUMEMISHI! I sure
hope Kuuga sings a new song!

393
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:13,086
[USUI] Speaking of, President,
shouldn't we at least mention
that the next episode is the
last one?

394
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,556
[MISAKI]
Oh, you're right. I guess we
should do something
appropriate...

395
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,123
[USUI]
Yeah, that's just like you.

396
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,059
[MISAKI]
Usui, you idiot!
