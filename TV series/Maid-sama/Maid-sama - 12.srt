1
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,100
<swoony>

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,466
Honoka, you look
so cute in that dress.

3
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,300
[HONOKA] Thank you‐
and you too, Subaru.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,866
[MISAKI] My apologies for the
wait. Here you are, Masters.

5
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,066
[MISAKI] If you'll excuse me.

6
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,466
[CUSTOMERS] Okay...

7
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:53,666
[SATSUKI] Oh, hey Misa, can I
borrow that tray for a second?

8
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,100
[MISAKI] Wait, don't‐!

9
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,933
<scared>

10
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,533
[SATSUKI] That's not
one of our trays!

11
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,066
Sorry about that. I made it to
help with resistance training.

12
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,166
[SATSUKI] Wh‐What's that thing
even made of?

13
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,066
I‐It... The floor! It went
through the floor!

14
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,566
[MISAKI] It's just a piece of
scrap metal I found.
The size is perfect, huh?

15
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:12,233
[SATSUKI] What a
terrifying utensil!
[USUI] Miss President, are you
doing that because the sports

16
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,466
[MISAKI] Of course I am.

17
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,300
I will get first place
in all categories

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,833
and collect trophies left and
right!

19
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:20,066
For the sake of the women of
Seika High, I will succeed!

20
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,600
<student chatter>

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,900
[ARAMAKI] And on that note...

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
[ARAMAKI] the 81st Seika High
School

23
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,933
Sports Festival is now underway!

24
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,566
Everyone do your best!

25
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,533


26
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,500
<battle cry>

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,533
<extended cheering>

28
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,033
[YUKIMURA] Pretty worked up,
aren't they?

29
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,566
[KOSUGI] It's to be expected,
Yukimura.

30
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,233
Seika High's sports festival

31
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,000
is a battle between all the
classes

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,533
but there are only enough girls
for one female team.

33
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,433
[KOSUGI] And this year, there's
been a change

34
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,966
to the rules that's raised the
stakes even higher...

35
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:55,566
For the first time, each event
has an award!

36
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,433
These prizes go to the team
whose member gets first place.

37
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:05,400
On top of that, this morning's
main event, the obstacle course,
has a very special prize...

38
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:10,966
[SAKURA] NOOOOO! I DON'T WANNA!

39
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,200
[GOUDA] It's too late for that!

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,966
It was decided in a school‐wide
survey

41
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,133
and the numbers don't lie!

42
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,466
You're the girl
we want a kiss from!

43
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,200
<extended crying>

44
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,900
[SAKURA] No! No way!

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,266
[MISAKI] I'm sorry, this is all
my fault! I meant to get rid of
that reward before the festival,

46
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:26,900
but I completely forgot!

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,866
[MISAKI] But it's too late to
turn back now,

48
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,366
the whole school
knows about it...

49
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:32,633
[GOUDA] A KISS from Sakura
Hanazono's lips!

50
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,400
I, Gouda, will do whatever it
takes to steal it!

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,033
<laughter>

52
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:36,866
<extended crying>

53
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,566
[SAKURA] Misaki...

54
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:43,200
Please... Please
don't make me kiss that weirdo!

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,300
[MISAKI] Don't worry... I
promise, I won't let that
happen!

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,066
Because if anyone comes anywhere
near you, I will...

57
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,566
Eliminate them!

58
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,700
<terror>

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,133
[GOUDA] R‐Retreat!

60
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,066
Don't think I'll be defeated
that easily!

61
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:09,166
[UTSUMI] It looks like things
are even more heated this year,
huh?

62
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,500
[YUKIMURA] Actually, I was
absent last year...

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,500
This'll be the first sports
festival I've gone to.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,766
I'm actually really excited
about it!

65
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,000
[SUDO] Usui!

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,266
Why won't you run for us in the
1,000‐meter dash?

67
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,966
You're our fastest guy!

68
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,900
[SUDO] The prize is 30 extra
large cutlet curries!

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,066
That's three whole months‐worth
of food!
[USUI] I'm not racing.

70
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,933
[GONDA] He said the same
thing last year too, didn't he?

71
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,800
[SUDO] Let's just give up.
Maybe we have a chance of
winning it on our own...

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,000
[HAGIMOTO] And the Seika Sports
Festival has at last kicked off!

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,700
Live coverage will be
brought to you courtesy of me,

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,966
Hagimoto of the Broadcasting
Club.

75
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,300
Which class will be the victor,

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,233
and does the girls' team
stand a chance?

77
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,333
First up, as always, is the
100‐meter dash.

78
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,766
It looks like the competition
is going to be fierce!

79
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,400
Student Council President
Ayuzawa of the girls' team

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,466
already exudes an aura of
incredible determination!
[GIRLS] Go, Misaki! Do your
best!

81
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,666
[HAGIMOTO] The competition is
about to start!

82
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,566
The prize at stake is one
month's worth of your favorite
songs

83
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,066
broadcasted over the
morning announcements!

84
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,433
I'm gonna take first
and blast nothin' but

85
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,100
hardcore death metal
with extreme guitar riffs!

86
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,233
<noticing>

87
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:09,900
<growl>

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,100
<little girl scream>

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,066
[HAGIMOTO] Uh oh,
what's happened to Class 2‐6?

90
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,800
Looks like he's frozen up at the
starting line!

91
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,933
Sure enough, President Ayuzawa
is already taking the lead‐ Huh?

92
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,900
<berserker>

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,966
[KOSUGI] A demon...

94
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:23,700
[ARAMAKI] I'm scared!

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,966
<berserker>

96
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,066
[HAGIMOTO] Goaaaal!

97
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,400
[GIRL] So cool!

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,966
[SAKURA] Misaki, you're so cool!

99
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,500
[GIRL] Ayuzawa is incredible!

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Thanks to her we'll be able to
sit back and relax for once!

101
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,866
[GUY] I figured something like
this would happen...

102
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,666
She's already kicking our butts
and the festival just started...

103
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,866
Not to worry‐ there are still
plenty of prizes remaining.

104
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,033
[HAGIMOTO] First place in the
200‐meter dash goes to the
girls' team!

105
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,766
[GUYS] Not again!

106
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,700
[HAGIMOTO] First place in the
400‐meter dash goes to the
girls' team!

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,100
[MISAKI] Victory!
[HAGIMOTO] First place in the
1,500‐meter dash

108
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,533
[HAGIMOTO]
GOES TO THE GIRLS' TEAM!

109
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,000
<swoon>

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,533
[GUY] You think we're gonna
stand for this?!

111
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,166
She can't just go out every
single time!

112
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,766
[ARAMAKI] Um, but there's
no rule saying

113
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,666
she CAN'T compete
in every event.

114
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,466
[GUY] So what! This isn't fair
to us‐ we suck!

115
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,700
[MISAKI] "Unfair"? Are you
freaking kidding me?

116
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,833
I've been...

117
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,800
fighting with everything
I've got!

118
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
<panting>

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
[SAKURA] Misaki, are you all
right?

120
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,200
[SHIZUKO] Here. It's oxygen.

121
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,366
[HAGIMOTO] Will participants

122
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,933
in the chicken fight
please assemble.

123
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,366
[SHIZUKO] The next event is the
chicken fight.

124
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,900
[SAKURA] Misaki, you should try
and get some rest!

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
[MISAKI] Damn...

126
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,000
I thought I'd be able to compete

127
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,500
in everything by myself.

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,633
[SAKURA] You don't have to do
that, Misaki!

129
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,000
[SHIZUKO] After all, the girls'
team has a handicap.

130
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,666
Even if we don't compete,
we'll still get points.

131
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:39,700
[MISAKI] We may get points, but
we won't get the first‐place
prize, will we?

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,266
I want to get as many of those
prizes as I possibly can.

133
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:47,233
I want the sports festival to be
something the girls can actually
enjoy for once!

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,733
[SAKURA] Misakiii!

135
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,533
Ahh, Sakura!

136
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:58,033
It's time to take... a tiny
break.

137
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,066
[MISAKI] All right.

138
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,033
[HAGIMOTO] Okay, next up
is the 1,000‐meter dash!

139
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:05,000
[MISAKI] I sat out the chicken
fight, so I HAVE to do my best
on this one.

140
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,966
[GUY] She did it! She won again!
[HAGIMOTO] First place
in the 1,000‐meter dash

141
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:09,633
[GUY] Get outta here you demon!
[HAGIMOTO] goes to
the girls team!

142
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,066
[GUY] Gouda... are you sure we
have a shot at getting' first
place?

143
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,400
[GOUDA] Hmph.
If push comes to shove,

144
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,166
I'll do whatever it takes
to win.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,066
[HAGIMOTO] And now, the final
morning event, the obstacle
course, is about to begin.

146
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,500
It's a competition with no
limits for entry!

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,700
Who will be the one to race
across the school grounds,

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,366
clearing obstacles left and
right to claim victory, and take
first place!

149
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,633
[HAGIMOTO] And who will be the
one to win that coveted kiss?!

150
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,100


151
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,100
[MISAKI] I will protect Sakura!

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,633
[GUY] Th‐this is bad...

153
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,933
She's already out for blood

154
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,433
and the competition
hasn't even started yet!

155
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,766
You really wanna go up against
her, Gouda?

156
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,733
[GOUDA] Of course, like I said:
I'll do whatever it takes.

157
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:03,400
[ARAMAKI] Take your positions.
And...

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,966
<battle cry>

159
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,466
[HAGIMOTO] They've all come
flying out at once!

160
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:09,833
First up is...

161
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,266
that old standby, the slope!

162
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, dear! Several contestants
have already been disqualified!

163
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,500
Next up is‐ the tight rope!

164
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,700
Anyone with a fear of heights,
it's curtains for you!

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,333
Several contestants are already
out, and the top contenders
are...

166
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:29,400
Gouda of Class 3‐2
and Miss Ayuzawa of Class 2‐1!

167
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,966
The two of them
have just entered the pool area!

168
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:36,233
Falling into the water at any
point will mean instant
disqualification!

169
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,000
[MISAKI] Dammit! I'm starting to
run out of strength.

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
But... No matter what,
I have to protect Sakura!

171
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,766
<shoving>

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,566
<gasp>

173
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,166
I'm... gonna... fall!

174
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,200
What the?!

175
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,800
[GOUDA] Usui? Why?!

176
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,233
[HAGIMOTO] Oh, my! With this,
Gouda takes a commanding lead!

177
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,933
[MISAKI] Dammit! I have to catch
up to‐

178
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:13,833
[USUI] Although I like it when
you give it your all, I think
it's safe to say...

179
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:17,633
Just leave this to me.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,366
<foley>

181
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,066
[MISAKI] He's so fast!

182
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,000
I have to hurry and catch up to
them!

183
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,766
[HAGIMOTO] And up next is the
volleyball court!

184
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,333
Gouda is all alone
and in first place!

185
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:36,933
[GOUDA] Yes! At this rate,
Sakura Hanazono's lips
are all mine!

186
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:40,600
[USUI] That was a pretty cheap
trick you pulled back there, Mr.
Gouda.

187
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:45,533
[HAGIMOTO] WHOA! What a surprise
this is!

188
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,300
Takumi Usui has tied for the top
spot!

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,566
And President Ayuzawa
is quickly gaining on them!

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,900
On top of that,

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,266
the Volleyball Club has launched
its attack!

192
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:55,400
[HAGIMOTO] The top two
contenders

193
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,766
have entered the
school grounds.

194
00:09:56,866 --> 00:10:00,200
The goal is in sight!

195
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,966
<extended cheering>

196
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,033
[GOUDA] Crap!

197
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,433
Trip, dammit!

198
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,600
[USUI] Too bad. Looks like you
missed.

199
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:16,166
[HAGIMOTO] Goaaaal! First place
goes to Takumi Usui of Class
2‐2!

200
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,233
[MISAKI] Excuse me...
[HAGIMOTO] And in second place
is President Ayuzawa!

201
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,900
And so, as our first place
winner, Takumi Usui will now...

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,933
receive his victory kiss
from Sakura Hanazono!!

203
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,233


204
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,400
[MISAKI] I'm sorry, Sakura.

205
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,766
[SAKURA] It's all right, Misaki.

206
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,233
I know you did your best!

207
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,666
[USUI] What's this? The prize is
to "RECEIVE" a kiss?

208
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,633
Then, I'll pass.

209
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,533
[MISAKI] <foley>

210
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,200
[USUI] I'm not the type that
likes BEING kissed...

211
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:51,066
I'm more about doing the kissing
myself.

212
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,133
[HAGIMOTO] Uh‐ and so, the kiss
goes to our next runner up...
President Ayuzawa!

213
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,266
[SAKURA] Smooch!

214
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,000
[GOUDA] If I'd just kept going I
would've gotten second place...!

215
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,866
[SHIZUKO] That was awfully
lucky.

216
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,666
[SAKURA] Yeah.

217
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:17,900
[ALL] Finished!

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,033
[KUROSAKI] Isn't it perfect?!

219
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,166
[SHIROKAWA] Great work,
Kurotatsu!

220
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,000
[SARASHINA] I think I might cry!

221
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,233
[HAGIMOTO] Now then, we'll be
breaking for lunch

222
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,233
before the
afternoon events!

223
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,600
<giggling chatter>

224
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:46,133
[SUZUNA] Sis, you sure
have been busy, haven't you?

225
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,566
Class got out early today,
so I came to watch you.

226
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,133
[MISAKI] Suzuna!

227
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,733
[SUZUNA] I've learned that
postcard giveaways

228
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,500
aren't the
only way to win prizes.

229
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,666
Next week the neighborhood
committee is also having a
sports festival,

230
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:02,266
and two weeks from now is the
shopping mall's sports festival.

231
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,033
[SUZUNA] Enter those, okay?

232
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,666
[KUROSAKI] I ditch the sports
fest

233
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:09,966
And sew up this dress

234
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,538
Am I not the best?

235
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:14,104
[SHIROKAWA] Kurotatsu, good job!

236
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:15,971
[SARASHINA] You're so talented
that it's creepy!

237
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:19,271
[KUROSAKI] So, when do you think
we should we give Misa her
special present?

238
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,971
[SHIROKAWA] She's gonna love
it...

239
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:25,504
[SARASHINA] Hey, someone's
coming! Hurry up and hide that!
[KUROSAKI] But where?!

240
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:28,238
[SHIROKAWA] Over here‐
stick it in one of these
bags full of clothes!

241
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:31,538
[KUROSAKI] Here‐ put it in there
before someone sees!

242
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:34,571
[HAGIMOTO] And now, we will
begin the afternoon events!

243
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,838


244
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,338
<dread>

245
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:43,171
[MISAKI] I was so hellbent on
not participating in this that I
forgot all about it...

246
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:46,004
[USUI] Hey, President, are you
doing this event, too?

247
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:50,338
[MISAKI] Actually, I think I'm
gonna go ahead and pass on this
one...

248
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,638
[USUI] But why?

249
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,004
Pretty ironic, huh?

250
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:56,038
The costume race almost seems
like it was MADE just for you.

251
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:58,671
[USUI] It's all right. It's
not like wearing a silly costume

252
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,938
is going to give away your
secret part‐time job.

253
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:02,338
Let's cosplay!

254
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:04,338
[MISAKI] You wanna get slapped?

255
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:06,971
[USUI] If you do it, I'll do it,
too.

256
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,438
[MISAKI] Just go by yourself!

257
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,704
[SHIZUKO] Misaki! Please leave
the costume race to me!

258
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,204
[SHIZUKO] Each team must have at
least one member compete in this
as well.

259
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:17,904
[SHIZUKO] But asking you to
enter every single event is far
too unreasonable.

260
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,571
I couldn't do that in good
conscience.

261
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,704
[SAKURA] I'll be doing it, too,
so just rest, okay?

262
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:26,071
[SHIZUKO] Also, this event seems
to be a magnet for others such
as myself,

263
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:28,138
[SHIZUKO] who are not athletic
in the slightest.

264
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,971
Therefore I feel that I MUST
contribute!

265
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:33,338
[SAKURA] Oh! But don't you have
to change clothes in front of
everyone?

266
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,804
[SHIZUKO] Indeed‐ but fear not.

267
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,871
I have prepared this poncho
exactly for that purpose.

268
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:39,471
[SAKURA] Wow, Shizuko, it's like
you've been planning this all
along!

269
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:41,238
[SHIZUKO] With this‐
there's nothing to worry about.

270
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:43,171
[MISAKI] That's not true,
Shizuko!

271
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,338
[MISAKI] I couldn't live with
myself...

272
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,938
[MISAKI] if I sent some
defenseless girl into the midst
of a pack of wolves, butt naked!

273
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,104
Therefore....

274
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,804
I will compete in this event!

275
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:54,204
[HAGIMOTO] Continuing on,

276
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,171
will the participants for the
12th event,

277
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:58,738
the costume race, please
assemble at the starting line.

278
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,738
[MISAKI] It's okay, it's okay!
No one will know I'm a maid.

279
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:05,404
[USUI] President. You're moving
your arms and legs in tandem it
looks weird.

280
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:06,138
<gasp>

281
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:07,438
Are you sure you're okay

282
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,204
with being the only girl
in the entire event?

283
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:10,371
No one else wanted to do it.

284
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:11,904
[MISAKI] I'll be fine, thanks.

285
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:18,571
Okay... go for a costume that
doesn't stand out and head
straight for the goal.

286
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,638
[GUY] Aw man, it's about to
start.

287
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:22,904
Just having to watch this stupid
thing is painful.

288
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:26,238
The participants have absolutely
zero motivation, the costumes
are crap,

289
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,304
and the reward is even crappier.

290
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:32,004
The principal's "lucky, academic
ability‐increasing pencil"?

291
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,304
[GUY] Who the hell would want
that thing?

292
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,604
[YUKIMURA] Oh, Miss President!

293
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,971
Are you competing for the girls'
team again?

294
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:39,304
[MISAKI] Yukimura!

295
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,104
[YUKIMURA] Huh? Mr. Usui, you're
competing too?

296
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:42,638
But isn't this event mainly

297
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,804
for the weaker competitors who
aren't very good at sports?

298
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,838
[USUI] Yeah, I'm just doing it
because the President's in it
too.

299
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:49,471
[MISAKI] Are you not the
athletic type, Yukimura?

300
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,838
[YUKIMURA] Yeah, I'm awful.

301
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:52,204
When it comes to sports all I do

302
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:53,838
is drag the rest
of the team down...

303
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:56,171
[YUKIMURA] But here at Seika,
they have an event

304
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,238
that even people like me can
participate in,

305
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:00,338
and that makes me really happy!

306
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:03,271
I had to miss out on last year's
festival because I had a cold.

307
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:06,104
So this year will be
my first time to participate.

308
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:07,138
[MISAKI] I see...

309
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:09,604
I'm sure you'll do your best!

310
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,938
[YUKIMURA] Right!

311
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:16,638
[USUI] I'm sure you'll do YOUR
best, too, won't you, Miss
Cosplay?

312
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:19,704
[HAGIMOTO] Now then, before we
begin allow me to explain the
rules:

313
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:23,604
A "costume selection zone" has
been prepared 50 meters from the
starting point.

314
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:27,538
Please do not take a single look
at the contents when selecting
your bag.

315
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:31,738
Another 50 meters away
is the changing room.

316
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,671
If you can put your costume on
in the dark

317
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,138
and run one lap around the
track, you win!

318
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:37,571
The most important point in this
event

319
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,871
is choosing a costume
that is easy to change into!

320
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:43,504
Now then, all participants,
please assemble at
the starting line!

321
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,638
[GONDA] H‐hey, wait a second,
isn't that...?

322
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,938
Isn't that Usui?!

323
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,804
[SUDO] Why is he competing in
this event

324
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:51,071
out of all the other ones?!

325
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,904
Well, guess we better
get this over with.

326
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:55,104
Sure is a pain in the ass
though.

327
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,738
[ARAMAKI] Okay‐ on your mark...!

328
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:02,171
<noticing>

329
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,704
<moaning>

330
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:06,171
[MISAKI] They're tired after
only three seconds?!

331
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,138
This is throwing me off!

332
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:08,704
[USUI] Oh, Miss President.

333
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,671
C'mon, hurry up.

334
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,538
Which one will you choose?

335
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,371
[MISAKI] He's enjoying himself
way too much.

336
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,838
Still, there's no way of knowing
what's inside each bag.

337
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:22,871
At any rate, choosing one that's
full of lots of clothes is
probably the safest bet.

338
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,471
Now I have to hurry and change
before the tent is crawling with
guys!

339
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,204
[SHIROKAWA] Where could it have
gone?!

340
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,404
[BOTH] Why? Why? Why?

341
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:34,304
[KUROSAKI] And I put so much
hard work into that costume,
too!

342
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:39,271
[MISAKI] It's so dark! How the
heck am I even supposed to know
what I'm putting on?

343
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,238
Still, this feels really
familiar somehow...

344
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,504
[USUI] President, what costume
did you get?

345
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:51,504
[MISAKI] An illusion! That was
some kind of optical illusion
just now!

346
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,604
Yeah, just keep telling yourself
that, President.

347
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,804
But it's definitely a maid
outfit.

348
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:02,638
[MISAKI] What the hell! Of all
things, why this?!

349
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:05,538
[USUI] You went for the bag with
the most clothes, didn't you?

350
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:09,071
Anyway, what's the problem? If
you think about it, it's the
perfect match.

351
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,771
After all, you're a girl.

352
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,071
[MISAKI] Yeah, but that's beside
the point...!

353
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:15,271
[USUI] Just take a look at those
other guys.

354
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,171
[MISAKI] That's rough!

355
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,938
[USUI] Right?

356
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,204
Now then... will you change
yourself?

357
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,138
Or do I have to do it
by force?

358
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:27,771
Where do you get off making
a nasty perverted statement
like that, you FREAK?!

359
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:28,671
[USUI] Uh‐oh.

360
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:29,838
Yelp!

361
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:31,938
[MISAKI] What was that dog‐like
noise just now?

362
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:33,171
[YUKIMURA] <foley>

363
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:34,471
[MISAKI] Yukimura!

364
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,904
[YUKIMURA] That voice is...
Miss President?!

365
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,904
I'm sorry‐ did I
do something wrong?

366
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,504
[MISAKI] Uh no it was an
accident...

367
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,071
[YUKIMURA] I'll leave right now!

368
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,504
[MISAKI] Wait, Yukimura!

369
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,838
[USUI] He's so focused that
he's not even listening.

370
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:50,171
Still, I think you should be
worrying about yourself instead
of Yukimura.

371
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:51,938
I almost forgot...

372
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,171
What am I going to do with this?

373
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,238
My outfit's transformed?!

374
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:00,871
[USUI] That's not it,
President...

375
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,371
[KOSUGI] Who's that in the maid
costume?

376
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,138
[ARAMAKI] Is that Yukimura?!

377
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:17,538
Is it just me or does he
actually pull that off pretty
well for a guy?

378
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,338
I bet he packed that costume
himself because he wanted to
stand out!

379
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:23,771
[YUKIMURA] Huh? What're you
saying?

380
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,871
Look at him! He's tryin' to show
off for us, boys!

381
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,271
Oh, is that it?

382
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,804
[YUKIMURA] No! You're wrong!

383
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:31,704
[STUDENT] He thought he would
add some spice to the event

384
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:32,604
by dressing up all special!

385
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:33,838
How KIND of him.

386
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,138
<laughing> Looks like it worked!

387
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,238
I can't believe those guys!
I'll show them‐!

388
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:40,971
[USUI] No. You have to change
into a costume before you exit
the tent.

389
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,171
Otherwise, you'll be
disqualified.

390
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,904
[MISAKI] Gaaa! So?! This isn't
the time for that!

391
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:47,504
[USUI] It can't be helped, can
it?

392
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:50,338
This is Yukimura's first time
participating,

393
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:52,371
and with his personality being
the way it is,

394
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,704
he's giving it
his all, but...

395
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:55,238
The truth is that
out of all of the people

396
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:56,304
participating in the
event,

397
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:58,838
no one gives a damn about it.

398
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:02,638
It's one thing for them to not
be athletic, or good at sports,

399
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:06,871
but no one will care about an
event where the participants
don't even try.

400
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,004
And even if someone
does make an effort to succeed,

401
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,638
in the end, it's going to be
futile.

402
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:12,604
<mockings>

403
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:17,038
[MISAKI] So what you're telling
me is all we can do is sit back

404
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:20,871
while they point their fingers
and laugh at him for trying?!

405
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,038
[MISAKI] I can't...

406
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,671
I won't allow it!

407
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,338
Doin' all right there, Miss
Maid?

408
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:38,404
For somethin' you made yourself,
that skirt sure does seem awful
long, doesn't it?

409
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:41,938
Aww, we didn't hurt his
feelings, did we?

410
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,771
Man that's hilarious!

411
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:44,838
Huh?

412
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:48,704
[MISAKI] Are you all right?

413
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:52,171
Pick yourself up, Yukimura.

414
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,471
Let's finish this together.

415
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:01,938
Who the hell is that guy?

416
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,771
Hey look, there's someone else!

417
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,604
Usui?!

418
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,738
All of a sudden, those guys took
their costumes to another level!

419
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,304
[USUI] Wait, Miss President.

420
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,238
Did he say "President"?!
What are those two

421
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,171
doing something
like the costume race for?

422
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:17,138
And they're actually taking it
seriously?!

423
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,438
[MISAKI] So what if we are?

424
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:21,671
You got a problem with that?

425
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:22,804
Uh...

426
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:24,538
No, no problem at all.

427
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:27,704
For a second I'd started to
convince myself that it was
really cool!

428
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,504
Well, what do you say we race to
the goal,

429
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,304
and cross the finish line while
holding each other's hands‐

430
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,971
[MISAKI] Just shut up and run
so we can get this over with.

431
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:36,404
[USUI] You know, Miss President,
that costume actually
turned out pretty good on you.

432
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:39,004
[MISAKI] I said shut up! Just
keep it moving!

433
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,971
[YUKIMURA] U‐uh, guys?

434
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:43,638
Thank you very much, Miss
President!

435
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,971
[SAKURA] Wow, Misaki! You look
super cool!

436
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:54,038
[SHIZUKO] I had no idea there
were even costumes like this.

437
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:57,071
[MISAKI] Uh, actually, we just
threw a bunch of different
things together

438
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:58,504
and ended up with these.

439
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:00,538
[ARAMAKI] Miss President,
that's a disqualification.

440
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,604
[MISAKI] Uh, sorry about that...

441
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:05,904
Still, I thought they ended up
looking pretty good.

442
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,704
[USUI] Truly impressive, Miss
President.

443
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:22,671
In a single day, you've managed
to cover your entire body in
wounds.

444
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:24,504
[MISAKI] Say... don't you think
there's a way

445
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:26,771
to make the costume race better
somehow?

446
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,771
I think we could get the
participants to take things more
seriously

447
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,471
with some improvements.

448
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:33,638
Maybe if the costumes
were something cooler‐

449
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:35,504
like super heroes or video game
characters,

450
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:38,438
people would actually want to
participate...

451
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:39,838
Maybe I should bring this up

452
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,738
with the student council...

453
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,471
[USUI] Sure. Why not?

454
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,904
[MISAKI] Oh, really?

455
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:49,838
[USUI] President...

456
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:51,704
Good work today.

457
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:59,504
[MISAKI] Don't ever do that
again, you pervert!

458
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,571
<extended wail>
[SHIROKAWA] HUHHH?! WHYYYY?!

459
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,571
[KUROSAKI] I spent a whole week
slaving away,

460
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,538
making it just for Misa. All for
nothing...

461
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:51,571
[MISAKI] Today really wore me
out.

462
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:54,438
Yo, Usui, you look like
you're free. Do this for me.

463
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:57,404
C'mon. Do the next episode talk
thing.

464
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,504
[USUI] Oh, it's written right
here. Like this, huuuh?

465
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,338
[YUKIMURA] Mr. Usui, you're not
putting enough into it!

466
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,604
[USUI] Yukimura, looks like
you've got it rough next
episode.

467
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:04,204
[YUKIMURA] Huh?!

468
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:06,038
[USUI] And the Three Idiots
appear, too.

469
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,071
[SHIROKAWA] Hey, now!

470
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,104
We won't let you call us

471
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,438
the Three Idiots anymore!

472
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:11,871
Like they say,
"To know me is to rub me." Yup!

473
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,904
[KUROSAKI] That's not it,
Shiroyan. "To love me is to
grope me." That's it, right?

474
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,604
[SARASHINA] Huh? The title has
"idiots" written in it.

475
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:19,238
[BOTH] Why?!
