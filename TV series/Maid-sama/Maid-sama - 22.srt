1
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,297
[SHIROKAWA]
Tomorrow is the start of our
class field trip to the woods!

2
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,499
Five days and four
nights in nature!

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,267
We'll be playing tennis and
swimming by day,

4
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,604
and enjoying fresh‐cooked meals
and hot springs by night!

5
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,706
And we can catch unicorn beetles
and sell them for enough cash

6
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,341
to eat the entire Maid Latte
menu for a WHOLE WEEK!

7
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,943
AND I heard from one of the
seniors that

8
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,512
there's gonna be a beautiful
SINGLE babe in a white dress

9
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,813
staying at a nearby guest house!

10
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,715
[TRIO]
Whoaaa!

11
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,951
[SHINTANI]
(chewing) Is this outdoor
field trip thing really that
much fun?

12
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,222
You betcha! All the seniors
keep going on and on about
how great it is‐

13
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,857
[SHINTANI]
(huh) Ah! Misaki!

14
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,225
He ain't listening.

15
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,660
Well, we better get back
to our classroom.

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,695
We are in a different
class, after all...

17
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,297
[MISAKI] Stop eating bread
crusts while you walk!
(SHINTANI laughing)

18
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,741
(BOYS grunting)

19
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,210
[BOYS]
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

20
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,679
[TRIO]
This isn't right at all!

21
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,114
What the heck is this crap?!
Why are we at a temple?!

22
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,583
The field trip is supposed to be
about

23
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,518
"freedom, paradise, and
living life to its fullest!"

24
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,554
That's what all of
the seniors told us!
What the heck is going on?!

25
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,122
More importantly, where's the
hottie with the white dress at?!

26
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,659
We're high up in the mountains
that there's no one else around
for miles!

27
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,761
What were those crappy
seniors talking about?!

28
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,663
[MISAKI]
They were obviously
lying to you.

29
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,165
It's Seika's legendary "Fool
the Second‐Years," apparently.

30
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,368
[SHIROKAWA] "Fool
the Second‐Years"?
[MISAKI] I don't
know when it started,

31
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,203
but previous generations of
students who were disappointed

32
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,073
with this so‐called "field
trip," began telling lies
to the juniors

33
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,009
to make them look forward to it
so they could make themselves
feel better.
[BOYS] (shocked) Ahhh!

34
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,345
[SENIOR]
Huh? You wanna know about the
class field trip? Yeah, it was
SO much fun!

35
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,447
[BOY]
Um, sir, are you feeling okay?

36
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,084
[SENIOR]
It was so much fun
that I lost 20 pounds!

37
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,152
You guys are gonna
have the time of your life!

38
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,989
The food is great, and the
excursions are even better!
(chuckles)

39
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,424
[MISAKI]
Then the ones who got lied to
started lying to others,

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,694
resulting in a domino effect
that's gone on for generations.

41
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,596
[SARASHINA]
No way! That's so cruel!

42
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,397
[KUROSAKI] Our dreams
have been crushed!
[SHIROKAWA] This sucks!

43
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,066
[TRIO]
How are we supposed to
enjoy our field trip now?!

44
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:24,004
[MISAKI]
Quit whining! Make no mistake‐
this still counts as school. You
aren't here to goof off!

45
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,107
[MISAKI] Got it? Then hurry
up and get back to work!
[SHINTANI] Misaki!

46
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,442
[ALL] Huh?

47
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,545
[BOY A]
You're lookin' extra
air‐headed today, Hinata.

48
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,279
[BOY B]
Come to confess your love again?

49
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,582
[SHINTANI]
Let's have fuuuun‐!

50
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,754
[MISAKI]
This isn't free time. Go back to
your area, immediately.

51
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,689
[BOY C]
Aw, c'mon Pres,
don't be so hard on him!

52
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,125
[MISAKI]
It seems like you've forgotten
who you're talking to‐

53
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,960
guess I'll have to
jog your memory!

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,494
(BOYS panicking)

55
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,631
[YUKIMURA]
Mr. Usui, please stop that!

56
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,066
[YUKIMURA]
Ahhh! Miss President!
Please help me!

57
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,635
[MISAKI]
What do you think you're doing?

58
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,469
[USUI]
Nothing‐ just some
friendly cleaning.

59
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,505
[YUKIMURA]
That's a lie! I don't
know what's going on,

60
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,774
but he's been dragging
me all over the place!

61
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,678
[MISAKI]
I can see that. Don't
worry, Yukimura, I'll
deal with this pervert.

62
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,012
(YUKIMURA screaming)

63
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,514
[MISAKI]
I swear, what's with you?

64
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,349
I thought it was weird that I
hadn't seen you all day.

65
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,785
[MISAKI] What have
you been doing?
[BOY E] Hey, let's get out of
here.

66
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,954
[BOY F]
Hinata, come on!

67
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,924
[USUI]
Maybe I was just trying to make
a certain someone jealous.

68
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,326
[MISAKI] Ulp!

69
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,529
[USUI]
Was that bad?

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,331
[MISAKI]
Of course it's bad!

71
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,234
That's no excuse to goof off
and make fun of Yukimura!

72
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,103
[USUI]
Huh? I thought it
was a great reason.

73
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,238
Look, just hurry up
and finish cleaning!

74
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,774
[SHINTANI] Huh?

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:41,548
[MISAKI]
(sigh) What am I going to do...
Why are things always like that
between me and Usui?

76
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,383
[SHIZUKO] Oh. It's Misaki.
[MISAKI] Geh!

77
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,752
[SAKURA] You're already
getting ready, huh?
[MISAKI] Yeah. That's right.

78
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:50,524
[SAKURA]
Geez, between meditation and
lectures and cleaning, I'm all
worn out!

79
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,293
[SHIZUKO]
But the girls are fortunate
to be on dinner‐duty.

80
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,062
[SAKURA] That's for sure, the
boys have to sit under a
waterfall...
[BOYS] (dread) Uh....

81
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,199
[MISAKI]
You girls, if you're free, help
out with making the rice.

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,368
[MISAKI]
Also, the vegetable scraps are
being collected over there.

83
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,705
[GIRLS] Okay!
[GIRL] Do you need
anymore carrots?

84
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,540
[SAKURA]
Misaki, you sure are amazing.

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,942
[SAKURA]
You know how to get everyone
working so efficiently.

86
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,711
You think so? Thanks a lot.

87
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,914
I never would've thought to have
washed the pots and pans ahead
of time.

88
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,582
It's way easier this way.

89
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,518
[SHIZUKO]
None of us would have noticed
how dirty they were

90
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,152
until it was too late.

91
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,287
[MISAKI]
Well, that's because‐

92
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,591
[MISAKI, thinking]
It's because our manager at
Maid Latte is always so picky
about it...

93
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,359
[MISAKI, thinking]
But I can't say that.

94
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,494
[SAKURA] Because what?
[MISAKI] Uh, you know‐

95
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,330
[SAKURA]
BY THE WAY, HOW ARE THINGS WITH
YOU AND HINATA?!

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,700
Huh? Wh‐Where did that come
from? We weren't talking about
that at all!

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,069
[SAKURA]
That's cuz I've been dying to
know! It's killing me!!

98
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,005
[SHIZUKO]
Sakura's sole objective for this
field trip is to corner you

99
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,808
and pry every single detail of
your love life out of you.

100
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,545
You can't have a proper
field trip without talking
about love, right?!

101
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,847
Hinata showing up was
such nice timing, too!

102
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,316
[SHIZUKO] It would appear that
the others are extremely
interested as well.
[GIRLS] Huh? Huh? Huh?!

103
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,218
[MISAKI]
What's with all of you?!

104
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,387
[MISAKI]
Ugh. Guys...It's
not like that...

105
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,456
He's just a childhood
friend... that's all.

106
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,225
[SAKURA] Really? Are you sure
there's nothing going on between
you two?
[GIRLS] Huuuh?

107
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:03,196
[MISAKI]
No! Besides, I don't have
time for things like that!

108
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:08,635
[MISAKI]
(sigh) As Seika's Student
Council President I've got more
important things to worry about.

109
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,573
I can't look after him like
I did when we were kids.

110
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,509
(BOYS shivering)

111
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,077
[SHIROKAWA]
Gah, it's so cold!

112
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,712
[SARASHINA] It hurts!
[KUROSAKI] We're in Hell!

113
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,847
[SHINTANI]
This is awesome! Woohoo!

114
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,049
[BOY B]
Wait, don't tell me he's
actually enjoying this?

115
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,285
[BOY C]
It's like you were
raised in the wild.

116
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,853
[BOY D]
You're like an
elementary‐school kid.

117
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,221
[SHINTANI]
(chomp) Oh, you think so?

118
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,756
[BOY E]
Dude, what are you eating?

119
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,191
[BOY C]
You're just too stupid
to be afraid of things,

120
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,292
aren't you?

121
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,060
(bush rustling)
[SHINTANI] Huh?

122
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,636
[BOY D]
What is it, Hinata?

123
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,437
[BOY E]
Hey, don't mess with Usui!

124
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,540
(BOYS murmuring) (shocked gasps)

125
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,511
[SHINTANI]
You're the coolest guy I've ever
seen!

126
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,779
[SHINTANI] Whoa and you're
super muscular, too!

127
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,649
[SHINTANI] Wow! You're
body's perfect!
[BOY C] Hey, Hinata...
[BOY E] That's too dangerous.

128
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,751
If I were a girl, I'd fall
head over heels for you.

129
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,054
[YUKIMURA]
Ahhhh! N‐N‐N‐No! You can't
say something like THAT!

130
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:05,291
Don't you realize that's Mr.
Usui you're talking to?!

131
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,727
[SHINTANI]
Hm? Did I say somethin' wrong?

132
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,228
[YUKIMURA]
W‐wrong? If you're not careful,

133
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,596
you're going to get ravaged!

134
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,832
[SHINTANI]
What're you talkin' about?
I'm a man!

135
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,968
[YUKIMURA]
That doesn't matter to Mr. Usui‐
trust me I know!

136
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,838
[SHINTANI]
Whoa, what's that
delicious‐looking red fruit?

137
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:22,042
[YUKIMURA]
Huh? Wait a second, Shintani!
I'm not done talking here!

138
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:27,848
[PRIEST] Not only meditation and
cleaning, but eating, bathing
and even going to the restroom
will comprise your training.

139
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:35,288
On principle, all general
conversation is prohibited,
however tonight you may engage
in small talk. Now enjoy.

140
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,257
[STUDENTS]
Thank you for the meal.

141
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,459
[SHIROKAWA] Where's the rest?
[SARASHINA] All we get is
this tiny bowl of curry?

142
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,028
[KUROSAKI]
I thought this was meat,
but it's some kinda
meat‐shaped jelly!

143
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,330
[SHIROKAWA]
Is this what hell looks like?

144
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,933
[SHINTANI] Seconds, please!
[TRIO] Huh?

145
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,269
[SHINTANI] (happy) Wahhh!
[BOY B] Yo, Hinata...

146
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,837
[PRIEST]
There are no seconds, young man.

147
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,706
[SHINTANI]
Huh?! But this ain't enough!

148
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,609
[PRIEST]
Food should be chewed more
slowly and contemplated...

149
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,544
[SHINTANI]
I chewed it but it wasn't
enough!

150
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,515
There's no way someone could
just have one bowl‐ I'm so
hungry I'm gonna die!

151
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,717
[MISAKI, thinking]
What is that idiot doing?

152
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,554
[BOY F] He has to clean
outside as punishment?
At this time of night?
(SHINTANI groaning)

153
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,226
[BOY E]
I couldn't do it, even on a
dare. It's too scary!

154
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,663
[BOY C]
But knowing that Hinata, he'll
be out looking for more food
instead of cleaning.

155
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:20,066
[BOY D]
He'll probably end up eating
the snacks people left as grave
offerings or something, huh?

156
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,437
[BOY F] I could definitely see
that! Who knows what kinda
trouble he'll get into when he's
left on his own?

157
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,841
[MISAKI]
Got that right...
Oh, I swear!

158
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:36,382
[MISAKI]
Seriously, would it be too much
to ask that Shintani just stay
out of trouble for once?!

159
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,819
[MISAKI]
Where did that idiot go?

160
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,658
[SHINTANI]
Hrm, no flashlights in here
either...

161
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:50,263
[SHINTANI]
If I had some light, I could go
looking for food on the
mountain.

162
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,466
[MISAKI]
What do you think you're
doing, busting into the
storehouse like this!?

163
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,968
You trying to be a thief?

164
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,438
[SHINTANI]
Uh? Misaki? Nah... you've got
it all wrong.

165
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,040
I was just lookin' for a
flashlight‐ Ugh!

166
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,643
[MISAKI]
Shut up! We've gotta get out of
here right away!

167
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,545
If the men from the
temple find us here...

168
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,147
[PRIEST]
That's strange. What's this
doing open?

169
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,850
Hey, is somebody in there?

170
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,620
[PRIEST]
I guess someone forgot to close
it. How irresponsible...

171
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,692
[MISAKI]
He locked us in!

172
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,094
[MISAKI]
(struggling) It won't open!

173
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,597
[SHINTANI]
Doesn't look like there's any
other way out of here either.

174
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,533
[MISAKI]
(deflated) Why did I hide like
that?

175
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:31,037
[MISAKI]
If I'd just come forward and
explained the situation, he
might have listened to me...

176
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,543
[SHINTANI]
But... right now...

177
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:41,582
The two of us are trapped in
a locked room all alone at
night... be still my heart!

178
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:45,552
[SHINTANI]
D‐don't worry! I know what to
do‐ I read a story like this in
a manga once!

179
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:49,389
[SHINTANI]
Uh, first we have to secure the
food. Then we gotta find a way
to stay warm!

180
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,258
[MISAKI] Uh, it's not even cold
outside...
[SHINTANI] We don't have cell
phones, so wireless!

181
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,128
[SHINTANI] Yeah that's it‐
we gotta use the wireless!
[MISAKI] "Wireless"?

182
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,832
Ahhh! What should I do?! I‐I
can't lie in your naked embrace
till morning comes!

183
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,201
There's gotta be
some other way!

184
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,737
[MISAKI]
Just what kind of manga
have you been reading?

185
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,673
Misaki, aren't you nervous at
all?! It's just the two of us!

186
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,845
[MISAKI]
What the heck would I be nervous
about? We just have to hurry and
find a way out.

187
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,580
[SHINTANI] I...
[MISAKI] Huh?

188
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,284
[SHINTANI]
But the two of us... are
16‐years‐old, a man and woman.

189
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,386
[MISAKI]
Shin... tani...

190
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:26,627
Hey, Misaki I know that... you
may not've ever really thought
of me that way before but...

191
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:32,065
but from now on I'd like for ya
to look at me as a man. I'm not
that little boy any more.

192
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,266
[MISAKI] Uh?

193
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,040
[SHINTANI] Gah! (muttering)
[MISAKI] What is it?
What's wrong?

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,411
Nothing, it's just... this
kinda thing... is really
embarrassing.

195
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:50,316
[SHINTANI]
Oh no, what do I do?! My face is
all hot! I'm getting all red
aren't I?!

196
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,419
Huh? D‐don't look at me like
that! It's making it worse.

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,323
[MISAKI]
(giggle) First you tell me to
look at you, then not to look.

198
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,827
Do you want me to look at you or
not, Shintani? Just tell me.

199
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,930
[SHINTANI]
"Do I"? Well, I‐I want you to‐!

200
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,300
[USUI]
You want to be looked
at as a man, right?

201
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,703
[SHINTANI] Huh?!
[MISAKI] Usui!

202
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,972
[MISAKI] Uh? AH!

203
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:18,545
[USUI]
Well... If you want to be a
man... I'll show you.

204
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,213
(gasps)

205
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,830
[COACH]
You have already
completed three days here.

206
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,001
[COACH]
Tomorrow, your final day, you
will leave the temple and camp
outdoors.

207
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,804
[COACH B] And we will be taking
attendance.
(BOYS disheartened)

208
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,139
Looks like three days of hard
training have left the boys

209
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,275
so drained that they don't have
the energy to screw around.

210
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,846
[SAKURA]
But Misaki, I heard something
scary from one of the senior
girls...

211
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,517
[SHIZUKO] Rumor has it that on
the fourth day, the girls will
be put in grave danger.
[MISAKI] What?

212
00:11:56,617 --> 00:12:00,854
[SHINTANI]
(battle cry) Prepare yourself,
Takumi Usui! HYAH!

213
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:06,727
[MISAKI]
(sigh) What the hell is up with
you two? You've been fighting
nonstop since last night!

214
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,361
[MISAKI]
Quit fighting like a
bunch of mangy dogs!

215
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,230
[SHINTANI] We're not fighting!
[MISAKI] (angry)

216
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,533
[SHINTANI]
This is a heated conversation
between MEN!

217
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,301
[SHINTANI] Ain't
that right, Takumi?
[USUI] That's right, Sanshita.

218
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,538
[SHINTANI] I'm tellin' ya,
my name's Hinata Shintani!

219
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:21,508
[USUI]
Huh? Isn't that what I said?
Shintani, Sanshita, same thing.

220
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,109
[SHINTANI]
It AIN'T the same thing!

221
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,646
[USUI] Fine how about, Mr. Pain
in the Ass? How about that?

222
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,415
[SHINTANI] That
ain't right, either!
[MISAKI] Sit down, shut up, and
think about what you've done!

223
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,952
[MISAKI]
I swear, those guys
are such a pain.

224
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,454
Couldn't they put that
unnecessary energy to a
better use?

225
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:37,390
[BOY B] There is no such thing
as "unnecessary" energy.
[MISAKI] Hmmm?

226
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,161
[BOY C]
Indeed. It is an excellent thing
to live with all one's strength.

227
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,866
[KUROSAKI]
A sound body and a sound mind
allow one to savor the true
flavor of happiness.

228
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,301
Though this fact tends to
be forgotten, lost to us.

229
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,937
[SARASHINA]
That we only realize this
through extremes points to

230
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,339
our own shortcomings as men
who have lost our path.

231
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,809
[SHIROKAWA]
In any case, we should
be off to bed.

232
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,912
[SHIROKAWA]
And give thanks for all the
blessings we have received on
this truly hallowed day.

233
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:04,317
[MISAKI, thinking]
All the boys... and even the
Three Idiots have achieved total
enlightenment!

234
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,524
[SHINTANI]
At this rate, I'm gonna get
eaten up by mosquitoes and

235
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:14,027
be so swollen tomorrow morning
that I'll look like a totally
different person!

236
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,196
[USUI]
That's really too bad.

237
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,131
[SHINTANI]
How come they're
not bothering you?

238
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,033
They're all over
the place out here!

239
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,503
[USUI]
You should be happy you're
so popular, Sanshita.

240
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,639
[USUI] Even though
they're just mosquitoes.
[SHINTANI] Look, quit
calling me "Sanshita"!

241
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,875
[USUI]
Better keep it down, or the
President'll shout at you again.

242
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,552
[SHINTANI]
Say... Takumi, do you like
Misaki? Or are you...

243
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:44,825
Are you two... Are you two
goin' out? You'd tell me
that wouldn't ya, Usui?

244
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:55,401
If we were going out, I wouldn't
be out here with you, would I?

245
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,909
[MISAKI]
Why did it have to rain so hard
TODAY of all days?

246
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,047
[SAKURA]
This was the one day we could
finally escape from the temple
and go camping! Oh....

247
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,684
[SHIZUKO]
It seems like the boys have
already completely turned into
zombies.

248
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,987
[SHIZUKO]
In that case, we may not have to
worry about what the senior
students told us after all.

249
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:19,726
[MISAKI]
What did they say again? The
girls would be put in "grave
danger" or something like that?

250
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,729
[GIRL A]
Look‐ we're finally here!

251
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,599
[GIRL A] There's a tennis court!
[GIRL B] I wanna get in right
now!

252
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,968
[GIRL C]
And a hot springs bath!

253
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,203
[MISAKI]
We should have a
barbecue here tonight.

254
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,173
[SAKURA] Yay! It's been a while
since we've had meat!
[SHIZUKO] Yaaay!

255
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,842
[GIRL B]
That temple food is so light,
it's like eating nothing, huh?

256
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:39,646
[GIRL C]
After all the walking I could
use some real food for a change!

257
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,048
[BOY B]
Hey you guys what's that?

258
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,150
[BOY C]
Is that paradise I see?

259
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,220
(GIRLS giggling and chattering)

260
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,257
[GIRLS]
Uh? Oh? Huh?

261
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,027
[MISAKI]
What do you think
you're doing? Hey!

262
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,229
Get back in line!
Stay back or else!

263
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,832
[SAKURA]
It's just like all
the seniors told us!

264
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,400
[MISAKI]
What do you mean, Sakura?

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,803
After three days of nonstop
meditation, lecturing,

266
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,773
and cleaning at the temple,
combined with a lack of food
and lack of sleep...

267
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,676
[SAKURA]
The guys are stretched so thin
that on the fourth day,

268
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,113
when they're finally free
from the temple, they snap
and lose all reason!

269
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,281
[SAKURA]
They're going to start attacking
the girls!

270
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,017
[MISAKI] Run for it!
(GIRLS screaming)

271
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,586
[GIRL A]
Any other time they barely
pay attention to us!

272
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,923
[SHIZUKO] But at this moment, it
seems that any girl will do.
[SAKURA] This's the worst!

273
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,025
[COACH A]
Attention girls,
escape to the cottage!

274
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,060
[COACH B]
They're rampaging faster
than last year.

275
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,664
[COACH C]
Get a hold of yourselves!

276
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,767
[GIRL A] I've never seen the
boys like that before!
[GIRL B] That was TERRIBLE!

277
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,937
[SHIZUKO]
I'd heard that in the past,
after three days of doing
nothing but temple work,

278
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,674
the girls are completely
unprepared to deal
with the situation...

279
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,877
[MISAKI]
So does that mean the same
thing happens every year?

280
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,247
[SHIZUKO]
Indeed‐ and every year, the
teachers create a barricade

281
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,483
to separate the boys
from the girls.

282
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,186
[SHIZUKO]
That's the only thing that's
kept the girls safe every year.

283
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,856
[SHIZUKO] We'll be fine so long
as the boys can't get through‐
[GIRL D] This is bad!

284
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,759
[GIRL D]
All the rain has flooded the
lake next to the camp,

285
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:00,894
so the teachers can't
build the barrier!

286
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,364
[SAKURA]
So does that mean...
that... right now the
boys are running loose?

287
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,299
[MISAKI]
What?!

288
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,435
[SHIROKAWA]
I'm so hungry...

289
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,138
[SHINTANI]
Takumi, don't you have
somethin' to eat?

290
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,340
[SHINTANI] Chomp! (chewing)

291
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,176
[SARASHINA]
Tonight's the barbecue, right?

292
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,944
They should've gotten
everything ready by now...

293
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,080
[KUROSAKI]
And it looks like the teachers
still aren't back yet.

294
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,550
[SHIROKAWA]
Okay! How 'bout we head out and
be the first in line for food!

295
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,751
[BOTH]
Yeah!

296
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,322
[KUROSAKI]
You guys coming or not?

297
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,592
[BOY B]
Nah. We're way too restless to
worry

298
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,628
about our empty
stomachs right now.
(BOYS howling)

299
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,998
[BOY C] It's strange. Things
were so peaceful at the
temple...

300
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,334
[BOY F]
Oh, yeah! If we're not doing
anything, the girls must be
free, too!

301
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,069
[GIRLS] Squee!
[BOY E] Girls...

302
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,671
[BOY F]
Free...

303
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,273
[BOY B]
I bet they're soaking wet
after all that rain.

304
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,075
[BOY C]
Oh, yeah? We can't have that.

305
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,977
[BOY B]
Let's go and see 'em right now!

306
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,979
(howling continues)

307
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,582
[MISAKI] Guh!

308
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,218
[GIRL A] I just felt
a terrible chill!
[GIRL B] Me too!

309
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,186
[SAKURA]
Misaki, are you really going?

310
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,623
[MISAKI]
Yeah. If the teachers
are in trouble,

311
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:07,193
it's the student council's
responsibility to help them
however they can.

312
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,795
[SHIZUKO]
But what about the boys?

313
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,832
[MISAKI]
Listen up, everyone! If the boys
make it this far,

314
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:15,268
you must fight them off at
all costs, alright, ladies?!

315
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,470
[GIRLS] (scared gasps)

316
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:28,214
[MISAKI]
So they really came. Hope
they're prepared to meet
their maker!

317
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,116
[SHINTANI]
Huh? That you, Misaki?

318
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,118
[MISAKI]
Gah! What are you doing
here, Shintani?!

319
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,988
[SHINTANI]
Well, everyone kept sayin they
were gonna go see the girls.

320
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,758
[SHINTANI]
And then I thought, I'd sure
like to see you, too!

321
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:41,562
[SHINTANI]
It seemed, like, a lot of fun
so I thought I'd go and tag
along with'em.

322
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:46,066
[SHINTANI]
Sneakin' out under the teachers'
noses, hanging out and playin'
cards with the girls...

323
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,001
[MISAKI] Shintani...
[SHINTANI] Huh?

324
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,971
Do these guys look like they've
come all the way over here for a
game of cards?

325
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,440
[SHINTANI] Huh?
[BOY B] Aren't you the
sharp one, President.

326
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,544
[SHINTANI] Oh?
[BOY C] All right men, charge!

327
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,212
(battle cries)

328
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,848
(fighting commences)

329
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,020
[SHINTANI]
What're you... DOINNN'?!

330
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,891
[SHINTANI]
I won't let anyone rough up
my Misaki, you hear me?!

331
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,526
[SHINTANI]
Get yer hands offa her!

332
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,461
[MISAKI]
Who are you calling "my Misaki"?
Just LOOK you moron!

333
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:19,265
[MISAKI]
These guys aren't in
their right minds!

334
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,569
[MISAKI]
If we let them get past us, it
will only end with the girls in
tears!

335
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,640
[BOY D] Don't worry, President!
[BOY E] We just wanna play
with them! Ah!

336
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,409
[MISAKI] No wait!
[BOYS] (crazed calls)

337
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,344
[USUI]
What's this? A game of tag?

338
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,379
[USUI] Let me play, too.
[MISAKI] Usui!

339
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,585
[USUI]
(snicker) Looks like... I'm
"it." Better start running, or
I'm gonna get you.

340
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,055
[BOY C] H‐Hey!
[BOY D] We're in big
trouble now, aren't we?

341
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,224
[MISAKI]
Usui... Heh

342
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,893
All right! Guess, I'll be "it,"
too!

343
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,294
[SHINTANI]
Hey, me, too! Me, too!

344
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:52,365
[USUI]
All right, then.
Let's get started.

345
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,267
[BOY C]
We can play next time!

346
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,169
[BOY D]
And with friendly rules!

347
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,971
[SHINTANI]
I thought this was supposed to
be tag.

348
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,074
How come they ain't chasing us?
What're they running off for?

349
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:05,111
[MISAKI]
That's okay. After all, we
wanted to chase THEM off,
didn't we?

350
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,713
[USUI]
So the "its" win?

351
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,050
[MISAKI] Oh yeah! We sure do!
[USUI] Heh.

352
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,887
[SHINTANI]
Those guys' attitudes really
changed when you showed up,
Takumi.

353
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,123
[MISAKI]
Well, that's because the other
guys know better than to mess
with Usui.

354
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:21,995
[SHINTANI]
Yeah. I've gotten to know that
all too well during this little
field trip of ours.

355
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,130
[SHINTANI]
Takumi... You're an awesome guy.

356
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,365
[USUI]
In what way?

357
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,033
[SHINTANI]
Whaddya mean "in what way"!

358
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,470
In different ways! Anyway,
I just think you're really
awesome!

359
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,873
[USUI]
Your vocabulary is rather
diminutive isn't it, Sanshita?

360
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,642
[SHINTANI]
Don't call me "Sanshita"!
And don't use hard words!

361
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,378
[USUI] You're kind of an idiot
aren't you Sanshita?
[SHINTANI] Wha?!

362
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,913
(MISAKI laughing)
[USUI] What?

363
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,718
[MISAKI]
(laughing) No, it's nothing,
don't mind me.

364
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,622
[SHIROKAWA]
Everything's been eaten!

365
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:50,223
[KUROSAKI]
Who could've done such a thing?!

366
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,357
[SARASHINA]
Is this a...

367
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,392
[KUROSAKI]
A bread crust!

368
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,694
[SHIROKAWA]
It was HIM!

369
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,563
[TRIO]
NOOOOO!

370
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,934
[MISAKI]
In the end, the boys and the
girls had separate barbecues,

371
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,905
and once the rain died down,
the teachers hurriedly
constructed the barricade.

372
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:09,242
And so the girls were able
to eat in complete safety.

373
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,312
[GIRL A]
Are you okay, Misaki?!

374
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,047
[GIRL B]
We were so worried about you!

375
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,016
[SAKURA]
You took so long!

376
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,318
[SHIZUKO]
I'm glad you're all right!

377
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,921
[GIRL C]
Oh Misaki!

378
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,760
[MISAKI]
What the? You're still here?

379
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,598
[USUI]
Yeah, looks like it. Could
you... come with me for a bit?

380
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:38,505
[USUI]
"These two do nothing but fight.
But they seem to get along well.
Giggle."

381
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,107
[USUI]
That's what you
thought, wasn't it?

382
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,945
What the heck is with you? I
told you not to worry about it.

383
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,849
Yeah, HE tried to dodge the
subject like that, too.

384
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,017
[MISAKI] Uh... da.

385
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,819
[USUI]
Look...

386
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,823
Just tell me one thing,
Ayuzawa... is he special to you?

387
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,827
[MISAKI]
Uh... I‐it's not that
he's "special"...

388
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:05,766
[MISAKI]
He's a childhood friend,
so I've known him longer
than anyone else, but...

389
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,602
[USUI]
Is that why you're always
watching him all the time?

390
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,403
[MISAKI]
Uh? What are you talking about?!

391
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,739
[USUI]
Oh? Isn't that how it's been
since he's shown up?

392
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,208
You've been worrying about
him since the first time he
arrived.

393
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,580
[MISAKI]
Of course I worry about him!
He's an idiot who's always
getting himself into trouble.

394
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,349
And he's difficult
to deal with! But...

395
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,353
[MISAKI]
You're even MORE difficult...
stupid Usui.

396
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,028
[MISAKI]
Hey! (struggling)

397
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,797
Hey, Usui!

398
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,766
[USUI]
I've reached my limit.

399
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:45,271
[USUI]
I wasted all my energy...
worrying about that guy.

400
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,308
[MISAKI]
Uh... (awkward laugh)

401
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,843
[USUI]
Mind telling me what's so funny?

402
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,345
[MISAKI]
It's just, the boys are
barbecuing right now.

403
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,247
If you're hungry,
just hurry up and‐

404
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,518
[USUI]
It's no good. I can't move.

405
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,421
[MISAKI]
Oh. It's stopped raining.

406
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,428
[USUI]
Yeah...

407
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:12,533
[SARASHINA]
Dammit! That bottomless pit
Shintani even ate all the raw
meat!

408
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,502
[SHIROKAWA]
Hey, there's a delicious‐looking
lamb over there...

409
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,538
[KUROSAKI]
And it's a girl too...

410
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,673
[YUKIMURA]
(sleepily) Save me, Mommy...

411
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,898
[KUROSAKI]
The training at the temple is
quite strict, isn't it?

412
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,700
[SHIROKAWA]
Let us be grateful for the food
we receive.

413
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,602
[SARASHINA]
Aah, I'm so grateful
for the sun's embrace!

414
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,104
[MISAKI]
You three idiots are depressing
even in your "enlightened"
state.

415
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,907
[USUI]
Next year, the seniors will lie
to the juniors again, won't
they?

416
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,677
[SATSUKI]
All right! After having
such a horrible experience
at the temple,

417
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,712
how about you eat something
that starts with an "s"?

418
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,482
[MISAKI] Sushi?
[SHINTANI] Steak? Sour pickles?
Salad? Sukiyaki? Suddon
noodles?!

419
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,085
[SATSUKI]
Nope, all wrong. The thing
starting with "s" is "sweets"!

420
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,054
[MISAKI]
I think there's something like
that going on at Maid Latte.

421
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:16,189
[USUI]
A "challenge" event to eat
a full course of them, Misa.

422
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,492
[SHINTANI]
Whoa, somethin' sure
smells sweet, huh?
