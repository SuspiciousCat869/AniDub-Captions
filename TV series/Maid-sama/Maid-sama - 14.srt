1
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:38,865
(laughing merrily)

2
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,267
[MISAKI] Listen to
THIS, Yukimura!
[YUKIMURA] Huh?

3
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:45,806
Just now, I heard some junior
high‐school students talking in
front of our school, and...

4
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,274
[GIRL A]
Seika High School sure
has changed a lot, huh?

5
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:52,312
[GIRL B]
Yeah... It's not so scary
anymore. Like it actually
seems kinda nice.

6
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,948
(MISAKI welling with excitement)

7
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,983
[MISAKI]
And that's what they said!

8
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,420
[YUKIMURA]
Wow! It looks like all of our
hard work is finally starting
to pay off!

9
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:04,691
[MISAKI]
With the way things are going
more and more female students
will enroll, I'm sure of it.

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,428
I'm thankful we had such
great members on the student
council this semester.

11
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,866
Next week we have an open campus
for junior high students who are
about to move into high school.

12
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,538
If we keep up the good work,
Seika's female population is
going to skyrocket!

13
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,381
[YUKIMURA]
Hm... There sure are a lot
of notes from the girls in
the opinion box.

14
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,617
[MISAKI]
And stupid drawings
from the guys.

15
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,654
Even though things are much
better, there's still plenty
left to do.

16
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,990
Okay! First, let's decide
who will address each matter
on the table,

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,327
then proceed in order
of most important to‐ Uh?

18
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,665
President.

19
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,101
Lend me a towel or a hair dryer.
(MISAKI annoyed)

20
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,203
What do you think you're doing?

21
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,438
[YUKIMURA]
UH, um, if you need a towel...

22
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,141
and if you don't mind using
mine, I can give you this one.

23
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,844
(tiptoeing closer)
I was going to use
it for P.E. today...

24
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,914
but I ended up not
using it at all.

25
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,083
What are you,
a girl in love?!

26
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,885
He's acting all nervous
around me. What for?

27
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,788
Because you're an
equal‐opportunity
sexual harasser!

28
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,424
[MISAKI] Open your eyes,
you pervert!
[YUKIMURA] M‐my first kiss...

29
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,260
Well? What happened to you?
You look like a drowned rat.

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,329
About that...

31
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,832
[BOY A]
Damn! It won't turn!

32
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,568
[BOY B]
Geez, and you're always
bragging how strong you are.

33
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,638
[BOY A]
Shut up! This thing is
WAY too friggin' tight!

34
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,674
[BOY C]
How're we gonna
turn on the water?

35
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,543
Usui, over heeere!

36
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,613
[BOY B]
Yeah, Usui'll definitely
be able to do something!

37
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,180
There.

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,682
(BOYS shocked)

39
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,117
That's why.

40
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,318
Are you an idiot?!

41
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,120
You should've said that first!

42
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,254
I'll go take a look right away.

43
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,322
I shall accompany him.

44
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,890
Usui! You go, too!

45
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,125
Well, Yukimura,

46
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,127
thanks for letting me
borrow your towel.

47
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,230
[USUI]
I'll make sure to use it on
every single part of my body.

48
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,898
Like there, and there,
and even under there.

49
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,535
Yukimura, that look on your face
is starting to weird me out.

50
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,503
Could you quit
blushing like that?

51
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,705
All right then, moving
on to the next item.

52
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,942
Let's take a look at the
budget for next week's
open campus‐ What's wrong?

53
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,278
Well it's just I can't
seem to find the treasury
notebook anywhere...

54
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,780
You lost it?

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,616
But I had it right here
just a minute ago, I swear!

56
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,853
Hey, has anyone seen his
notebook lying... around...?

57
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,487
(KOSUGI snoring) (smack)

58
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,156
Dammit, Secretary!

59
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,092
You've got some nerve dozing off
during our meeting like this!

60
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:24,464
O‐oh... Sorry, Pres, but...
I'm just so tired that I
can't help it... (snoring)

61
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,700
[MISAKI]
Pull yourself together!

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,769
[ARAMAKI] Miss President,
calm down! Please!
[KANOU] Hmph.

63
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,471
[MISAKI]
He's not even writing down any
of the meeting minutes! Aaargh!

64
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,007
(morning chatter and laughter)

65
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,110
Good morning.

66
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,014
[TRIO] Good morning to you,
Miss President.
[MISAKI, thinking]
I'm warning people about their

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,950
[MISAKI, thinking] Things are
going great!
[KATATA]
My apologies, Miss President.

68
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,619
Oh, hey there, Katata.

69
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,488
You're always so punctual,
it's weird that you're la‐

70
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,124
What the heck is thaaaaat?!

71
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,826
Is something the
matter, ma'am?

72
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,094
(school bell rings)

73
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,495
[KATATA]
Well, e‐excuse my attire,

74
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,263
I don't know what came over me.

75
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,566
Dude, are you sure
you're feeling okay?

76
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,104
(MISAKI sighs)
[SAWA] President, I'm sorry.

77
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,407
I've looked all over, but
I can't find the treasury
notebook anywhere.

78
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,275
[MISAKI] Here.
[SAWA] AH!

79
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,477
I filled in as much as
I could from memory.

80
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,481
It won't be entirely accurate,
but we can use that until we
find the original.

81
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,918
You filled in the whole
thing just from memory?!

82
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,654
You even recorded the figures
from yesterday's meeting!

83
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,789
That's because thanks
to a certain slacker

84
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,692
our minutes from yesterday
were completely useless.

85
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:30,463
Hey, Hayase. Isn't this
is the list of nurse's
office attendees?

86
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,232
Should this be in the trash?

87
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,734
Huh? It shouldn't be.

88
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,169
How the heck did this
get in there...?

89
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,940
(thinking) Strange. This is
a mistake an organized guy
like him would never make.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,410
Then there was Katata this
morning and Kosugi yesterday...
Just what is going on?

91
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,946
(giggling)
No way!

92
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,347
So then‐

93
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,083
[GIRL A]
Huh? That guys' wearing
a hoodie again.

94
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,820
[GIRL B]
He's even got his hood
up. Isn't he hot?

95
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,056
(GIRLS confused)

96
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,126
[KANOU]
You're on the student
council, aren't you?

97
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,996
Uh? Yeah, can I help you?

98
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,203
(soft guitar music playing
over broadcast system)

99
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,705
Huh? What's that?

100
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,642
[YUKIMURA]
Maybe it's a test broadcast.

101
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,912
Doesn't that music seem
kind of off to you?

102
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,447
[MISAKI]
It's kinda making
me feel sleepy.

103
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,557
(bite)

104
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,929
Hey, just what is
going on in here?
Huh?!

105
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,698
Who are you? Are you
on the committee?

106
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,933
Why's your face covered‐ you
have a cold or something?

107
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,702
Uh, yeah! (fake coughing)

108
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:45,438
[MISAKI] Is this supposed to be
a test broadcast or something?
[KANOU] Um, y‐yeah.

109
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,776
Can't you change the music
to something else? This
song's putting me to sleep.

110
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:55,115
[KANOU] That's the point. It
relaxes you, putting you into
a state of intoxication...
(door closing)

111
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,483
UH? What?

112
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:03,023
[KANOU]
This makes it easy to
influence even smart
individuals like yourself.

113
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,932
[KANOU]
Once your guard is down, you
make a rather willing subject.

114
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,835
Taking the words of
others so seriously...

115
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,337
True, you are the heart
of the student council.

116
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,508
And I will have you make a
disgrace of yourself not only in
front of all of the faculty,

117
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,611
but in front of the
entire school as well.

118
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,615
Seika doesn't need any
more female students.

119
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,963
(waking up groan)

120
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,865
You awake, President?

121
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,968
You were passed out in the
broadcasting room,

122
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,303
so I brought you to
the nurse's office.

123
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,639
What were you doing
sleeping in there?

124
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,810
What'syer problem? (hiccup)

125
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,014
Whazzis? It's jusht you, Usui.
Whatcha doin' in here?

126
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:08,454
I got it. Come t'plant another
smoochie‐smooch on ol' Yukimura,
izzat it? Ya big friggin'
pervert! (laughter)

127
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,490
(chuckles awkwardly)

128
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,926
[MISAKI] Usui, ya idjit!
[USUI] President, did you happen
to drink something strange?

129
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,797
[MISAKI] You friggin' sekshally
harass too friggin' much!
[USUI] No use talking
to her, huh?

130
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,870
It doesn't seem like you've
had any alcohol, Misa.

131
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,507
Okay. Ow...

132
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,409
(happy) Thisis a lot sofer
than I thought it'd be!

133
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,412
I thought it'd more
prickly or somethin'.

134
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,081
(laughing) Thisiss fuuun!

135
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,583
Okay, okay. Stop.

136
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,853
[TEACHER]
There's no "drunken student"
here at all.

137
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,589
[TEACHER]
Are you sure that's
what you saw?

138
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,592
It would appear that
I was mistaken.

139
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,894
My apologies for the bother.

140
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,963
What'cha doin' withat?
(drunken groan)

141
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,166
Once you snap out of
this, you'll never
believe what happened.

142
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,036
I want to make sure I have
plenty of proof to show you.

143
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,939
Okay, President,
it's interview time!

144
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,941
[USUI] You feeling good?
[MISAKI] I'm feelin' good!

145
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,443
[USUI] You having fun?
[MISAKI] I'm havin' fun!

146
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,779
[USUI] You drunk?
[MISAKI] I'm drunk!

147
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,615
President try not to get
too angry with me, okay?

148
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,183
Who're you talkin' to?

149
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,153
To the future you when
you see these pictures.

150
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,222
Now then, how are we...?

151
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,659
Hold on! What are you taking
your clothes off for?

152
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,063
Hmnh... Cuz I'm way
too hot right now!

153
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:28,201
Miss President...
Are you trying to seduce me?

154
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,640
[MISAKI]
U‐argh! What're you doin'?!

155
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,942
[USUI]
Oh, my. Where'd this
rope come from?

156
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,911
[MISAKI]
Usui! (struggling) It's hot!

157
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,547
[Usui]
Nice. You look
like a spring roll.

158
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:41,548
It's hot!

159
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,716
Wasn't that fun, Misa?

160
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,451
(MISAKI groaning)

161
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:52,225
Please I'm begging you...
You have to let me go...
Oh please, my Master.

162
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,130
Didja think I'd say that,
ya pervert bastard?!

163
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,899
Wow.

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,441
I'm so hot...
Take my clothes off Usui.

165
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:13,046
You really need to be
more careful what you
say around me, Ayuzawa.

166
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:18,218
It's hot. Usui...
Hurry up and‐

167
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,753
Not a chance.

168
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,723
You big meanie.

169
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,760
It's time for you
to rest now, okay?

170
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,003
[SAKURA] Shizuko!
[SHIZUKO] Yes?
[SAKURA] Wanna walk
home together?

171
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,639
Very well,
shall we go?

172
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,873
[SAKURA] It sure was hot today!

173
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,307
[SHIZUKO] It was indeed.

174
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,209
[SAKURA]
Hot ramen is good on
a day like this, huh?

175
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,478
[SHIZUKO]
If you say so...
Oh, look. An earthworm.

176
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,081
(SAKURA squealing)

177
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,651
Have you noticed that
something's kinda "off"
about the Pres today?

178
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,554
Yeah, she's been that
way since this morning.

179
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,055
(thinking) It's a dream...

180
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,357
(from phone)
[USUI] You drunk?
[MISAKI] I'm drunk!

181
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,260
[MISAKI, thinking]
More like a nightmare!
I can't believe that happened!

182
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,664
So, President, did you
bump into anyone in the
broadcasting room?

183
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,231
The broadcasting room?

184
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,534
That's where I found
you sleeping, Misa.

185
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,269
Yeah, that's right...

186
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,139
I went to the broadcasting room
and ran into that weird guy.

187
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,642
But is something like that...
really possible?

188
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,746
In that case it looks like you
were probably hypnotized by
someone...

189
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,951
Someone with a grudge against
you, someone who really wanted
you to humiliate yourself.

190
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,120
It can't be!

191
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,656
[YUKIMURA]
Wait! Mr. Usui,
what are you doing?

192
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,026
[USUI]
Don't worry about it.
Okay, there he is.

193
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,898
E‐excuse me, I'm sorry!

194
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,465
Mr. Usui!

195
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,067
Thanks for your
help, Yukimura.

196
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,836
[USUI] Thanks for
dressing like a girl.
(YUKIMURA crying)

197
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,204
That's a man?

198
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,106
So you really hate
girls that much, huh...

199
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,076
Soutarou Kanou...
of Class... 1‐7.

200
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,377
(shocked)

201
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,748
[USUI]
It seems like you have
a very interesting skill.

202
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:01,454
(breath) Do you want to
see? I'll do it extra
special for you.

203
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,492
Look deep into my eyes.

204
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,965
What happened? Is this
your true self, Yukimura?

205
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,800
No!

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,349
[KANOU]
Look deep into my eyes.

207
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:34,721
Usui Takumi... From now on you
will hate Misaki Ayuzawa.

208
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,090
(snapping fingers)

209
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:41,595
Hmph.

210
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,229
Yeah, right.
(KANOU shocked)

211
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,933
Just who exactly do you think
you're dealing with, Kanou?

212
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,348
Is Soutarou Kanou in here?!

213
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,417
Uh?!

214
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,219
Looks like I finally found you.

215
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,855
Miss Ayuzawa just stepped
out a little while ago.

216
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,957
She was looking through
this years' class photos

217
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,094
when she suddenly yelled,
"That's him!" and ran out.

218
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,898
[MISAKI]
I heard a rumor, Kanou...

219
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,666
Apparently, you have
something against girls.

220
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,403
Guess that explains why you
tried to set me up like that.

221
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:27,574
If I wasn't student council
president, we wouldn't have
more girl students.

222
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,676
That's what you thought, right?

223
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,813
Sorry to disappoint you
but all the girls and I
are here to stay!

224
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,381
Whether you like it or not!

225
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,285
Because I believe that is the
path Seika must take to become
a better school.

226
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,088
But if you have an opinion
on this, I'd like to hear it.

227
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,125
I will work to accommodate your
needs to the best of my ability.

228
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,594
Because that's my duty as
student council president.

229
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,195
Very well.

230
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,872
Huh‐ what the? HUH? Why
can't I remember what we
were just talking about?

231
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,308
President, though it's
strange for me to say it,

232
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,979
you'd do well to realize
you're very open to
hypnotic suggestion.

233
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,818
Too bad, Usui. Your beloved
student council president is
going to absolutely hate you.

234
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:17,691
[KANOU]
In the next 24 hours, from
now till 5 PM tomorrow, if
she sleeps even a wink...

235
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:22,128
when the President awakens,
she will hate you more than
anything else in the world.

236
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,298
Looks like the "unbeatable
duo" is done for.

237
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:33,073
[USUI]
Stupid! Stupid! Careless,
clueless and air‐headed Misa
is a big fat stupidhead!

238
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,041
Okay, shut up
already, I get it!

239
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,311
Oh my, Usui! I see
you're using a different
approach today!

240
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,381
No one asked you to work today,
did they? Just get out!

241
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,518
But how can I possibly
stand to be apart from
you at a time like this?

242
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,853
There's no way I'm
letting you sleep tonight.

243
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,290
Quit saying things that'll
give people the wrong idea!
[SATSUKI] Oh! How romantic!

244
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,793
[MISAKI]
See you tomorrow, guys.

245
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,561
What do you think
you're doing, Usui?

246
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,330
You've worked so hard,
Misa. It's finally over.

247
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,666
Just let me change
so I can go home.

248
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:00,767
I'll help you change‐

249
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:01,935
Get out.

250
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,471
[MISAKI]
Usui, how far do you
plan on following me?

251
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,673
[USUI]
All the way.

252
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,908
[MISAKI]
In case you haven't noticed,

253
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,043
you're being even
creepier than usual.

254
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:15,115
That damn Kanou, what
exactly was the point of
hypnotizing me like that?

255
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,251
He wants me to hate you...

256
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:23,089
[MISAKI]
But I ALREADY hate you, so I
just don't get it at all. (sigh)

257
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,994
[USUI]
Heh. It probably didn't look
that way to Kanou.

258
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,999
Whatever. That guy needs
to get his eyes checked.

259
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,205
[MISAKI]
I'll ask you one more
time, Usui: how far do
you plan on following me?

260
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,774
I told you, all the way!

261
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:42,976
One moment please,
I'm calling the police.

262
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,444
Huh? You meanie.

263
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,647
Haven't you had enough?
Go home already!

264
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,882
What happened today was due
to my own carelessness.

265
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:52,519
I'm going to spend the
night reflecting on that.
Now leave me alone!

266
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,558
(smile) True to form...

267
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,932
[MISAKI]
I'm done in the bath
if you wanna go.

268
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,035
Your phone's been ringing
for a while now, Sis‐
hurry up and answer it.

269
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,371
(cell ringing)
That's unusual.
I wonder who it is?

270
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,406
Maybe it's someone calling to
tell us that one of the entries

271
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,776
I submitted in your name
has won something.

272
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,110
(click) Hello‐ who is this?

273
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,946
[USUI]
Hey, it's me. Me, y'know, ME.

274
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,615
(angry)

275
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,052
What'd they say? Did they
tell us we won something good?

276
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,022
Well, I guess I'll review for
tomorrow's classes.

277
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,060
(cell ringing)

278
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,630
[USUI]
It's me.

279
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,565
[MISAKI]
If this is a prank caller,
you've made your point.

280
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,634
Me. How cruel, Misa. You know
who this is, don't you?

281
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,036
How the heck did you
even get this number?

282
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,138
[USUI] Love makes all‐
[MISAKI] I'm hanging up.

283
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,812
(cell ringing)

284
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:55,582
[MISAKI]
(sigh)(click) Do you know how
many times you've called?

285
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,350
[USUI]
Uh, around 20 maybe?

286
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,820
[MISAKI]
This is the 22nd time,
you stalker!

287
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,622
I can't focus on my work!

288
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:04,558
[USUI]
I figured if you did
nothing but study, you'd
start to feel tired.

289
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:08,494
I'm used to pulling all
nighters, so studying without
rest is no problem for me.

290
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,164
And like I said, I already hate
you so you can quit with the‐‐

291
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,033
[USUI]
You love me.

292
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,037
[USUI] Ayuzawa... you love me.
[MISAKI] Uh...

293
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:21,241
(hang up)
What's his problem?!
Is he an idiot?!

294
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,611
You hate me... huh?

295
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:28,114
Who'd fall in love
with someone like that?

296
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,450
Besides, I'm not
doing this for him.

297
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,721
I just don't want to lose to
that manipulative jerk Kanou.

298
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,593
[USUI]
Good morning, Miss President!

299
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:44,164
The news says it'll rain around
noon today. How about we share
an umbrella?

300
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,800
Usui...

301
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,936
Don't just casually read
someone else's newspaper!

302
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,905
But I got bored
waiting for you.

303
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,174
Wait‐ were you out
here all night?!

304
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,809
[SUZUNA]
Sis, breakfast is ready.

305
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,645
Quick, look at today's
comic strip is really funny!

306
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,614
[SUZANA]
Oh, in this one it looks like
he has a long lost brother...

307
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,583
[MISAKI]
Come on, let's go eat breakfast.

308
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,094
[MISAKI]
You haven't eaten, right?

309
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,429
Next time, I really
will call the police.

310
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,499
A pastry...? (amused)

311
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,436
This is past the
expiration date.

312
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,772
[MISAKI]
If you got a problem
with that, don't eat it!

313
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,111
Wow, it's really
coming down huh?

314
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,813
This sucks, my
vision's all blurry.

315
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,848
Guess that's what I get for
staying up all last night.

316
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,718
If you're feeling sleepy
I can give you a supplement
that'll help.

317
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,152
A supplement?

318
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,187
It's blueberry extract,
it works pretty well!

319
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,890
I always make sure to
have a little on hand.

320
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,727
Oh, no! I left it
in the classroom!

321
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,763
So much for keeping them "on
hand". Hurry and go get 'em.
Yes, ma'am!

322
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,398
Yukimura's kind of a
health nut, isn't sh‐ HE?

323
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,934
Yeah. Looks like it.

324
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,436
[USUI]
Well? Are you sure you're
not feeling sleepy?

325
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:59,540
[MISAKI]
Quit bugging me!
I told you I'd be fine.

326
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,943
[YUKIMURA]
Thank goodness! I found it!

327
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,010
[KANOU]
Excuse me...

328
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,478
Yes? What is it?

329
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,051
Huh? What are you
swallowing it whole for,

330
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,485
I thought you were
supposed to chew them?

331
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,254
They're like blueberry
candies aren't they?

332
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,689
Wait‐ really?!

333
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,991
Let me see the package real
quick, Yukimura.

334
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,594
Oh, this is it.

335
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,163
Oh sure. Yukimura, what does
this look like to you?

336
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,265
My blueberry
supplements.

337
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,368
[USUI]
When you went to get
this, there was guy

338
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,571
with a hood and glasses
hanging around, right?

339
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,739
[YUKIMURA]
Huh? Yeah, how did you know?

340
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,974
Don't tell me!

341
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,642
President, do you
think you can guess

342
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,078
what side effects this
pain reliever has?

343
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:42,348
Kanou! I'll get you!

344
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,484
[USUI]
Less than one hour to go.

345
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:47,020
[MISAKI]
Dammit! I'm so
freakin' tired‐ ugh!

346
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,524
You're normally not the type
to take medicine at all, are
you, Miss President?

347
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,893
Of course not!
Medicine is expensive!

348
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:57,430
What a waste of money,
I can get better on my
own! (dead)

349
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,666
[USUI]
Please quit shaking like that.

350
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,469
[MISAKI]
I can't focus in here!

351
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,806
I'm going to get some fresh air.

352
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,417
[MISAKI]
Usui. I've got a favor to ask.

353
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,086
Will you please hit me?

354
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,989
If you hit me, I think the sheer
force of my anger and rage

355
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,258
will blow away all
of this sleepiness.

356
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,829
In return, you have to let me
get a swing in, too.
It'll wake me up.

357
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:32,298
The lack of sleep is really
starting to get to you isn't it,
President?

358
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,368
Besides, there's no
way I'd ever hurt you.

359
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,040
[USUI]
You're always jumping
into things, alone.

360
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,144
Like yesterday. You could've
waited for me instead of
confronting Kanou alone.

361
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:50,584
And just why should I have to
wait for you... oh... if I'm
going to talk to Kanou?

362
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,454
The thing about hypnosis is...

363
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:57,490
if the listener feels even the
slightest bit of doubt,

364
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,760
the hypnotic suggestion
won't be effective.

365
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,930
That's why he can't have
any control over me.
Miss President, I...

366
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,635
You're the one person
I'd never want to hate me.

367
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,840
(laugh) There you go again.
You're always making fun of me.

368
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,711
You really piss me off...
you know that?

369
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,480
But, I'm...

370
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,550
I'm so grateful to you...

371
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,121
I wonder if I'll...
forget about that, too.

372
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:31,424
Gratitude for the
sports festival...

373
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:35,629
for Miyabigaoka, and
for the school festival...

374
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,865
I still haven't repaid you...
for everything...

375
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,935
for all the things
you've done for me...

376
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:48,675
[USUI]
That's fine. Even if you never
repay me, I'll help you whenever
you need.

377
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:55,315
And I will make you fall in love
with me, over and over again.

378
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,317
Just leave it to your "Master."

379
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:01,788
N‐now you're just...
talking stupid... Dummy...

380
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,165
[KANOU]
23 hours, 55 minutes.

381
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:17,504
Just five minutes were left to
go. But it would appear that
I am the victor.

382
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,433
[YUKIMURA]
Uh, where did Miss
President go? Uh, Vice
President Yukimura here!

383
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,837
[KATATA]
Discipline Committee President
Katata here. Please forgive my
behavior earlier.

384
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,072
[SAWA]
And I'm Sawa, who lost
the treasury notebook.

385
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,207
[KOSUGI]
I'm Bunta Kosugi, the guy
who was dozing off.

386
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,443
[ARAMAKI]
I'm Aramaki, president of
the P.E. Committee.

387
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:06,479
[UTSUMI]
I'm Utsumi, who lives in
constant fear of our Student
Council President...

388
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,516
[HAGIMOTO]
I'm Hagimoto, who did the
awesome narration for the
sports festival!

389
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,986
[HAYASE]
I'm Hayase, the mostly silent
president of the School Health
Committee.

390
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:16,557
[YUKIMURA]
Let's all work together to make
this the best open campus ever!

391
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,792
[STUDENT COUNCIL]
Yeah!
