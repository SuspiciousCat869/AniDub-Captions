1
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:39,399
[MISAKI]
Huh? You made a promise with one
of our customers by mistake?

2
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,468
That's right. It was
a total accident.

3
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,672
[ERIKA]
He's always been so supportive
of me, but one day he caught me

4
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,075
when I was super busy and I kind
of agreed without thinking.

5
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,011
[BOY]
What? You really mean it?!

6
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,846
[ERIKA]
Uh, certainly, Master.

7
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,380
[BOY]
Wahooo!

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,050
(ERIKA sighs)
[MISAKI] What exactly
did you agree to?

9
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,486
[ERIKA]
You know that dessert eating
contest event we have this
weekend?

10
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,489
If he wins, I have to go on a
date with him for an entire day.

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,691
[MISAKI]
Huh?!

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,893
On top of that dating customers
outside of work

13
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,929
is against Maid Latte's rules.

14
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,430
I've really done it now!

15
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,498
[ERIKA]
It's my own fault.

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,703
[MISAKI]
Basically, all you have to do is
make sure that customer doesn't
win, right?

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,973
[ERIKA] Huh?
[MISAKI] Don't you worry, I can
eat desserts like nobody's
business.

18
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,241
[ERIKA]
Huh? B‐But...

19
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,476
Just leave it to me!

20
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,318
[MISAKI]
I'll be back later.

21
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,191
[MISAKI]
I don't know if this
disguise is gonna work.

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:43,864
[ERIKA]
Don't worry! With this rock star
disguise no one will be able to
tell who you are!

23
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,331
[MISAKI]
Hey there, Suzuna.

24
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,234
[SUZUNA]
Huh? Huh? Is that...?

25
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,136
[SUZUNA]
The answer is my sister...

26
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,738
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
You win!

27
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,610
[SHIROKAWA]
What the hell are you doing
here, transfer student?

28
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,513
[SHINTANI]
I was in a parfait‐eating
contest at another coffee shop,

29
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,483
and they told me about the event
goin' on here so I thought I'd
come for more free food!

30
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,720
[KUROSAKI]
You dumb ass! Not just anyone
can enter, you've gotta be a
loyal customer, you got me?

31
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,155
[SHIROKAWA & SARASHINA]
Yeah, that's right!

32
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,860
[MISAKI]
I figured the Three Idiots would
show up, but what the hell is
Shintani doing here?!

33
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,601
[ERIKA]
Oh! There he is!

34
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,838
[ERIKA]
He's way too excited!

35
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,473
[ERIKA] Oh. Good morning, Usui.
[USUI] Morning.

36
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,409
[ERIKA]
It seems like there's gonna be a
good turnout.

37
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,612
Take a look‐ the
hallway's packed.

38
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,282
[MISAKI] Argh! (freaking out)
[ERIKA] Ah!

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:42,789
[ERIKA] Wouldja look at that!
There's certainly are all kinds
of people out there today!
(awkward laughter)

40
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,427
[SATSUKI]
Ladies and gentlemen! A sweet
chiffon cake with a hint of
English tea...

41
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,696
[SATSUKI]
A lovely frosted chocolate
cupcake...

42
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,133
[SATSUKI]
And a divinely decadent
chocolate sponge cake!

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,801
[MAIDS]
Apologies for the wait, Masters!

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,002
[GIRL A]
How cute!

45
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,303
[GIRL B]
These look delicious!

46
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,305
[MISAKI]
Usui made these?

47
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,274
Sure, I knew they'd be good,

48
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,378
but I can't believe he'd make
something so cute...

49
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,954
[SATSUKI] Excellent work, Usui!
Your desserts are so cute and
delicious, and everyone loves
them!

50
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,522
[USUI]
I'm glad to hear it.

51
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,724
You really ought to think about
making this into a career!

52
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,392
[USUI]
Oh no, I couldn't possibly!

53
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,827
I'm happy with it as a hobby.
(forced laughs)

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,463
[SEN‐CHAN & MOCCHI]
Give us some of your skill!

55
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,398
[SHINTANI]
(chomp) Yummy!

56
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,636
[MISAKI]
I'll figure something out once
I've taken out Erika's number
one fan.

57
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,138
[SARASHINA]
I WILL win this‐ no matter what!

58
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,941
[SHIROKAWA]
I'm gonna get that "reward" they
promised...

59
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,810
[KUROSAKI]
I‐I can't go on!

60
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,912
[SARASHINA] What?!
[SHIROKAWA] Kurotatsu!

61
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,116
The maids will have to punish
any Master who leaves food on
his plate, kay?

62
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,018
[KUROSAKI]
Punish me?

63
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,487
[KUROSAKI]
I'm sorry. I give up.

64
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,422
[BOTH]
He's going straight for the
punishment?!

65
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,192
[SUBARU]
Oh, really? I'm very sorry, sir,
but...

66
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,460
Please stand still for
just a moment, okay?

67
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,262
[SHIROKAWA]
She's gonna flick
him in the head?

68
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,731
[SUBARU]
Here goes...

69
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,999
[SUBARU]
Flick!

70
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,103
Masters, please be sure to leave
nothing on your plates

71
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,106
or else I'll have to
punish you as well.
[BOTH] Yes, ma'am!

72
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,474
[MISAKI]
I'm starting to get full...

73
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,476
[SHIROKAWA]
Thanks for the food. But I quit.

74
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,778
[SARASHINA]
Me, too.

75
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,847
[SUBARU]
Three contestants remaining!

76
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,248
[USUI]
As I expected.

77
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,317
You're increasing the
size of the desserts now?

78
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,653
Usui, you're a bit of
a sadist, aren't you?

79
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,889
[USUI]
Well, this makes it...
more interesting, right?

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,290
[HONOKA]
Smooch! Smooch!

81
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,026
[SHINTANI]
Ahhh... (chomp)

82
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,528
[SATSUKI]
If we're having cake,

83
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,362
then strawberries and cream is
the only way to go!

84
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,833
I call this one the "Maid's
Devotion Shortcake"!
Please, eat with love!

85
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,968
[MISAKI]
They bring this
monstrosity out now?!

86
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,471
Sure, it tastes good, but all
this cream and sponge cake is
really filling!

87
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,574
[BOY]
(choking)

88
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,010
[MISAKI]
(gasp) That means...!

89
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,950
[MISAKI]
I‐I'm finished!

90
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,255
[SATSUKI] Masters Hinata and
Bisanki... have completely
finished!
(PATRONS cheering)

91
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,923
[SATSUKI]
Congratulations!

92
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,859
[MISAKI]
No regrets...

93
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,295
[SATSUKI]
Now then, our two finalists will
move on to the championship
round!

94
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,030
[SHINTANI]
Huh? I get to eat even more?

95
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,833
[SATSUKI]
Oh my! Looks like this Master
still hasn't had his fill!

96
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,035
[SHINTANI]
I haven't had anywhere near
enough!

97
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,539
[SATSUKI]
Okay, please allow me to explain
the rewards for today's
competition.

98
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,043
[SATSUKI] The first reward is
some home‐made, MAID‐made
cookies!
[MISAKI] Cookies, huh?

99
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,548
[SATSUKI] The second reward is
two coupons for a free "Maids'
Special Lunch!"
[MISAKI] Lunch tickets, huh?

100
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:25,451
[SATSUKI]
And the third is a ticket for a
commemorative photo with your
favorite maid!

101
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,020
[MISAKI]
Oh. We're doing that too?

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,255
[SARASHINA]
Dammit! That's the whole reason
we entered!

103
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,893
By the way, Master, which maid
do you intend to take your
picture with if you win?

104
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,228
[SHINTANI]
Huh? Doesn't matter to me,
anyone is fine.

105
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,798
[SATSUKI]
Well then, please choose the
maid you'd like from this list.

106
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:43,436
[SATSUKI]
If the maid listed is not here
today, you'll receive a ticket
you can use at a later date.

107
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,508
[SHINTANI]
Uh, in that case, I guess I'll
go with...

108
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,643
[SHINTANI] Misa!
[MISAKI] Gahhhhh!

109
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,545
[SHINTANI]
That's the same name
of the girl I like!

110
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,246
[SATSUKI]
My, what a happy coincidence!

111
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,049
[SATSUKI]
Well, Master Hinata, you appear
to be ready to go.

112
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,785
How about you, Master Bisanki,
are you ready? Huh?

113
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,254
[SATSUKI, thinking]
Misa! What is she doing?!

114
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,958
[MISAKI, thinking]
I can't let anyone else from
my school know about my secret!

115
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:11,798
The winner will be whoever
can finish our "extra special
sweets" the fastest.

116
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,335
However, please do not force
yourself too much. Oh?

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,538
[MISAKI]
I accept the challenge!

118
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,373
(sigh) I see. So she's
going to keep going, huh?

119
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,610
[SATSUKI]
Can't we take it a little easy
on her? She looks like she's in
pain...

120
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,478
[USUI]
That wouldn't be
any fun, would it?

121
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,882
[SATSUKI] Oh?
[USUI] The finale will be
something they'll never forget.

122
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,985
[USUI]
I'm going to drive them wild
with the ultimate dessert.

123
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,987
[SATSUKI]
Woot woot!

124
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,321
[SATSUKI]
And...

125
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,390
Congratulations to our winner,
Master Hinata!

126
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,725
(cheering)
[SHINTANI] I did it!

127
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,460
[MISAKI]
I can't believe we had to eat

128
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,362
a WHOLE cake for the finale...!

129
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,830
Misa...

130
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,232
Why'd "Mister Bisanki" go
and push himself so hard?

131
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,535
[SUBARU]
You already accomplished what
you wanted, didn't you?

132
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,170
[ERIKA]
Y‐You found us out?

133
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,438
[HONOKA]
It's a decent disguise, but it's
way too conspicuous.

134
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,640
[ERIKA]
Misa didn't do anything wrong!

135
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,175
It was because of me, it's my
fault!

136
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,443
The manager will be happy to
hear your explanation later.

137
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,045
[ERIKA]
Okay...

138
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,048
I'm so glad to see that you
enjoyed your food so thoroughly!

139
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,718
[SHINTANI]
Well, everything was
delicious! Huh?

140
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,729
[SATSUKI]
Master, would it be all right if
I asked for your opinion on the
sweets that you sampled today?

141
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,998
[SHINTANI]
Huh? Uh, sure.

142
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,240
[MISAKI]
Ugh, dammit. My stomach's
killing me.

143
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,812
[MISAKI]
I've been laying here for 20
minutes and I still can't move.

144
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,714
[MISAKI]
What should I do?

145
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,582
[USUI]
What do you want to do?

146
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,718
[MISAKI]
Uh! Oh... Usui!

147
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,520
[MISAKI]
What are you‐?! (gagging)

148
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,923
Just be a good little girl
and try not to throw up while
talking, okay?

149
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,892
You really were an
idiot today, Misa.

150
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,431
[USUI] If it hurts that much,
just lie down.
[MISAKI] No.

151
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,500
[USUI] How about you rest your
head on my legs?
[MISAKI] No thank you!

152
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,236
[USUI] Really?
[MISAKI] Huh?

153
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,471
[USUI]
If you don't like that,
I can find some other,

154
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,608
more creative way
to punish you, Misa.

155
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,777
[MISAKI]
Wha?!

156
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,049
[USUI]
Hey. This isn't fun at all.

157
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,519
[MISAKI]
Look, I don't have the strength
to keep you entertained right
now.

158
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,555
[MISAKI]
Just leave me alone for a bit.

159
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,256
[USUI] Hmmm...

160
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,663
[USUI]
Hey... Were you trying
to get fat? Uh... oh?

161
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,097
[MISAKI]
HEY! Watch where you're
touching!

162
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,066
[USUI]
Huh? That was your stomach,
right?

163
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,635
[MISAKI] You son of a‐!
[USUI] You sure did eat a lot,
didn't you?

164
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,371
[USUI] Well, now! If you eat
that much, you'll get nice and
round in no time!
[MISAKI] Shut up! Stupid

165
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,074
[MISAKI]
Aghhhhh! I can burn off those
calories with no trouble!

166
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,409
[USUI]
(laughter) That's Misa the
fighting maid for you.

167
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,145
Shut up! You're always saying
weird things just to mess with
me!

168
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,415
[USUI]
I thought this might be my
chance to finally put some
MEAT on you.

169
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,184
[MISAKI]
Shut up, you perverted alien!

170
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,187
[MISAKI]
You don't care about other
people's worries at all! (gasp)

171
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:51,892
You just... You always...

172
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,932
[MISAKI]
Forget it. You see through
everything, don't you?

173
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,267
[MISAKI]
Dammit.

174
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,347
[MISAKI]
Did you just do something?

175
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,416
[USUI]
Nope. You must've imagined it.

176
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,184
[MISAKI]
Oh...

177
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,759
[SAKURA]
Misaki! Wanna go to an
all‐you‐can‐eat dessert buffet?!

178
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,294
[SHIZUKO] All‐you‐can‐eat?
[MISAKI] Desserts?

179
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,197
[MISAKI]
Sorry, I don't think I'll be
wanting anything sweet for a
while.

180
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,968
[SAKURA] Huh? Don't tell
me you're on a diet!
[SHIZUKO] This buffet could get
quite dangerous, Sakura.

181
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,870
[SAKURA]
Well, maybe next time!
(giggling)

182
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,939
[SHIZUKO]
We shall invite you again and
again.

183
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,041
[USUI]
The others there thought it was
strange, too.

184
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,710
[USUI]
Why would you want to win so
badly? What's in it for you?

185
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,312
[MISAKI]
Huh? Don't tell me EVERYBODY
knew!

186
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,049
[USUI]
Thinking you could seriously
fool anyone is just like you...

187
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,585
[SHINTANI] Misaki!
[MISAKI] Gah! Shintani!

188
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,387
[SHINTANI] Come with me.
[MISAKI] What's with you all
of a sudden? Shintani...

189
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,390
[SHINTANI] Just come on.
[MISAKI, thinking] Don't
tell me HE knew, too?!

190
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,893
[SHINTANI] Do you
play the guitar?
[MISAKI, thinking]
Here it comes!

191
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,930
[SHINTANI] Do you like to wear
all‐black clothing, like some
kind of crow?
[MISAKI] No, no, no!

192
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,834
[SHINTANI]
Is see. Then that must've been
someone else, huh?

193
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,170
Oh, Misa! Do you know
anything 'bout maid cafes?

194
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,072
[MISAKI]
No, I don't! Never heard of'em
before!

195
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,874
[SHINTANI]
Oh, yeah? I went to one for the
first time

196
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,876
the other day and
was so surprised!

197
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,812
But I thought it was the kinda
place that a girl'd enjoy even
more!
[MISAKI] Huh?

198
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,047
[SHINTANI]
I got two tickets to eat there
for free,

199
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,917
so how 'bout we go, my treat?!
The food there is great!

200
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,787
Whaddya say‐ Let's go
to Maid Latte together!

201
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,789
[MISAKI]
Huh?!

202
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,405
[DAUGHTER]
Let's go here!

203
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,711
[MISAKI, thinking]
This is the only way
to settle this!

204
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:54,715
[SATSUKI]
All right, let's go over the
plan one more time.

205
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:58,051
[SATSUKI] First, Misa and Hinata
come to the shop.
[SHINTANI] La, la! La, la!

206
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,687
[SATSUKI] Misa, you get
up and pretend to leave.

207
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:04,825
Then, you hurry and change
into your maid outfit,
disguising yourself so he
doesn't recognize you.

208
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,594
[SATSUKI] You take the picture,
and mission accomplished, 'kay!
[ERIKA] I'll take your picture!

209
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:11,798
[SATSUKI]
I've got the perfect disguise
for you, so I'll make sure to
have it ready by then.

210
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,199
[MISAKI]
Thank you very much.

211
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,336
And... I'm sorry...
about all this.

212
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,840
[SATSUKI]
Oh? Misa, I know that,
in your own way,

213
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,509
you always keep Maid Latte's
best interests at heart.

214
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,412
But there's a reason you have to
do this, right?
[MISAKI] Yeah.

215
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:32,018
[SATSUKI]
Then it can't be helped.
After all, you're one of
our best workers!

216
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,855
[SATSUKI]
Come on now,
don't make that face.

217
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,157
Hurry up and get to work.
[MISAKI] Yes, ma'am.

218
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,360
As always, our manager is so
disgustingly sweet that it gives
me heartburn.

219
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,863
[ALL] Uh...
[HONOKA] See you all tomorrow.

220
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:47,167
[ERIKA]
There she is‐ Dark Honoka
appears!

221
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,871
Why are you taggin' along,
Takumi? This was supposed to be
a date with just me an' Misa!

222
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,173
And just so we're clear,
I ain't payin' for ya, got it?!

223
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,809
[USUI]
That's just like you, Sanshita.
Such a cheapskate.

224
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,479
[MISAKI, thinking]
That Usui... He invited himself,
saying he wanted to help.

225
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,983
[MISAKI, thinking]
I don't know why he'd want to
come‐ it's not like anything
exciting's going to happen...

226
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,854
[ERIKA]
Very well, please enjoy, Master.
If you need anything from me,
please do not hesitate to ask.

227
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,891
[ERIKA] Smackdown!
[MISAKI, thinking]
Thank you, Erika!

228
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,694
[HONOKA] Sorry to keep you
waiting, Young Lady.
[MISAKI, thinking] I'm glad we
did this today.

229
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,062
[DAUGHTER] Wow, there's my
omelette!
[MISAKI] We don't get many of
our regular customers on days of

230
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,533
[DAUGHTER] It looks
delicious. Yay!
[MISAKI] so only Usui knows I
work as a maid here.

231
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,968
[MISAKI, thinking]
As long as he just keeps his
mouth shut, everything should go
fine.

232
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,870
[SHINTANI]
Whoa, today they have a kid's
lunch?!

233
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,640
[SHINTANI]
I wonder if they'll let me trade
my free coupon for this instead!

234
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,375
[USUI] Not gonna happen.
[SHINTANI] I'm not askin'
you, Takumi!

235
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,079
[SHINTANI] And what are you even
doin' here hangin' around with
Misaki, as if it were natural?!
(Usui murmuring)

236
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,783
[MISAKI] Sma‐Smack! This isn't a
place for carrying on and
fooling around!
[BOYS] Ah!

237
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,052
[MISAKI & YOUNG MISAKI]
Please mind your manners!

238
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,456
[MISAKI]
What are you giggling about?

239
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,659
[MISAKI]
And why are you dressed like
that? Where's your school
uniform?

240
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,796
[SHINTANI]
Oh, this is for my part‐time
job. I got my uniform all wet.

241
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,765
[MISAKI]
You have a part‐time job?!

242
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,867
[SHINTANI]
(laughing) I figured you'd be
surprised most of all!

243
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,937
[SHINTANI]
Even Ol' Shintani can work at a
gas station. You bet'cha!

244
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,273
[USUI]
Using gasoline to pay the bills?
I doubt you'll get much MILEAGE
out of that.

245
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,308
[SHINTANI]
What're you sayin'? I got no
idea what you're talkin' about.

246
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,244
[USUI]
Ah, my bad. I forgot you weren't
very smart.

247
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,648
Hey look you, I'm a dependable
guy who can hold down a job!

248
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:10,817
[SHINTANI] That's right! You
should come by and see me some
time, Misaki.
[MISAKI] Uh...

249
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:17,891
I'd like you to see how
I'm different from when
we were kids, what I look
like hard at work.

250
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:22,763
[MISAKI]
I can already see how much
you've changed without having to
visit you at work.

251
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,430
[SHINTANI]
Oh. That's too bad.

252
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,835
Back then you were always so
lazy... staring off into space,

253
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:33,473
never studying, never
exercising, and the only
thing you were good at was
pigging out.

254
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,009
(SHINTANI chuckles)
[MISAKI] And you were
a huge liar.

255
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,178
[YOUNG MISAKI]
Hey Yoh, are you eating candy
again?

256
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,514
[YOUNG SHINTANI] No, I'm not.
[YOUNG MISAKI] It's bad to
tell lies!

257
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,784
[YOUNG SHINTANI] I'm not lying.
[YOUNG MISAKI] You said you
wouldn't eat any more today!

258
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,285
[YOUNG SHINTANI] No, I didn't.
[USUI] Pathetic.

259
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,053
[SHINTANI]
Shut up, that was a long time
ago!

260
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,722
[SHINTANI] I'd never lie‐
[MISAKI] Yes, you've changed.

261
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:52,392
[MISAKI]
And you're a lot more passionate
than I thought... Yoh.

262
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,331
[MISAKI]
Maybe Yoh isn't the only one
who's changed...

263
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,500
[SHINTANI] It was thanks to you,
Misaki!
[MISAKI] Uh?

264
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:04,705
It's because you were always
such a hard little worker who
always did her best!

265
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:07,708
[SHINTANI]
And you were so kind. I thought
you were the best.

266
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,442
[USUI]
Wow. That's very sparkly.

267
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,245
[MISAKI]
Cut it out, Shintani! You're
romanticizing things too much!

268
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,281
[MISAKI]
Some people called me obnoxious
and said they hated me!

269
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,918
That's cuz they were just tryin'
to hide how embarrassed they
were.

270
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,254
[SHINTANI]
Cuz when you smile, you're
really cute!

271
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,024
[MISAKI]
(embarrassed) Wh‐What are
you talking about?

272
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,827
[SHINTANI]
It's true. Mah said the same
thing, too.

273
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,095
[MISAKI]
"Mah"? Oh, I remember him...

274
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,833
[SHINTANI]
He and Shige came over to my
place one time just so they
could see you.

275
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,102
[MISAKI]
Huh? Why'd they come
so far just to‐

276
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,605
[USUI]
Oh. I'm sorry.

277
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,441
[USUI]
Please excuse me.

278
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,745
[MISAKI, thinking]
What's with this strange
tension?

279
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,212
[SHINTANI] Misaki?
[MISAKI] Huh?

280
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,514
[MISAKI]
Uh, yeah, anyway,

281
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,182
good luck with your
job and do your best!

282
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,951
Mhm. Thanks! By the way,

283
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,919
I heard you've got a
part‐time job, too.

284
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,721
[MISAKI] Huh?
[SHINTANI] What kinda job is it?

285
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,323
[MISAKI, thinking]
What a complete mishandling of
the conversation!

286
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,126
[SHINTANI]
Do you mean, like at a
convenience store or a
restaurant?

287
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,162
[MISAKI] I‐It's just... just a
regular job!

288
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,864
[MISAKI]
Yeah, uh, it's in the dining
industry.

289
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,200
Then you're a waitress! I'd like
to see that! I bet you're great!

290
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,703
[MISAKI]
It's no big deal, nothing
to see, really!

291
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,739
Huh, why not? Takumi, you'd
like to see it too, right?

292
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,976
[SHINTANI]
Or, wait, have you maybe
seen it already?

293
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:22,549
[MISAKI, thinking]
Oh crap! If Usui says he has,
their rivalry will make Shintani
even more curious!

294
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,320
[MISAKI]
Please...

295
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,189
[MISAKI]
Lie!

296
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,658
[SHINTANI] Huh?
(MISAKI gasps)

297
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,065
Hey Misaki. Is something the
matter?

298
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,335
[MISAKI]
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

299
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,439
[SHINTANI]
I wonder if she's okay.

300
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,544
[USUI]
This is someone she doesn't want
to lie to, at all... really...

301
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,913
[SHINTANI]
You say somethin'
over there, Takumi?

302
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,981
[USUI] Snoooore.
(SHINTANI grunts)

303
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,184
[SHINTANI]
I was in an accident way back.

304
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,689
[SHINTANI]
Both my mom and my dad died,

305
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,126
[SHINTANI]
and for a while, I didn't know
what was goin' on.

306
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:12,666
My relatives got together and
everyone was cryin'... but it's
like it was all happenin' far
away.

307
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,736
[SHINTANI]
I kinda... muddled my way
through every day...

308
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,673
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
So, my grandpa is like, "Come
live with me,"

309
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:25,278
but there's no convenience
stores or supermarkets nearby,
so I don't wanna go.

310
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:32,786
He says if we live together I
won't be lonely anymore, but I'm
not lonely at all, not one bit.

311
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:38,191
'Sides if I'm alone I can eat
all the candy I want. Maybe
he'll just go away soon.

312
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,661
[GRANDPA]
You're talkin' that stupid stuff
again, Hinata?!

313
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:43,697
[GRANDPA] You weren't at home,
so I've been lookin' for ya!
[YOUNG SHINTANI] Grandpa!

314
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,699
[GRANDPA]
It's time you stop
tryin' to act tough.

315
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,401
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
I'm not tryin' to act
tough you liar!

316
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:55,075
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
I'm not lonely or sad by myself,
so just hurry up and go back to
Grandma and leave me alone‐

317
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,878
(YOUNG SHINTANI crying)

318
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:02,683
[YOUNG MISAKI]
If you're sad or you're lonely,
you absolutely can't lie about
it, okay Yoh?!

319
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,420
[YOUNG SHINTANI]
(big wailing) Mom! Daddy!

320
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:17,764
Once I started crying, I felt
everything I'd been holding
inside burst like a dam and the
tears just wouldn't stop.

321
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:21,201
[SHINTANI]
When he saw that, my Gramps
started crying, too.

322
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:25,672
[SHINTANI]
Misaki probably doesn't
remember, but I still remember
it like it was yesterday.

323
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,075
(YOUNG SHINTANI crying)
[YOUNG MISAKI] I'm sorry I
smacked your cheeks, Yoh.

324
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:33,747
[SHINTANI]
Her words... The smile she gave
me when I stopped crying...

325
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,451
Ever since then, she's
been the girl I've loved.

326
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,255
[USUI]
Is that your declaration
of war, Yoh?

327
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,124
[SHINTANI] Mm...

328
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,496
[SHINTANI]
If you feel the same as I do...
you bet it is.

329
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,069
[MISAKI, thinking]
"Please, just tell a lie"?

330
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,707
For me to think something like
that, just to protect myself...

331
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:09,149
Becoming the "tyrant president"
and working at Maid Latte...
those are both decisions that
I made.

332
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:16,757
[SATSUKI]
Oh, Misa! That was fast.
Weren't you going to escape
during lunch?

333
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,424
[MISAKI]
Ma'am!

334
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,360
[MISAKI, thinking]
Is this really something
I have to hide...?

335
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,197
Misa, lookie, lookie! See, I
told you it was the perfect
disguise, didn't I?

336
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,735
[SATSUKI]
See? If you put this on, no one
will ever know it's you!

337
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,271
[MISAKI] Manager! I've...!
(BABY crying)

338
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,507
[SATSUKI]
Oh, my. A baby started crying.

339
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:37,210
I wonder if we have anything
to calm it down. Let's see...

340
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,747
[SHINTANI]
Oh, look you're up high!

341
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:45,085
There, there! Your mom will
be back from the toilet soon.
(BABY giggling)

342
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:49,790
[SHINTANI]
Look at you, kiddo! I thought
you were cryin', but now you're
laughin', huh?

343
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,225
[SHINTANI]
(chuckles) That's a nice smile!

344
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,527
[MOTHER]
I'm sorry for the trouble.

345
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,762
[SHINTANI]
Not at all. See ya.

346
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,564
[MOTHER]
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:01,968
[SHINTANI]
Huh? Takumi? (sigh)

348
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,870
[MISAKI]
I've brought your lunch.

349
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,506
Huh?

350
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,041
[MISAKI]
Please have a seat...

351
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,243
Enjoy your meal.

352
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,346
[SHINTANI]
Misaki, is that... you?

353
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,015
[MISAKI]
My name is Misa.

354
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,083
[SHINTANI]
But you're Misaki... right?

355
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,752
[MISAKI]
Shhhh...

356
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,725
[SHINTANI] Misaki,
you're "Misa"?!
[MISAKI] Uhagh!

357
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:28,161
[SHINTANI] So THIS is where you
work?! HERE?!
[MISAKI] M‐Master, could you be
a bit quieter, please?

358
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,297
[SHINTANI]
You should've just said so!
What'd you go an' lie about it
for?!

359
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,500
[USUI] Excuse me.
[MISAKI & SHINTANI] Uh?

360
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:39,906
[USUI]
Pardon me, Master... But please
refrain from laying your hands
on our maids.

361
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,209
[USUI]
Here, as an apology
for my rudeness.

362
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,545
[USUI]
Isn't it delicious?

363
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,813
[SHINTANI] Shrry...
[MISAKI] Uh...

364
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,083
[USUI]
You there. Causing this
disruption shows your
inexperience as a maid.

365
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,185
[MISAKI]
M‐My apologies, sir.

366
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:55,956
[USUI]
Come with me. You will need to
be punished immediately.

367
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,728
[GIRL S]
I didn't know Maid Latte
had these events.

368
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,297
[GIRL B]
Maid cafÃ©s are always so much
fun.

369
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,134
[USUI]
Weren't you... supposed to
disguise yourself?

370
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,704
[MISAKI]
Yeah... but I couldn't...

371
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:14,174
[MISAKI]
I just couldn't lie
to him like that.

372
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,943
[USUI]
Well, that's more like our
student council president.

373
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:21,748
[MISAKI]
Uh? You came through for me
again, didn't you? Thank you.

374
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:25,151
[USUI] Ayuzawa,
you really are...
[MISAKI] Hm?

375
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,654
[USUI]
Cruel, aren't you?

376
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,255
[MISAKI] Usui...
[SHINTANI] Misaki!

377
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,257
[MISAKI]
Shintani! Why are
you back here?

378
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,094
[SHINTANI]
Just now, Usui came out of the
back entrance, didn't he?

379
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,663
[SHINTANI]
Does that mean the two of you
work here together?

380
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,498
[MISAKI]
Usui does, but only sometimes...

381
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,867
[SHINTANI]
Misaki, that outfit really looks
good on you!

382
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:45,105
Dressin' up all pretty like
that... I really mean it!
I mean it!

383
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,007
[USUI]
I won't warn you again.

384
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,544
[USUI]
Touch Ayuzawa again...

385
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,314
And next time, I'll bite.

386
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,982
[USUI] Keep that in mind.
(dog growling)

387
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,952
[SHINTANI] Huh?
(dog growling)

388
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,626
[MISAKI]
What is up with these two?

389
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,096
[HONOKA]
She's so smart, and yet so
stupid at the same time.

390
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,133
Really makes you want to give
her a kick in the ass, huh?
(evil laugh)

391
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,901
[SUBARU]
Did something happen?

392
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,103
[SATSUKI]
Honoka's just busy thinking
happy thoughts

393
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,740
about Misaki. I think...

394
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:53,299
[SATSUKI]
This is rather sudden, but how
about we give everyone at Maid
Latte their own way of speaking?

395
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,801
What shall we add to your
sentences?

396
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,737
[SATSUKI]
Honoka can add "ho" to her
sentences. Ho!

397
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,471
[ERIKA]
Then I'm Erika, so I add "eri"?

398
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:00,140
[SUBARU]
Erika, nice use of the
interrogative, su!

399
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,008
[GON‐CHAN]
I'm going to force this into
conversation, gon!

400
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,777
[SHIZUKO]
We'll get used to it if we keep
using them, sayu!

401
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,478
[SEN‐CHAN]
Don't you think it'll get pretty
tough, sen?

402
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,947
[MOCCHI]
It might be fun, mocchi!

403
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,549
[SATSUKI]
Good job, everyone!
Okay, Misa and Usui,

404
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:09,850
do the preview like that, satsu.

405
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,284
[MISAKI]
Huh? Ma'am, I can't do it, mi!

406
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,586
Usui, I'm counting on you, mi!

407
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,688
[USUI] Next time, Misa's
mom drops some fruit

408
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,991
and we'll see the story of
the Magical Girl MEI‐Dos, usu.
