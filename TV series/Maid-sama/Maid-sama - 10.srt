00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:41,401
[music playing]

2
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,108
<extended screaming>

3
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,777
[SAKURA] Huh?

4
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,452
[SAKURA] I must've just imagined
it..

5
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,087
<extended fangirl freaking out>

6
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,356
[FANGIRL B] Yuuji!

7
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,458
[FANGIRL C] So cool!

8
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,201
[FANGIRL D] Lucky!

9
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,704
<embarassed>

10
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,844
[MISAKI] Next Wednesday?

11
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,180
[SAKURA] Yeah! You're free after
class, right?

12
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,048
We're gonna throw a great big
partyyy!

13
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,585
[SHIZUKO] It's just a get
together with some band members.

14
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,619
[MISAKI] A band?

15
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,153
[SHIZUKO] Yes. They just so
happen to be

16
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,022
students of Yumesaki High
School...

17
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,123
[SAKURA] They're an indie‐label
band,

18
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,491
but they're super duper popular!

19
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,728
[SAKURA] They invited me
to hang out and told me

20
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,162
to bring all my friends!

21
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,831
Apparently, Sakura is
madly in love

22
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,999
with the band's lead singer.

23
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,400
She won't stop
talking about him.

24
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,804
[SAKURA] Shizuko, stop,
you're embarrassing me!

25
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,938
[MISAKI] L‐love?

26
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,773
Yeah, I'm totally crazy
about him!

27
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,475
That's why I really
want you to come

28
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,777
so I can introduce you to him.

29
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,546
[SAKURA] You'll come, won't you
Misaki?

30
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,380
[MISAKI] Uh, yeah but, are you
really sure

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,849
you want me to come, too?

32
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,851
[SAKURA] Of course I'm sure!

33
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,489
[USUI] Huh? President, you're
not going home yet?

34
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,626
[USUI] The student council
meeting's already over, isn't
it?

35
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,393
[MISAKI] Yeah, it ended awhile
ago.

36
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,996
I wanna get a head start on some
of my work before I leave.

37
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,332
I have a day I wanna free up
next week.

38
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,134
[MISAKI] This one goes here...

39
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,869
[USUI] You have plans or
something?

40
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,471
[MISAKI] Sakura said she wants
to get together after class.

41
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,439
[USUI] Just the two of you?

42
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,407
[MISAKI] No‐ Shizuko, too.

43
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,576
Where exactly does this go...?

44
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,177
[USUI] What are you going to do?

45
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,612
[MISAKI] We're gonna meet up
with some guy band.

46
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,180
I don't remember the name of it‐

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,349
[MISAKI] Ah, this goes HERE!
So then this one...?

48
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,217
[USUI] A "guy band"? You mean a
"boyband"?

49
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,353
[MISAKI] Yeah. Huh? Where the
heck does this go?

50
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,688
[USUI] But you don't know them?

51
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,422
[MISAKI] Would you just leave me
alone already!

52
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,360
I can't focus on my filing!
Get outta here and go home!

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,329
[USUI] What, that? Doesn't it go
right here?

54
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,132
<shocked>

55
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,769
[USUI] And, what will you all be
doing?

56
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:33,306
[MISAKI] I don't know! Talking
at a coffee shop or something, I
guess.

57
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,975
[USUI] Is that so...

58
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,143
[MISAKI] What is it? You want to
say something, don't you?

59
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,947
[USUI] No. It's just unusual for
you to do something like that.

60
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,650
[MISAKI] That's true. The last
time I got to hang out after
class

61
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,019
was probably back
when I was in middle school.

62
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,857
[MISAKI] I guess that's why I'm
really looking forward to it!

63
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,825
<excited>

64
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,635
[SAKURA] Here! Look!

65
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,169
[MISAKI] So this is the band?

66
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,672
Make sure to listen to the whole
CD before the party, okay?

67
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,408
[SAKURA] Their songs just give
you that warm, happy feeling!

68
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,943
[MISAKI] Have you listened to
their music, Shizuko?

69
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,377
[SHIZUKO] Yes, unfortunately.

70
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,979
[MISAKI] Did it give you a warm,
happy feeling?

71
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,016
[SHIZUKO] Actually, it had quite
the opposite effect.

72
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,851
[MISAKI] A warm happy feeling,
huh?

73
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,953
[SUZUNA] Recently, there've been
less.

74
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,954
[MISAKI] Less what?

75
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,222
[SUZUNA] Of these postcards.

76
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,824
Now most of them want you
to apply online.

77
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,192
[MISAKI] What's the big prize
for this magazine's giveaway?

78
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,260
[SUZUNA] A year's supply of
crab.

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,762
[MISAKI] Huh? But isn't this

80
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,630
a music magazine?

81
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,997
Well, now that you point it out,

82
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,398
it does seem kinda strange.

83
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,070
[MISAKI] I guess they're pretty
popular...

84
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,342
<humming>

85
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,279
[SATSUKI] Is that Yumemishi I
hear?

86
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,914
[MISAKI] Ma'am, you know them?

87
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,550
[SATSUKI] Of course I do!

88
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,151
Even though they're an
indie‐label band
they're really popular!

89
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,286
Still, I only got
into them recently.

90
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,188
[SATSUKI] Hey, what do you think
about having

91
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,623
a "Rocker Chick Day" at the
shop?

92
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,359
[MISAKI] A Rocker Chick Day,
huh?

93
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,899
<dread>

94
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,035
[MISAKI] I'll have that out
right away. If you'll excuse me.

95
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,639
<awed>

96
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,140
[MISAKI] Come to think of it...

97
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,444
[MISAKI] I haven't seen THEM
recently. [TRIO] Misa, Misa,
Misa!

98
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,246
[MISAKI] Hopefully they're
spending more time

99
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,782
focusing on their schoolwork.

100
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:32,492
<sinister laughing>

101
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,613
[SHIZUKO] I was surprised.
[MISAKI] By what?

102
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:56,049
That you agreed to attend
Sakura's so‐called "party."

103
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,918
[SHIZUKO] That type of music
doesn't strike me

104
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,086
as something you would normally
enjoy.

105
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,122
[MISAKI] What can I say?

106
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,489
Sakura seemed so excited

107
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,492
that I didn't have any choice
but to say "yes."

108
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,763
[SHIZUKO] I just hope everything
goes well...

109
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,197
[MISAKI] Huh?

110
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,600
[SHIZUKO] Ah, never mind it's
nothing.

111
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,469
[SAKURA] Sorry I'm late!

112
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,138
<excited>

113
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,076
<humming>

114
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,215
[SAKURA] It's finally tomorrow,
huh?

115
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,617
<happy>

116
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,423
[KUROSAKI] Oooho! We've saved up
quite a bit.

117
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,526
[SARASHINA] Just a little
more and my dream will
finally become reality!

118
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,562
[SHIROKAWA] You mean OUR dream.

119
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,729
[TRIO] THE dream!

120
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,068
[TRIO] A Single‐Day Splurge
of All Maid Latte Menu Items!

121
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,235
[TRIO] And don't forget!

122
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,470
[SARASHINA] We'll have enough
points

123
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,738
to challenge Misa to another
card game!

124
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,273
[SHIROKAWA] This time we will
not lose!

125
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,175
[KUROSAKI] We'll get our photo
with Misa no matter what!

126
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,910
[SARASHINA] All right, let's put
in another solid day's work!

127
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,479
[KUROSAKI] Shiroyan, don't break
any dishes today!

128
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,648
[SHIROKAWA] And you, don't get
any orders wrong.

129
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,284
[SARASHINA] Oh, we already have
some customers.

130
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,318
[KUROSAKI] Welcome them!

131
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,319
[SHIROKAWA] Hello, welcome to‐

132
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,721
Huh?

133
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,394
Shock!

134
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,096
[SAKURA] Shizuko, how do my
bangs look?

135
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,998
[SHIZUKO] This is the sixth time
you've asked today‐

136
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:18,932
they look the same.

137
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,101
Waagh! But today
is a special day!

138
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,769
They have to look perfect!

139
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,906
[SAKURA] Hey, Misaki, Shizuko's
being mean to me again!

140
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,908
[MISAKI] Don't worry,
I think they look really good.

141
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,575
[SAKURA] Huh?

142
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,576
[MISAKI] Your bangs.

143
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,579
Really?! Misaki, thank you!

144
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,116
[MISAKI] I'm glad I came.

145
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,085
[SHIROKAWA] What a shocker...

146
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,687
[KUROSAKI] It's like the tables
have been turned...

147
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,388
[SARASHINA] I wonder what
they're doing here...

148
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,525
Heh. I'll take their order.

149
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,326
Nah, you can just go ahead and
leave this to me...

150
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,062
No no, I should be the one to
go...

151
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,631
[KUROSAKI] If anyone should go
it should be me!

152
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,898
[SHIROKAWA] No way! You make too
many mistakes!

153
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,235
[KUROSAKI] What'd you say to
me!?

154
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,304
<excited>

155
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,879
[TRIO] Aaagh! They're so bright!

156
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,748
[SAKURA] Hey, Kuuga! Over here!

157
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,116
[KUUGA] Hey.

158
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,151
[MISAKI] This is...

159
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,520
[MISAKI] the guy Sakura likes?

160
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,888
[TRIO] HEY!

161
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,823
[SARASHINA] What is this? What
the hell is this?!

162
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,827
[SHIROKAWA] Are they on some
kinda group date or something?!

163
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,729
[KUUGA] Well, guess we should
introduce ourselves.

164
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,197
[SHOU] I'm Shou, the guitarist.

165
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,666
[KOU] I'm Kou, the bassist.

166
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,868
[KUUGA] Hii! I'm Kuuga, the lead
singer!

167
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:31,071
[YUUJI] I'm the drummer, William
Adam Yuuji. Howdy!

168
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,174
[MISAKI] So... You're not from
around here, are you?

169
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,976
[YUUJI] That's nice, Misa.

170
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,678
[KUUGA] Nice rebound on that
one!

171
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,580
[MISAKI] I've never met people
like this before.

172
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,515
I'm not really sure what to
say....

173
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,649
[KUUGA] Oh, Sakura!

174
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,384
I brought you a special gift‐

175
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,219
it's a limited edition poster.

176
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,021
[SAKURA] No way? Really?!

177
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,394
[SAKURA] AAAAH, they're so
coool!

178
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:58,298
[MISAKI] It's no good.
I can't keep up with Sakura's
level of excitement at all.

179
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,232
[MISAKI] What about Shizuko?

180
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,736
[SHIZUKO] People are like
garbage...

181
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,237
[MISAKI] She's completely
checked‐out!

182
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,606
<faint despair>

183
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,408
[SAKURA] It's really, really not
a dream, right?

184
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,442
[YUUJI] What do you mean?

185
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,511
Right now, having all

186
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,545
the members of my favorite band

187
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,546
right here in front of me!

188
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,247
I still can't believe it...

189
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,882
I'm so happy I became a fan!

190
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,684
[YUUJI] You're exaggerating.

191
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,319
[SAKURA] No, I'm not at all!

192
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,655
[SAKURA] I love Yumemishi.

193
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:25,659
The very first time I heard
Kuuga's voice...

194
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,127
[SAKURA] I was so happy...

195
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,363
my heart was racing so fast
I thought it'd never stop.

196
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,600
<happy>

197
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,403
So what if I'm not as excited

198
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,940
as she is to be here?

199
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,376
[MISAKI] Sakura really likes
this guy.

200
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,681
And if he makes her happy,
then I want to support her.

201
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,905
<water running>

202
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,007
[KOU] Still, she only brought
two friends with her...

203
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,376
[KOU] Guess there wasn't a point
in bringing those 20 tickets.

204
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,680
[KUUGA] Let's just quit doing
these stupid fan events. They're
a waste of time.

205
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,314
[KUUGA] We've got enough people
coming to our shows.

206
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,685
[KOU] But that one girl seems
really crazy about you, huh?

207
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:28,421
[KUUGA] Who cares.
That girl with the long,
straight hair's way hotter.

208
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,592
[KUUGA] She said her name was
Misaki, right?

209
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,494
That girl‐ she's the one I wanna
get with.

210
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:35,328
[TRIO] <shocked foley>

211
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,630
[SHIROKAWA] Misa?!

212
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,631
[KUROSAKI] "Get with her"?!

213
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,464
[SARASHINA] What the hell?!

214
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,766
What should we do?

215
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,635
Our Misa will be...!

216
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,368
<panicking>

217
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,403
<startled>

218
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:48,374
<increasingly fearful>

219
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,110
[MISAKI] A live show?

220
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,811
[KUUGA] Yeah!

221
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,912
What do you say, Misa!

222
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,446
It'll be a lot of fun, I
promise!

223
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,115
[MISAKI] Uh, sorry, but I don't
have

224
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,017
a lot of free time in my
schedule...

225
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,619
[KUUGA] And what about you?

226
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,853
[SHIZUKO] I'll pass, thanks.

227
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,022
[SAKURA] C'mon you guys!

228
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,624
[SAKURA] After all these tickets
are really hard

229
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,858
to get a hold of, aren't they
Kuuga‐

230
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,059
[KUUGA] Aw, don't be
like that, Misaki,

231
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,528
I'm sure you can find a way to
come!

232
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:08,929
[MISAKI] Huh?

233
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,964
Well I don't have a lot of money
either...

234
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,333
[KUUGA] Then I'll just give you
that ticket for free.

235
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,103
[KUUGA] You gotta come... won't
you, Misaki?

236
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,873
[MISAKI] Uh, well, that is, I...

237
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,074
[MISAKI] S‐Sakura, are you
going?

238
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,544
[SAKURA] Huh? Yeah, you bet I
am!

239
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:26,046
[YUUJI] Sakura you come to every
single show of ours, dontcha?

240
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,614
[MISAKI] Really? Every show?

241
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,950
Wow, Sakura, you're one devoted
fan!

242
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,753
She's always telling us about
you guys and how great you are.

243
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,220
[MISAKI] You really like them,
don't you?

244
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,757
[KUUGA] So, Misaki...

245
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,392
[KUUGA] Are you sure you can't
come to our live show?

246
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,061
Not even... for me?

247
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,166
[MISAKI] Is it my imagination?

248
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,370
I feel like that Kuuga
guy is only talking to me.

249
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,207
[MISAKI] What should I do about
Sakura?

250
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,111
[KUUGA] Hey there!

251
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,813
Wh‐what are you doing here?!

252
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,715
[KUUGA] Well, I thought you and
I

253
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,383
could have a nice little chat...

254
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,451
[MISAKI] Then we can do that
back at the table with
everyone else.

255
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,155
[KUUGA] Nah, it's cool.
The others are covering for me
with your friends.

256
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,726
[MISAKI] What are you saying?

257
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,328
You know how Sakura
feels about you, don't you?

258
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,631
[KUUGA] Yeah, but it's not like
I'm actually interested in her.

259
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,499
[MISAKI] Then why did you invite
her in the first place?!

260
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,903
[KUUGA] It was just a little
event for the fans, of course.

261
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,005
[KOU] But that girl seems pretty
serious.

262
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,707
She's gonna end up getting hurt.

263
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,276
[KUUGA] So what? I can't
hang out with every single
one of my fans.

264
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,377
I have to decide who makes the
cut.

265
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,546
[MISAKI] But that's‐

266
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,447
[KUUGA] It's what?

267
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,017
[KUUGA] It's kindness, really.

268
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,520
I reject them right away
and let'em down nice and easy.

269
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,922
[KUUGA] They're just gonna end
up getting hurt either way,

270
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,224
so better sooner than later,
right?

271
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,626
[MISAKI] What're you saying...?

272
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:46,860
[KOU] Hey!

273
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,094
[KUUGA] Still...

274
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,431
[KUUGA] If YOU became a fan...

275
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:53,166
[KUUGA] I'd make an exception.

276
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,871
[USUI] My apologies for the
wait.

277
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,174
I'd be delighted tp take your
orders.

278
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,909
[MISAKI] U‐! Usui! What are you
doing here?!
[USUI] Oh, so sorry, sir.

279
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,077
[MISAKI] U‐! Usui!
What are you doing here?!

280
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,612
[KUUGA] Who the heck
is this guy?!

281
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:06,947
Do you know him, Misaki?!

282
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,181
[KOU] He's her boyfriend isn't
he?

283
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,883
At least, judging by
the timing he is.

284
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,752
[MISAKI] N‐no! Not at all!
You're way off!

285
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,486
[KUUGA] What, then?!

286
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,188
[USUI] Her stalker, of course.

287
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,926
[KUUGA] Is there another waiter
we can talk to?

288
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,227
[MISAKI] Uh, no no! It's fine,
really!

289
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,763
He's a not a stalker he's a...

290
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,865
[MISAKI] He's a stalker but NOT
a stalker.

291
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,601
Uh, that is, I mean... Geez I
don't know what I mean... But
really, it's‐

292
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:32,005
[KUUGA] Whatever.
This is too weird for me.
Enjoy yourselves.

293
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,578
[USUI] A stalker but not a
stalker, huh? Then what?

294
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:38,812
<embarassed>

295
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,113
Anyway, what do you
think you're doing?

296
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,715
And since when did you start
working here?

297
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,283
[USUI] I don't work here.

298
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,118
[MISAKI] Then where'd you get
that uniform from...?

299
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,687
[SHIROKAWA] Just let it all out.

300
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:47,788
[USUI] Well, I just happened to

301
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,122
run into an associate of mine...

302
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,124
And I had the sudden urge
to take it off him.

303
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,127
[MISAKI] There's something
really wrong with you, isn't
there?

304
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,529
[USUI] It couldn't be helped.

305
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,632
There are some things that
just really irritate me.

306
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,067
[MISAKI] Well just because
they're irritating

307
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,837
doesn't mean you can do whatever
you want‐

308
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,908
[USUI] On top of that, I'm VERY
possessive.

309
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,443
Especially around guys like
that.

310
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:11,377
[MISAKI] That...!

311
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,980
That's got nothing
to do with you!

312
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,415
[MISAKI] Don't get the wrong
idea.

313
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,417
The only reason I'm here,
is because of Sakura...

314
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,419
[SAKURA] I'm totally crazy about
him!

315
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,254
[SAKURA] That's why I really
want you to come

316
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,590
so I can introduce you to him.

317
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,825
[MISAKI] Sakura was...

318
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,528
she was really looking forward
to this...

319
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,329
then this happened...

320
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,700
[USUI] What a face you're
making, Ayuzawa.

321
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,169
[MISAKI] I can't help it.

322
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,506
I feel like I'm at a total
loss...

323
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,142
[MISAKI] I have no idea what the
best thing to do is...

324
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,978
[USUI] The best thing, huh?

325
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,147
[USUI] Nobody knows that, do
they?

326
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,191
<gasp>

327
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,636
[MISAKI] Why does he always do
that! Damnit.....

328
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,109
[KUUGA] Boooored...

329
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,744
[SAKURA] Um, Kuuga!

330
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,081
You'll be singing a new song at
your next live show, right?

331
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,816
[KUUGA] Yeah. Sure.

332
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,885
[SAKURA] I'm really looking
forward to it!

333
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,286
[KUUGA] Great...

334
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,722
[SAKURA] So then, what kind of
song is it gonna be?

335
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,123
[KUUGA] Well...

336
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,559
Oh, I'm sorry! I guess
I shouldn't have asked that!

337
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,827
<extended yawning>

338
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,395
[KUUGA] You know...

339
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,733
[SAKURA] Y‐yeah what is it?!

340
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,668
[KUUGA] Can't you find a way to
make it work out?

341
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,536
[SAKURA] Huh?

342
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:43,469
[KUUGA] With Misaki.

343
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,706
You guys are friends,
aren't you?

344
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,873
[SAKURA] Yeah...

345
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,209
Then get her
to come to our concert.

346
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,113
[SAKURA] Misaki... Misaki's
schedule is really busy.

347
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,915
She's Student Council President
and...

348
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:59,686
[KUUGA] No way! Misaki's the
student council president?
How cool!

349
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,922
[KUUGA] Not only is she cute,
but she's got brains, too.

350
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:07,961
[KUUGA] She knows how to dress
and think. She's pretty amazing,
huh?

351
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,229
[KUUGA] Say...

352
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,432
Come on, Sakura,
won't you ask her for me?

353
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,800
As a favor.

354
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,036
[KUUGA] What do you say?

355
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,071
<faint>

356
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,506
[KUUGA] What do you say?

357
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,278
[KUUGA] Oh, Misaki! Welcome
back!

358
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,983
[SAKURA] Hey, Misaki...

359
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,520
[SAKURA] I'd really like it
if you came to their next
concert with me.

360
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,354
[MISAKI] Huh?

361
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,656
I'll even help you out... with

362
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,958
your... student council
work if you want...

363
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,926
[MISAKI] S‐Sakura?

364
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:44,531
[SAKURA] It looks like...
It looks like Kuuga really
wants you to come, Misaki.

365
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,734
[SAKURA] The whole time you were
gone,

366
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,504
all he did was talk about you.

367
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,339
[SAKURA] It looks like Kuuga...
really likes you...

368
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,407
<mad>

369
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,877
<whistle>

370
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:58,411
[KUUGA] So Misaki, you're the

371
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,280
student council president, huh?

372
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,548
[KUUGA] Since you're such a hard
worker

373
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,349
you deserve a break
every now and then!

374
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,051
[KUUGA] If you can't go to the
concert,

375
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,521
how about we got to an amusement
park instead?

376
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,389
[KUUGA] You act
all‐straightlaced

377
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,292
but I bet you know
how to show a guy a good time.

378
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,727
[KUUGA] You're pretty smart,
too.

379
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,696
You probably play the
field quit a bit, don't you?

380
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,263
[KOU] Hey, Kuuga!

381
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,633
[KUUGA] Was that waiter from
earlier one of your boyfriends?

382
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,536
[KUUGA] You tryin' to show off
or something?

383
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:23,737
[SAKURA] Stop it...

384
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,438
[KUUGA] What's this?
Since you're not speaking up,

385
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,507
that means I'm right,
doesn't it?

386
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,641
[SAKURA] Please...

387
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,644
[KUUGA] Wow! Seika's
Student Council President

388
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:31,745
sure is a wild one.

389
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,379
[SAKURA] Stop it!

390
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,855
[SAKURA] Please don't...

391
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,358
Please don't talk about Misaki
like that, I'm begging you!

392
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,667
[KUUGA] What's this Sakura...

393
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,235
do you hate me now?

394
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,670
[KOU] That's enough, Kuuga!

395
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,072
I told you to be more
respectful to the fans!

396
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,441
[KUUGA] Yeah, yeah. I know, I
know.

397
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:04,377
[MISAKI] I've had enough.

398
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,582
[MISAKI] Is this the "kindness"
you were talking about?

399
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,985
[MISAKI] If you ask me, that's
the biggest load of crap I've
ever heard.

400
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,054
Get over yourself already.

401
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:18,525
Sakura was really looking
forward to this day, and you've
ruined it.

402
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,161
You trampled on her feelings
without any regard for her at
all...

403
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,264
[KUUGA] Uh oh! Do you hate me
now, too, Misaki?

404
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,198
I don't hate you.

405
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,867
I DESPISE YOU!

406
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,310
[MISAKI] I'll never hand Sakura
over... to a piece of trash like
you!

407
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:43,884
[MISAKI] I'm sorry...

408
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,251
It's too late for that!

409
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,486
How could you raise your voice

410
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,288
like that while inside of a
restaurant?!

411
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,623
[SHIZUKO] I don't care how angry
you are,

412
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,592
be more considerate of the
people around you!

413
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,094
[SHIZUKO] Misaki, your temper is
way too short!

414
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,662
[MISAKI] I... I'm sorry...

415
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,463
[SHIZUKO] And Sakura have you
forgotten

416
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,299
what I've told you so
many times before?!

417
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,801
[SHIZUKO] You're way too easily
deceived,

418
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,903
so you need to choose your
friends more wisely!

419
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:05,438
[SAKURA] Waaaaah... I thought he
was a good guy!

420
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,841
[SHIZUKO] Well he wasn't!
You need to learn to read men
better!

421
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,244
[MISAKI] I don't think I've ever
seen Shizuko get this intense
before...

422
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,447
[SHIZUKO] That's what you get
for putting me in that kind of
situation.

423
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,482
[SHIZUKO] My temper has its
limits, too, you know!

424
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,019
[SAKURA] Shizuko, you're not
nice at all!

425
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,286
[SHIZUKO] Because if I go easy
on you,

426
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,422
you'll never learn your lesson!

427
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,659
Shizuko... I think she's had
enough for one day.

428
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,296
[SAKURA] Misaki!

429
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,966
[MISAKI] Um, uh, don't cry,
everything'll be fine...!

430
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,786
[SAKURA] The next time I fall in
love

431
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:56,356
it'll be with someone who pats
my head just like this.

432
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,269
[MISAKI] Sakura... I hope you
find a good guy soon.

433
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,875
[MISAKI] Next time you fall in
love, it'll be with someone who
pats your head, huh?

434
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,713
[USUI] Finally. You're back.

435
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,883
[USUI] You're late, Miss
President.

436
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,666
[USUI] Did you hurt your head or
something?

437
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:43,169
[MISAKI] Huh? Oh, n‐no, it's
nothing!

438
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,038
[MISAKI] And what are you doing
hanging around over here?!

439
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,141
[USUI] Nothing to get worked up
about. Just being a stalker.

440
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,142
[MISAKI] Huh?!

441
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,376
[USUI] Since I'm a stalker,

442
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,178
maybe I should follow you to
your house.

443
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,880
[MISAKI] Go away!

444
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,856
[KOU] Now look what you've done,
Kuuga!

445
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,191
Can't you just act like an adult
for once?

446
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,693
[KUUGA] Lay off, Kou!

447
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,362
Quit talking like you're my dad
or something!

448
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,667
[SHOU] On a more important
note...

449
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,602
[SHOU] What's with those guys?

450
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:16,870
[TRIO] Hurry up and get the hell
out of here

451
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,606
before we kick you to the curb,
Masters!

452
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:52,432
[SAKURA] Shizuko! You'll go to
the next Yumemishi concert with
me, right?

453
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,768
[SHIZUKO] Huh?! Sakura,
you STILL haven't learned?!

454
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:57,103
[SHIZUKO] But if it's boring,
we're all going home together.

455
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,773
[SAKURA] So you WILL come with
me? Yay! Oh, Misaki!

456
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,008
[MISAKI] Huh, Sakura? Shizuko?
What are you doing?

457
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,444
[SHIZUKO] I thought we'd do the
next episode preview,
but it's difficult, isn't it?

458
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,212
[SAKURA] We were waiting for
you, Misaki!

459
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,582
[USUI] Glance.
[SAKURA] Misaki, would you like
to come to Yumemishi‐

460
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,717
[MISAKI] Ah, sorry, Sakura. I'll
catch up with you later.

461
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:14,487
[USUI] Glance, glance.
[SHIZUKO] Huh? Usui seems to be
glancing at something
interesting.

462
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,790
[USUI] Glance, glance, glance,
glance! [SAKURA] More like he
wants us to be interested in
HIM.

463
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,059
[MISAKI] I have a feeling this
is going to be a pain...
