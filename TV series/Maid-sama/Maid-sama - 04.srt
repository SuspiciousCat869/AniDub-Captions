1
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,963
Huh? Ma'am, you have
an older brother?

2
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,199
Mm‐hmm. But he's married
and has a kid,

3
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,835
so I don't get to see him
very often anymore.

4
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,203
Huh.

5
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,209
(Doorbell)

6
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,977
Welcome back, Mas‐

7
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,879
Oh... My Lady.

8
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,255
[CUSTOMER]
So cute!

9
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,924
[MISAKI]
Allow me to show you in.

10
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,126
[CUSTOMER]
That's no ordinary girl!

11
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,029
Yeah, I'm sure of it!

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,363
Excuse me, ma'am!

13
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,433
But are you...
by any chance Aoi?!

14
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,703
[BOY]
Oh! Aoi?!

15
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,339
[AOI]
My goodness.

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,176
I never imagined
I would have so many fans.

17
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,746
[BOY]
You really are her?

18
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,681
Aoi...

19
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,950
is so happy!

20
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,385
(Boys very excited)

21
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,820
[BOY]
Oh! It's really Aoi!

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,856
[SATSUKI]
What's going on over here?

23
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,157
Oh, Aunt Satsuki.

24
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,392
Aoi, it's you?!

25
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,601
[SATSUKI]
You want to work here?!

26
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,035
The boss's niece?

27
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,037
Her older brother's
daughter, apparently.

28
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,706
She's so cute!

29
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,076
What on Earth are you thinking?!
Of course you can't work here!

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,143
Why not?

31
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,344
What do you mean "why not"?!

32
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,746
You're still in middle school!

33
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,947
It's against the law.

34
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,082
And what about your
responsibilities?

35
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,650
I'm on a break
right now.

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,685
Ugh!

37
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,388
I've actually
been disowned again!

38
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,559
Wow, talk about
an incredible retort.

39
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,560
Ah!

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,695
Ma'am!

41
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,578
How incredibly exhibitionist.

42
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,847
The number of site visits
is kind of scary.

43
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,450
So does this mean she's
going to be staying with
you for a little while?

44
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,822
Yeah, I called my brother
earlier and he was still pretty
mad about the whole thing.

45
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,256
[AOI]
Oh!

46
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,058
I knew it would look good!

47
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,160
It suits me, right?
When can I start?

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,496
I only lent you that because
you kept whining that you
wanted to try one on.

49
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,798
You saw how popular I am!

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,200
With me here, you'll get
even more customers!

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,404
After all, right now
I'm the most famous
of all Internet idols!

52
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:03,276
And all men are absolutely
powerless against my spell.

53
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,714
Oh! I'd better take some
pictures for my blog.

54
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,984
We have a strict policy
the prohibits anyone
other than our employees

55
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,853
from wearing
one of our costumes.

56
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,320
Come on, just a selfie!

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,022
We might start getting
visits from customers

58
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,859
who think this is some kind
of costume rental shop.

59
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,362
Apparently, some other cafes
offer that service.

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,131
Hmph! Whatever‐

61
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,633
This dress looks
way better on me

62
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,268
than it does on
some girl off the street!

63
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,469
[SATSUKI]
Aoi!

64
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,937
What, you got a problem?!

65
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm way cuter than you are,
so why can't‐

66
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,210
You're very cute.
But no picturess allowed, okay?

67
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,645
Well, time to get to work.

68
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,982
Make sure to change
out of those, okay Aoi?

69
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,289
(Doorbell)

70
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,657
Wah!

71
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,330
Misa.

72
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,933
I'm back...

73
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,335
Welcome back, uh... Master.

74
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,970
[CUSTOMER]
Aoi's in a maid outfit!

75
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,406
It really suits her!

76
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,842
Aoi! What are you doing?!

77
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,644
Thank you!

78
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,812
Wait! Wait!

79
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,113
[AOI]
I knew it.

80
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,848
Out of all of them, I'm‐

81
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:15,949
Huh?

82
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,286
A new worker?

83
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,655
That's the boss' niece.

84
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,625
I told her she had
to change, but...

85
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,027
Who is that, Satsuki?

86
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,929
Who's that man that's
covered in pheromones?!

87
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,364
That man oozes sex appeal
from every pore!

88
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,799
Uh, well he's...

89
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,502
Getting a man like that
to fall for me

90
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,404
would be like
winning a trophy.

91
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,075
But Aoi, Usui and Misa
are kinda, y'know‐

92
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,544
They're going out?!

93
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:47,514
No, I don't think they're
actually together... yet.

00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,617
Manager! Manager!
Manager!

95
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,485
The cook just called
to say she is sick

96
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,387
and can't come in
for her shift tonight!

97
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,123
Huh? I already have my
hands full with Aoi!
[AOI] There's no need to worry.

98
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,360
Why did it have to be
today of all days?!
[AOI] A girl of such low caliber
could never be a threat to ME.

99
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,129
I've already called
everyone, trying to find
someone who can cover,

100
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,631
but no one's available!

101
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,466
Manager, is everything okay?

102
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,735
It's terrible!
We don't have a cook

103
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,571
and it's about to be
our busiest time!

104
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,774
Misa, can you cook?!
Please, we need your help!

105
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,776
Uh...

106
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,410
Should I help, too?
Huh?!

107
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,312
Huh? YOU, Usui?

108
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,115
Of course.
Leave the cooking to me.

109
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,351
B‐but we can't just use some
customer from the store!

110
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,787
Usui, get your butt in there!

111
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,921
But ma'am!

112
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,356
But first, you must pass
the omelette test!

113
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,058
Understood.

114
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,662
[SATSUKI]
Okay. You'll be judged by
your rice omelette.

115
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,731
The ingredients and amounts
are already laid out for you.

116
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,066
[MISAKI] Ma'am, can you please
just think about it‐
[SATSUKI] We have no
other choice!

117
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,068
[SATSUKI]
Go, Usui!

118
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,037
Well, here I go.

119
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,747
Whooa!

120
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,701
Woooooow!

121
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:20,106
[SATSUKI]
This omelette has the creamiest
eggs I've ever tasted...

122
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,009
[MISAKI]
Delicious!

123
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,711
You pass!

124
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,147
Gee, thanks.

125
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,582
(Giggles)

126
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:32,418
You cook just like
a professional.

127
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,954
Could you make something
just for me?

128
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,257
Sure, if you order it
from the cafÃ© menu.

129
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,594
Aoi, this guy is completely
depraved. Just ignore him.

130
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,195
You're so cruel, Misa.

131
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,065
But it excites me when you
insult me like that.

132
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,366
Don't touch me you freak!

133
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,834
Yes, yes.

134
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,844
Looks like Misa's
not here today.

135
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,445
Maybe we should
just go home...

137

Uh... What's this?!

138
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,417
Who's that?

139
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,886
It's Aoi, the famous net idol!

140
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,954
[SHIROKAWA]
You know her?

141
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,857
Geez, Ikkun, not only are you
a closet‐nerd but a fanboy, too.

142
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,559
So when you say "net idol"...

143
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,227
You mean she posts
a bunch of sexy pics?

144
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,663
Sounds like it's right up
your alley, Kurotatsu.

145
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,899
NO! Aoi is a
pure‐hearted angel!

146
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,202
But she does also have a bit of
a mischievous side, too!

147
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,841
Waaa! Ooh!

See, no man can resist me.
So why doesn't...?

Welcome back, Master.

00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,220
Hm?

152
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,593
Will you make a special
omelette just for me today?

153
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,861
I'm a customer today.

154
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,698
Then why don't we sit together?

No, thank you.

I haven't sat upstairs
in a while...

That man... He's gotta have
some sort of weakness!

I refuse to accept that he
prefers that unrefined

Huh? Hey, Aoi.

161
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,561
Misa, you can just
set those anywhere.

162
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,463
Got it.

163
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,265
The manager is out
right now, Aoi...

164
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,233
So? What're you
telling me for?

165
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,505
Uh... She should be
back soon, so you can
just have a seat and wait.

166
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,939
Just butt out.

167
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,076
Aoi, do you hate me?

168
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,478
Oh, whatever would
give you that idea?

169
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,481
Guess there's nothing
I can do. I'll just
leave her alone.

170
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,084
Feel free to do
whatever you want.

171
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,758
Wait! I want to ask
you something‐!

172
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,060
Uh?

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,228
What is it?

174
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,532
Y‐you're changing clothes.

175
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,301
Yeah. I'm done
for the day.

176
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,675
Hmm?

177
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,677
THOSE are your clothes?

178
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,978
Huh? Well, yeah.

179
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,980
You don't have a
shred of femininity!

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,915
Uh...

181
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,517
And you call yourself a woman?

182
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,185
Are these even girls' clothes?
Are they men's?!

183
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,955
I don't know. I just pick
whatever's cheapest...

184
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:25,158
You look tragic!
Don't you even want to be cute?!

185
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,194
I don't really care
about things like that.

186
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,032
(Sigh)

187
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,968
How did someone like you
manage to seduce Takumi Usui?

188
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,937
You have some secret
technique, don't you?!

189
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:37,938
Huh?

190
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,906
That's the only
logical explanation‐

191
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,643
after all no one can
resist my charms!

192
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,477
Besides, if I could catch
a man like that,

193
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,813
my cuteness would
become unstoppable!

194
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,449
Tell me right now!
What method did you use, woman?!

195
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,686
I didn't use any "method",
and I didn't "seduce" him!

196
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,254
Don't lie to me!

197
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:58,124
J‐just calm down...!
Here we go‐ Upsy‐daisy!

198
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,893
Ahh!

199
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,565
You super‐strong freak!

200
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,000
Uhh...

201
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,815
Will you let me try your
special rice omelette today?

202
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,857
Move it.

203
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,571
I'm going on break now.

204
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,172
See you in a bit.

205
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,914
What do you want from me?

206
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,151
I want you to be mine,
and mine alone.

207
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,157
Oh really?

208
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,862
Do you really know the
meaning of the words
you're saying, little girl?

209
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,300
(Gasp)

210
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,503
(Thud)

211
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,037
Huh?

212
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,979
What the...?

213
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:06,152
What the hell do you think
your doing, you freak?!

214
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,287
(Crash)

215
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,488
Huh?

216
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,826
Aoi...

217
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,566
That's enough of this!

218
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,967
What was that for?!

219
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,036
What are you thinking,
doing something like that?!

220
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,437
Quit trying to one‐up yourself!

221
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,807
Everyone already knows
how cute you are,

222
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,241
so why are you
doing this?

223
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,210
What exactly are you
trying to prove?!

224
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,213
Because they all
laughed at me!

225
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,816
Just because
I liked cute things!

226
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,119
But if I can make enough
people think I'm cute,

227
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,856
I'll finally be able to
get back at them!

228
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,391
Do you really believe that?

229
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,562
If you really want to get back
at them, then face them head‐on!

230
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:53,433
Be strong enough to take them
on alone, without dragging
anyone else into it!

231
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,473
I don't know what
you've gone through,

232
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,043
but I do know that
the people who laughed
at you back then

233
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,177
are sure to acknowledge...

234
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,648
how cute you
really are, Aoi.

235
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:10,917
Even if...
you're a boy.

236
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,353
What the...?

237
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,955
(Sigh)

238
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,262
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you...

239
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,231
But he would've gotten
super mad at me if I did.

240
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,069
You knew it the first time
you saw me, didn't you?

241
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,538
Is that true?

242
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,073
That's why he rejected me.

243
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,642
Huh?! Then what'd you
attack him for?

244
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,746
I just did exactly what
you told me to do and
confronted him face to face.

245
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,381
Shut up,
you pervert!

246
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,884
[USUI] Were you jealous, Misa?
[AOI] What a couple of weirdos.

247
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,819
[AOI] I figured they'd be
more surprised.
[MISAKI] Like hell! What is
there to be jealous about?!

248
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,854
Even though I'm a boy,
I like cute things,

249
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,523
and dressing up like a girl.

250
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,659
It's only natural that people
would laugh and be surprised.

251
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,361
Huh? What would
we laugh for?

252
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,632
When we found out,
we were a little
surprised, but...

253
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,602
those clothes
looked good on you!

254
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,170
Aoi, you've had enough
fun for one day, right?

255
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,206
Don't you think
it's time you...

256
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,508
I'm leaving.

257
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,476
Next time...

258
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,681
I'll be so perfect that
EVERYONE will fall at my feet!

259
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,849
He missed the point!

260
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,483
Looks like we're back
to square one.

261
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,221
I won't forget about
this, you weirdos!

262
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,356
What's with that
uppity parting shot?!

263
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,492
He completely ignored
what I told him!

264
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,161
Not quite...

265
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,933
I wonder if Aoi will
come today, too...?

266
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,668
I really hope she does...

267
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,903
My apologies for
the wait, Masters.

268
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,371
Ah!

269
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,541
These guys over here were
cheating on you with Aoi!

270
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,075
Wh‐what are you saying?!

271
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,910
I only have eyes
for you, Misa!

272
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,178
Oh look at the time‐

273
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,247
guess you better be
on your way, Masters.

274
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,048
Ah!

275
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,750
But we only just got here!

276
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,652
[MISAKI]
See you later, Masters.

277
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,720
Ahh!

278
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,423
(Gasp)

279
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:03,597
[SATSUKI]
Aoi, it's perfect!
A school uniform?! Good job!

280
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,265
Very, very, VERY good!

281
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,601
What a cute little
middle‐school boy you are!

282
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,504
Please dress like this
forever and ever and ever!

283
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:13,239
The only reason I'm in this
is because I don't have
anything else to wear.

284
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,241
Don't have anything
to wear? Why?

285
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,978
Satsuki, hurry up and give me
some of your old outfits‐

286
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,780
I need something decent to wear.

287
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,948
I'm guessing my brother threw
you out again, didn't he?

288
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,686
So Aoi's clothes were
actually hand‐me‐downs
he got from you?

289
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,120
That's right.

290
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,223
I did all of the alterations
and tailoring myself.

291
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,860
Wow‐ that's amazing!
You know how to sew, Aoi?

292
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,862
That's a great way
to save money.

293
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,230
(Shocked)

294
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,099
Thanks for all your
hard work today, Misa.

295
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,166
See you tomorrow.

296
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,236
You're dressed like that AGAIN?

297
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:48,174
Don't you understand how much
potential you're wasting?!

298
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,712
I can't take it anymore!
Come with me‐ NOW!

299
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:52,846
Bye bye!

300
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,715
Good luck, Misa.

301
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,524
Pink camisoles,
lace miniskirts...

302
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:08,762
sleeveless chiffon tops,
and loose balloon skirts!

303
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,899
Those are the kinds of clothes
that have "cuteness" written
all over them!

304
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,102
How can you not be
interested in things
like that?! Huh?

305
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,938
Uh, well I'm sorry...

306
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,608
Your lack of personal style,
your nonexistent fashion sense,

307
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,144
and your inability to put
effort into your appearance

308
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,813
is killing you
and pissing me off!

309
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,050
This is starting to feel
more like a personal attack
than a makeover...

310
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,585
Looks like I have no choice.

311
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,687
It's up to me to find you
some suitable clothes.

312
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,188
Wait a minute, Aoi!

313
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,291
I can't! I don't have
any money for clothes!

314
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,193
That's super cheap!

315
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:45,065
Lucky! I needed
a new notebook!
Uh...

316
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,767
Hello there, would you
like a free sample?

317
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,035
Free?! How many
can I take?
[GIRL] Just one, please.

318
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,037
Sorry, sorry. So, what
were we doing again?

319
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,807
Forget it.
Just hurry up already.

320
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,241
These're on sale right now.

321
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,477
But I can cut the price
if you buy a dozen!

322
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:01,214
Croquettes are my
sister's favorite!

323
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,155
[AOI]
I should've known trying
to give you a makeover
was a waste of time!

324
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,998
[MISAKI]
So, you went to school today?

325
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,635
If I stayed home,
I'd just feel smothered.

326
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,106
But, I guess it's
the same at school, too.

327
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,608
Why's that?

328
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,844
All they ever do is insult
all the things I like.

329
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,614
When it comes to things
that are pretty or cute...

330
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,649
Apparently, I'm not
allowed to like them,

331
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,918
because that's not what
boys are supposed to like.

332
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:42,188
That's why everyone hates me!
Why no one will ever like me!

333
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,891
[MISAKI]
Really? But I like you a lot.

334
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,192
Huh?!

335
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,629
I think your personality's
refreshing, Aoi.

336
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,231
Yeah, well I hate you,
you man‐woman!

337
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,666
(Laughing) I know.

338
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,001
D‐don't tell me‐ are you
actually a masochist?!

339
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,670
You seem like a sadist!
Huh?

340
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,339
Look, I'm not into any of
that weird stuff, got it?!

341
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,175
Don't say that
kind of thing so loudly...!

342
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:17,758
This sucks.
Why does the weatherman
always get it wrong?

343
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,426
Aoi, don't you have
a handkerchief
or something?

344
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,462
I have one, but I
don't want to use it.

345
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,865
It's my favorite,
the design's super cute.

346
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:27,433
Hmm...

347
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,870
I guess I'll just have to
wipe you off with mine then!

348
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,972
[WOMAN]
Hey! Help me someone!

349
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:34,340
That man stole my purse!

350
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,176
Stop right there!

351
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,044
Hand it over, or else!

352
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,782
Huh?! What does she
think she's doing?!

353
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:45,185
If you're not going to stop,
then I guess I'll have
to MAKE YOU!

354
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,757
Ah!

355
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,332
(Police sirens)

356
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:14,414
That guy was HUGE,
but you took him on anyway!

357
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:18,151
For a girl you're
way too reckless!

358
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,886
Because I'm not a "normal" girl?

359
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,790
Or because for a woman,
I'm "too strong and too manly"?

360
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,392
Sorry but that's just
the kind of person I am.

361
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,294
I didn't meant
to make you worry.

362
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,296
A lot of people
get angry at me for it;

363
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,432
they tell me I need
to be more ladylike.

364
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:37,237
But, I think it's better to be
the person who you really are,

365
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,272
in my opinion...

366
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,414
That's the kind of excuse
I'd expect from a girl

367
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:51,217
who doesn't even
know the meaning of
the word "feminine"!

368
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,385
Uh...

369
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,120
If you don't clean
yourself up a bit,

370
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,022
you'll cry when he
abandons you in the end.

371
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,058
Uh... When who does?

372
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:59,292
Takumi Usui.

373
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,895
We don't have that
kind of relationship.

374
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,496
But he likes you.

375
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,299
No, he doesn't!
He just enjoys
making fun of me!

376
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,870
That guy's a weirdo.

377
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,540
Y'know, somehow
I can't help but feel
sorry for the guy...

378
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,207
Huh?

379
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,543
It's nothing at all.

380
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:17,944
AH! Your sleeve is ripped!

381
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,345
Oh... Oh no!

382
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,514
That's what you get
for buying cheap crap.

383
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,048
Tell me your size.

384
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:22,983
Huh?

385
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,250
I'll make you something.

386
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,352
Make me something?
You mean, like clothes?

387
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,221
Yeah.
Hey!

388
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:31,157
You've got good looks at least,
so I'll figure something out.

389
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,059
No, that's okay!

390
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm doing it!

391
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,462
I said it's fine!

392
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,569
(Gasps)

393
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:52,713
Uh... Somehow this seems
a little off, right?

394
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,215
You got a problem with
my sense of style?!

395
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,750
But you look
so cute, Misa!

396
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,685
Maybe we could do
a Lolita Day...

397
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,453
You look
surprisingly cute...

398
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:01,655
That's for sure!

399
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,626
What're you looking at?!
Just laugh and get it over with!

400
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,393
If you've got something
to say, then say it!

401
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,696
Whenever you're embarassed
you get really animated

402
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,932
and look even cuter
than normal.

403
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,537
[MISAKI]
Get out of here,
you stupid pervert!

404
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,799
[MISAKI]
It sure is hard wearing
clothes you're not used to.

405
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,168
Wait, didn't you and
the others take some photos?

406
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,603
[SATSUKI]
Of course! Click, click!

407
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,705
I took lots of photos that
will serve as keepsakes!

408
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,808
[AOI]
It's because I made it.
It really suited her, huh?

409
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,476
[USUI]
Yeah. I got really excited.

410
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,278
[MISAKI]
Shut up Usui, you idiot!

411
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:08,649
[HONOKA]
I forgot! I have to get to the
mall before it closes. See you!

412
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:10,517
[MISAKI]
Good night, Honoka.

413
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:11,952
[SUBARU]
I have to get to
my next job, so...

414
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:14,387
[MISAKI]
That's fine, Subaru.
I'll stay behind.

415
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:15,556
[USUI]
I'm a little worried.

416
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,624
[SUBARU]
Misa, I'm sorry.
