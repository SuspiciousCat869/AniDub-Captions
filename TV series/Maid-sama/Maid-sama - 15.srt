1
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,932
You're the one person,
I'd never want to hate me.

2
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,002
Heh... There you go again.

3
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:49,510
You're always making fun of me.
You really piss me off... you
know that?

4
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,146
[MISAKI]
But, I'm... I'm so
grateful to you...

5
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,449
I wonder if I'll...
forget about that, too.

6
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:04,157
I still haven't repaid you...
for everything... for all the
things you've done for me...

7
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,261
[USUI]
That's fine. Even if
you never repay me,

8
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,496
I'll help you
whenever you need.

9
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,334
And I will make you fall in love
with me, over and over again.

10
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,672
[USUI]
Just leave it to your "Master."

11
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,809
Heh. N‐now you're just...
talking stupid... dummy.

12
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,984
[KANOU]
23 hours, 55 minutes.

13
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:35,488
Just five minutes were left to
go. But it would appear that I
am the victor.

14
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:41,795
Heh. So much for being
the president's knight
in shining armor, Usui.

15
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:47,400
Looks like this little game of
ours is over, now that she truly
hates you‐

16
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,602
Kanou.

17
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,004
You really want to
try "playing" with me?

18
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:55,275
[KANOU]
Ah! I‐It's no use bluffing!
You can't threaten me now.

19
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,412
A‐yu‐zawa's already fallen
asleep! And when she wakes up‐

20
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,982
Who said I was asleep, Kanou?

21
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:08,321
Listening to Usui carry on
like some pervert... just
made me even angrier.

22
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,091
There's no way I could've gone
to sleep even if I wanted to!

23
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,959
(shocked)

24
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,360
[MISAKI] Kanou!
[KANOU] Gah!

25
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,296
You've pushed me so far

26
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,666
that I couldn't care less
about why you hate girls...

27
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:26,507
[MISAKI]
But don't worry... cause
I know exactly how I'm
gonna make you pay.

28
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,610
(frightened)

29
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,919
[SHIROKAWA]
"Notice of Open Campus."

30
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,557
[KUROSAKI]
Oh, that thing? They do it
every year for the junior
high schoolers, and...

31
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,191
[CLUB MEMBER A]
The battle is almost upon us!

32
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,360
[CLUB MEMBER B]
Recruit men of honor!

33
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,796
[CLUB MEMBER C]
Find the next star player!

34
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,298
Well, looks like we've
got the day off.

35
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,734
It's really only to
promote club activities.

36
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,369
Guess we can head
home for the day.

37
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,904
Actually, it looks like
they're doing a lot

38
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,407
besides just club
activities this year.

39
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,977
"Seven mysteries"?

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,046
"Relaxation Areas"?

41
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,415
[TRIO]
Huh? "Cafeteria staff"?

42
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,452
[SAKURA]
This looks like fun!
Cafeteria stuff!

43
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,688
We certainly have a lot
of activities this year.

44
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,890
I'd like to make the
cafeteria into a cute place,

45
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,760
somewhere that the visiting
students can rest...

46
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,664
I want it to be a place that
the middle school girls can
really feel at home in.

47
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,032
Getting everything prepared
is gonna be tough,

48
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,803
so we'll need as many people as
we can get. Will you guys help?

49
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,337
[GIRL A]
Of course!

50
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,139
[GIRL B]
I'll try asking some of
the other girls, too.

51
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,374
Thanks a lot.

52
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,809
I can't wait to meet
all the new girls!

53
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,744
What kind of decorations
should we do?

54
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,946
We will also have to be
sure to keep the budget
in mind as well...

55
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:44,050
[MISAKI]
So... Well if you girls need
help with anything at all,

56
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,053
no matter how easy or difficult
or embarrassing it might be...

57
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,690
make sure to use
this guy right here.
(KANOU scared)

58
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,058
Everyone meet first‐year
student, Soutarou Kanou.

59
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:57,564
Due to a very poor life decision
on his part, he's now working as
my personal errand boy.

60
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,466
Hey! You're the guy we
saw in the hall other day.

61
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,003
You're always wearing
that hood, aren't you?

62
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,671
[GIRL C]
He must be the quiet type.

63
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,573
[SAKURA]
Thanks for giving
us a hand, Kanou.

64
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,542
[GIRL A] Thanks!
[SHIZUKO] Thank you very much.

65
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,077
[SAKURA]
Well, girls, what do you say
we go round up the others?

66
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,746
[GIRL A]
So, what should we do?

67
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,180
Hmph...

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,884
(school bell ringing)

69
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,386
[GIRL B]
Where should we start?

70
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,555
[GIRL C]
I say we dress as boys.

71
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,891
(GIRLS laughing)
[GIRL B] As boys?

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,327
[YUKIMURA]
Uhm, Kanou...? I'm not really
sure what's going on,

73
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:32,132
but Miss Ayuzawa said if
you do a good job today,
all will be forgiven.

74
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:35,536
Oh! By the way,
I'm Yukimura,
the vice president.

75
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,904
Ah! Where are you going, Kanou?

76
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,707
(demonic growling)

77
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,978
Kanou...

78
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,283
Hey, Kanou! Can you give us
a hand with these boxes?

79
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,585
[KANOU] Gaahhh!
[OTHERS] Huh?

80
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,121
(demonic growling and
KANOU freaking out)

81
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,492
[KOSUGI]
President, if we do that,
then this here will...

82
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,662
[MISAKI]
Fine. Use the chemistry room...

83
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,066
[KANOU, thinking]
Looks like she's finally gone.
Now's my chance to escape...!

84
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,968
(demonic growling)

85
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:12,305
[YUKIMURA]
Just how many Presidents are
there?! Did she make clones of
herself?

86
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:16,743
No, there's just
one... I think.

87
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:22,015
[MISAKI, thinking]
It's strange... Watching
Kanou like this, something
seems a little off.

88
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,352
True, he avoids girls, but
there's no hatred in his eyes.

89
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,289
It doesn't look like he's afraid
of them either.

90
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,092
[GIRL A]
I wonder if we can do something
about that wall over there...

91
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,060
[GIRL B]
Oh, yeah... probably so...

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,329
(GIRL stumbling and knocking
furniture around)

93
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,966
(GIRL gasps)
[KANOU] Oh...

94
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,402
[GIRL B]
I'm sorry! I tripped
on that chair.

95
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,137
[GIRL B] Thank you.
(KANOU embarrassed)

96
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,945
Misa's off
AGAIN today?

97
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,447
Idiot! We come here
whether Misa's here or not!

98
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,518
That's what true love's
all about! Idiot!

99
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,053
(sigh) Yeah,
that's true...

100
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,155
Even Usui's here today...

101
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,597
Hey sis, I brought you this.
It's some turmeric tea

102
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,633
and chestnut candy
I won in a contest.

103
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,136
Thanks. Just leave it
over there please.

104
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,572
[SUZUNA]
Are you getting ready for the
open campus?

105
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,641
It sounds like
a lot of fun.

106
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,943
Uh? Hey, Suzuna
what would make YOU

107
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,778
want to enroll in
a certain high school?

108
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,446
Well, it would definitely‐

109
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,281
Ah! And you can't say,

110
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,484
"One with a Sweepstakes
Club." Try and think of
something else, okay?

111
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,087
Something else.

112
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:40,927
[SUZANA] Something else...
Um... Ummm uh... Let's see...
[MISAKI] What could it be? What
could it be? What could it be?

113
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,864
One with a Gift
Application Club.

114
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,168
[MISAKI]
Guess I should've known better.

115
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,573
[YUKIMURA]
Kanou, a little
more to the right!

116
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,675
Oh, the left side is
drooping a little now.

117
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,711
It looks like you're
working hard, Kanou.

118
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,647
So it's finally
tomorrow, huh?

119
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,148
Misaki. Please
come take a look.

120
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,920
I'd like to use these...
for our cosplay costumes.

121
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,923
(MISAKI stunned)
[SAKURA] (giggles)
Aren't they great!

122
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,058
[SHIZUKO]
It took a lot of work
to get these prepared.

123
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,195
[GIRL A]
Our teacher said they
looked nice, too.

124
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,963
[SAKURA]
Are they no good, Misaki?

125
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,568
[MISAKI, thinking]
No... This... This could be
exactly what we need!

126
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,770
[MISAKI]
It's all right.

127
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,371
Wear these and do your best!

128
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,508
Yaay!

129
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,180
(excited chatter)

130
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,150
Next up is the school tour.

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,086
What's this? Looks like
it's split up into
different "courses."

132
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,889
Today our students
will serve as your
guides around campus.
[GIRLS] Huh?

133
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:47,260
[MISAKI] I'm sure you're all
interested in seeing different
things,
[ARAMAKI] Anyone interested in

134
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,930
[Misaki] so for each course
there's a different tour.
[KOSUGI] This way for fine arts!

135
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,365
[MISAKI] Please choose the one
that interests you the most!
[BOY] They even have a
"Relaxation Area" course.

136
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,001
[GIRL A]
Sounds like fun! Which
one should we do first?

137
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,203
[GIRL B]
And an "Explore the Seven
Mysteries" course.

138
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,272
[MISAKI]
And also, for anyone who doesn't
know what course to take

139
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,576
or wants to have an
all‐around tour, please
step right this way.

140
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,711
We're here to answer all
of your questions!

141
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,580
[BOY A]
Okay, Group 1 is moving out.

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,115
[BOY B]
Can we get some more
help over here?

143
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,018
Well, everyone‐ Whaddaya
say we head out too?

144
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,588
Time for the "Request and
Answers on Demand" course.

145
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,557
Okay!

146
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,896
Misa's not here today
either, this is the worst...

147
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,632
Yeah, there's no point in coming
if our sweet Misa isn't here...

148
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,168
How many times do I
have to say it?

149
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,606
We come whether she's here or
not, because that's true love!
Check it out!

150
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,741
Even Usui's...

151
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,879
[TRIO]
He's not here!

152
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,314
Oh, my. What's the
matter, Masters?

153
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,883
Are you feeling down today?

154
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,019
I think she's forgotten
all about us.

155
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,422
But we'll never
forget about her!

156
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,958
As an apology for Misa
being off for today,

157
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,629
you'll have the entire Maid
Latte staff here to wait on you.

158
00:09:55,729 --> 00:10:02,335
(together)
We're at your service, Masters.
Please relax... and let us
know... if you need anything.

159
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,605
Is this real life?

160
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,106
I could die and
go to heaven!

161
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,474
I'm floating!
I'm floating!

162
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,744
Also, as an extra special treat,

163
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,848
I'd like to introduce you to...
our lovely kitchen staff!

164
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,651
Thank you for being
such loyal customers.

165
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,086
Sorry, this is my first
time out on the floor.

166
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,955
I don't really know
what to say...

167
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,357
No, no, don't
worry about it.

168
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:30,030
Thank god. I was worried
that they had some strange
lifeform cooking back there.

169
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,867
Okay, you idiots!
Let's order up a storm!
I'm paying for this one!

170
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,738
And I'll write up how
I feel about it in the
customer guestbook!

171
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,841
Ooh, good idea!
Do your best, Ikkun!

172
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,143
Then I'll compose a poem
brimming with perversion‐

173
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,046
I mean, emotion and
Misa'll love it for sure!

174
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,249
Okay! Then I'll reflect
on all of my fondest memories

175
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,185
with Misa over and over
in my head! Woohoo!

176
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,220
What would you like
on your omelette today?

177
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,089
How about "You suck"?

178
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,325
You're being a nuisance to
the other Masters, so would
you please be quiet?

179
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,829
It would be great if you left
and never came back, Masters.

180
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,731
Isn't she the best?
(TRIO in awe)

181
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,166
She sure is.

182
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,202
Does anyone else get the
feeling she hates us...?

183
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,541
[HAGIMOTO]
The Second Mystery of Seika is,
sometimes, when no one's around,

184
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,278
you can hear a ghostly
tune coming from the
Broadcasting Room!

185
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,948
[MISAKI, thinking] Right now,
everything is running smoothly.
[GIRL] What's that all about?
A cursed song?

186
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,617
But... it looks like the sports
clubs are...

187
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,285
[BOY A] I'm telling you,
the sandbag is fun!

188
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,521
[BOY B] Nothing builds
closeness like tackling!

189
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:28,922
[BOY C] The ball is your friend!

190
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,425
[MISAKI, thinking]
...completely striking out. Uh?

191
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,961
Hey, you over there!

192
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,431
How rude. I'm not a stranger.

193
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,701
[Misaki] If you're just going
to stand around and do nothing
(GIRLS squealing)

194
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,703
then why even bother coming
to school on a day off?

195
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:46,740
Hey! I'm helping you
out right now by being
your pillar of support.

196
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,474
Don't you find my
presence reassuring?

197
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,876
MORE LIKE ANNOYING!

198
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,512
Your "presence" is way
too much of a distraction!

199
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,379
Can't you find somewhere
else to go?

200
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,417
(confused)
What do you want me to do about
it? It's not like it's my fault.

201
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:02,088
Hmmm... Actually, I just thought
of the perfect job for you.

202
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,159
[BOY A]
No one wants to be
friends with the ball...

203
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,261
[MISAKI]
Hey, soccer club cheer up!

204
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,397
Usui said he'd LOVE to be
friends with the ball!

205
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,733
Huh. That's news to me.

206
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,100
Usui wants to?

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,802
[BOY A] Well come on
down here with us!

208
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,238
[BOY B] Here, have a ball!
[BOY C] Show us a cool shot!

209
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,373
[BOY A] Hey junior high
students! If you want to see
something REALLY awesome come
over here!

210
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,742
[BOY B]Step right up!
[BOY C] Let's get you a uniform.

211
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,176
Huh? The soccer club?

212
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,978
They're using Usui to
help get new recruits?!

213
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,412
Our club needs him too!

214
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,449
(MOB screaming)

215
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,255
Well, guess that's that.
Make sure to help out the
sports clubs to the best
of your ability.

216
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,923
'Kay?

217
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,831
W‐wait just a minute! I
couldn't! I CAN'T greet
the visitors!

218
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,700
[GIRL A]
C'mon, don't say that.

219
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,370
[GIRL B]
Yeah, come on‐ we have a costume
ready for you and everything!

220
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,039
Y‐you girls just go on
and have fun without me!

221
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,941
We couldn't possibly do
something like that.

222
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,877
Yeah, after all, if
it wasn't for you

223
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,845
we never could've gotten
this done. Right?

224
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,548
[SAKURA]
Let's all have fun together!

225
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,552
[GIRL A]
You've helped us out
so much, Kanou.

226
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,954
[GIRL B]
Though you did run away
a lot at first...

227
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,523
[GIRL C]
Leave the customers to us‐

228
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,992
all you need to worry about is
setting the tables, Kanou.

229
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,795
[GIRL D]
And if anything happens, we'll
be here to back you up.

230
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,131
See! Look at what a good
time Yukimura's having!

231
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,600
Hm? Gahhhh!

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,236
Kanou...

233
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:28,642
Don't worry, Kanou. We've got
the perfect costume for you‐
you'll LOVE it... (evil giggles)

234
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,944
(KANOU freaking out)

235
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,356
(whistle blowing)

236
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,561
Come on everybody,
let's play soccer!

237
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,997
Be friends
with the ball!

238
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,334
Usui! Come over to
the baseball club next!
[BASEBALL Club, chanting]
Usui, Usui!

239
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,905
[MISAKI] Has everyone been
enjoying themselves so far?
[GIRL A] Yeah!

240
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,575
[GIRL B]
They let us mess around with all
the supplies in the art room,

241
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,110
and even showed us how to play
guitar in the music room.

242
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,580
I never imagined we'd
have so much fun!

243
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,450
I'm glad to hear it. Make
sure to enjoy your stay, okay?

244
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,557
[CROWD] Whoa! Huh?

245
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,259
[PING PONG MEMBER]
Please come to the
ping pong club!

246
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,562
(CROWD in awe)

247
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,598
[GIRL A]
All the tours end at the
cafeteria, don't they?

248
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,800
I thought you might be tired
from all that walking,

249
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,936
so this is your chance to
rest and ask any remaining
questions you might have.

250
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,439
Feel free to talk
to some of senior
students, too.

251
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,941
Okay!

252
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,244
Hey there, come on in!

253
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,946
Please take whichever
seat you'd like.

254
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,083
(in awe) It's just
like a maid cafÃ©!

255
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,619
Make sure to rest up and have a
good time.

256
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,221
Misaki! Yaay!
What do you think?

257
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,624
Y‐You're so
cute, Sakura!

258
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,425
Misaki, you should
wear one, too!

259
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,627
Definitely not.

260
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,863
A‐anyway... It looks like
things are going great.

261
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,231
(cafeteria chatter)

262
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,433
Yeah, everyone's
having a good time!

263
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:03,203
Though to be honest, some
seem hesitant or afraid.

264
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,806
But if you just talk
to them a bit, they
open right up!

265
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:09,142
[SAKURA] C'mon, take
a little break!
[BOY] Oh, she's pretty nice.

266
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,411
At first I thought the boys
would simply laugh at us,

267
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:13,847
but they truly seem to be
enjoying themselves.

268
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,216
Not only them but
the girls as well.

269
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,320
It would be wonderful
if every day were like
this, wouldn't it?

270
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,491
Uh... It sure would...

271
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:30,631
Having a fun time together
is really wonderful,
don't you think?

272
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:35,301
(thinking) Yeah. Especially
like this... Right?

273
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,606
Well, I'm going to take another
look around, I'll see you guys
later‐

274
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,676
Oh, whoa!
(shock)

275
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,552
Don't you look
cute today, Kanou.

276
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,655
It's not my fault! I
was surrounded by girls
with no way to escape!

277
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,423
Oh really? You sure you're
not enjoying yourself?

278
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,994
YOU'RE WRONG! This
is exactly why I
can't stand girls!

279
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,896
How is this costume "perfect"
for me?

280
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,866
And what's with this stupid cap?
Why do I have to be a rabbit?!

281
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,435
What in the world are you
women thinking?! And what's
with all the maid outfits?

282
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,573
Are they always this
wishy‐washy?! I don't
understand it!

283
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:16,009
[KANOU] Just what kind
of creatures are they?!
[MISAKI, thinking] When it comes
to girls, this guy is...

284
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,580
[KANOU]
Women... Women are
just so breakable...

285
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:26,352
Kanou, seems you can
look us in the eye when
talking now. Heh.
Huh?

286
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,990
These past couple of days you
saw for yourself, didn't you?

287
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,028
[MISAKI]
Do you really think that's true?
Have the girls really been as
weak and fragile as you thought?

288
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,864
Kanou!

289
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,601
You don't have to run
away anymore, Kanou.

290
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:50,143
This is the first time...
I've ever been around girls
like this.

291
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,679
[BOY] Point!
(KENDO CLUB cheering)

292
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,180
[JR. HIGH BOY] Dammit!
[KENDO CLUB] Don't go looking
down on us high schoolers!

293
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,649
Usui! Come to
our club next!

294
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:56,482
No, ours!

295
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:03,056
(CLUBS arguing)

296
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,057
(silence)

297
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,125
[USUI]
I've had enough.

298
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,260
(CLUBS stunned)

299
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,196
[BOY]
O... okay...

300
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,437
[GIRL A]
Maybe we should go with Seika.

301
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:21,474
Huh? A‐are you girls thinking
about enrolling at Seika?!

302
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:22,342
That's wonderful!

303
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,678
[MISAKI]
So you like it here?!

304
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,048
Yes! Uh, but I... Oh, gosh!

305
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,550
[MISAKI]
Wh‐What is it?

306
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,886
[GIRL A]
The truth is, I'm not
very good with boys.

307
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,721
They're kinda scary.

308
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:38,058
[GIRL B]
She's only ever been in
all‐girls environments.

309
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,562
[GIRL C]
The only reason she came today
was because we asked her to.

310
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,531
[GIRL A]
There are a lot of boys
at Seika, aren't there?

311
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,267
I wish it was a
girls‐only school...

312
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,473
[YOUNG KANOU]
Dad! What do you mean,
Mom "broke" and went away?

313
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:58,044
[KANOU'S FATHER]
Soutarou! Women are
more delicate and
fragile than you think!

314
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,113
You gotta
watch how you handle women,

315
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,715
or they'll break on you.

316
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,249
(sobbing)
Mooom!

317
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,952
If they're gonna break,
I'll never go near them again!

318
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:09,322
[YOUNG KANOU] Girls are scary!
[KANOU] I understand.
I understand now.

319
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,558
[KANOU]
My mom didn't "break"...

320
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:15,395
She was just sick of the
way my father treated her,
so she left...

321
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,297
I've known... the whole time!

322
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,832
[SAKURA]
Oh, there you are!

323
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,767
Hey, Kanou!

324
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,402
Come here for a minute.

325
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:26,607
[KANOU] But right now, I'm‐
[SAKURA] It's fine, just
come on!

326
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:30,343
[KANOU, thinking]
I've known this for
a long time now...

327
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,145
Still, I didn't think
I could go near them.

328
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,347
(YOUNG KANOU crying)

329
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,982
[KANOU] If I got too close...

330
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,520
I thought something painful
would happen, like back then.

331
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,025
Because women are
weak and fragile.

332
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,195
[MISAKI]
Have these girls really been as
weak and fragile as you thought?

333
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:57,604
Guys are no good, huh? That
does make things pretty tough...

334
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,740
[MISAKI] Okay then.
[GIRLS] Huh?

335
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,307
Is THIS guy scary?

336
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,977
[KANOU] Uh...
[GIRL A] Oh! Well...

337
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,812
[MISAKI]
Hey, Bunny Boy!

338
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:09,315
Show them you're not scary!

339
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,518
[MISAKI] Take a good look.
[KANOU] AH! Huh?

340
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,490
You see? He's not scary at all.

341
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,530
Right?

342
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,331
Uh, yeah...

343
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,202
[MISAKI]
You don't have to
run away anymore.

344
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,307
[KANOU] Very well.
[MISAKI] Huh?

345
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,510
(HAPPY)
Ahhh!

346
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,281
I will now cast a magic spell.

347
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,518
Please close your eyes.

348
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,255
Listen to my voice.

349
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,157
From now on you are...

350
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,094
(thinking) I am...
(spoken) ...no longer afraid!

351
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,829
(clap)

352
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,408
(GIRL chuckling)
(GIRLS laughing)

353
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,344
It worked! I don't feel
scared at all! Heh.

354
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,380
[GIRL B] That's
cause it's magic!
[GIRL A] Yeah...

355
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,416
[GIRL C] That was cute!
[GIRL B] Mhmmm

356
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,085
[GIRL C] And those bunny
ears are funny!

357
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,822
(courtyard chatter)

358
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,825
Looks like you know some cute
magic tricks, don't you...

359
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,527
...Bunny Boy?

360
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,929
Oh, once you're done with
that, you can head out.

361
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,297
Okay.

362
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:36,903
[MISAKI]
Kanou, good job today.
As promised, everything
is forgiven.

363
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,372
Be safe on your way home 'kay?

364
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,777
Um, Miss Presi‐!

365
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,013
Huh?

366
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,916
You did a good job, too...

367
00:20:55,889 --> 00:21:00,093
Uh... Thanks for your hard
work, we couldn't have done
it without you.

368
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:04,364
[MISAKI]
I wonder where we're going... I
wonder if you'll let me down...

369
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:09,636
I wonder why you won't say
anything... Uh, Usui?
(hitting the ground) Gah!

370
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,642
[USUI]
Feeling satisfied?
With your punishment.

371
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,978
Uh, yeah, that's already
taken care of...

372
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:22,516
Oh, really? Then maybe you
wouldn't you mind giving
ME a little thanks, too.

373
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,485
You didn't come check on me
once. Man, I'm exhausted.

374
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,721
Well‐ if it wasn't for
you Usui the sports clubs

375
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,923
would've crashed and burned!
You really saved the day!

376
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,958
And for that I'm very grateful!

377
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,694
Mhmm...

378
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:36,597
No good?

379
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:38,932
That doesn't make me
feel better at all.

380
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,202
Can't you think of something
that would make YOU happy?

381
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,639
Uh... eeeeeeeh?!

382
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,912
[USUI] Huh?
[MISAKI] You...

383
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,415
You did very well today.

384
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,685
Ayuzawa...

385
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,357
[USUI]
So can I ravage you now?

386
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,391
You idiot!

387
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,360
(whining)

388
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,829
[KANOU]
Yukimura...

389
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,765
Out of everyone, I really do
respect you most of all.

390
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,467
I can't believe not a
single person noticed
you're really a man.

391
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:18,238
You've got it wrong, Kanou!
I want to change, but I can't
find my uniform!

392
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,840
[SAKURA]
Sparkly!

393
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,833
[MISAKI]
I'm always so busy, it's a
wonder I'm still awake, huh?

394
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,969
[USUI]
Maybe it'd be best if Kanou
hypnotized you again.

395
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,771
[USUI]
This guy hasn't slept
for nearly a month.

396
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,607
[KANOU]
Very perceptive of you.
Now then, here goes.

397
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,609
[MISAKI]
Hey now! Don't do it, Kanou!

398
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,745
[SUZUNA] Ta‐daa!
[MISAKI] Whoa, Suzuna!

399
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:07,480
[SUZUNA]
To get right to it, next time
will be a story about summer.

400
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:11,251
[SATSUKI]
Misa! We're going to the beach
with everyone from Maid Latte!

401
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,386
Does everyone have
their bikinis ready?

402
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,355
(MAIDS enthusiastically
answering)

403
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,158
[SATSUKI]
Usui, act as our
bodyguard, okay?
