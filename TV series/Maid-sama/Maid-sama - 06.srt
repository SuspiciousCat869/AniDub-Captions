1
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,462
[MISAKI]
Eh...

2
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:37,931
One day...

3
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,600
Please, Misa!

4
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,868
[MISAKI]
Completely out of the blue...

5
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,838
Please become our Master!

6
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,944
[MISAKI]
I acquired some disciples.
Total: five.

7
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,179
Eh...

8
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,589
Whoa...

9
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,192
What's that all about?

10
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,661
The Pied Piper?

11
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,196
That stupid look on
all their faces‐
first years...

12
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,965
Aah, what an honor!

13
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,267
Our Master is actually allowing
us to walk her home from school!

14
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:18,104
It's a good thing all five
of us Inuyama brothers
enrolled at Seika High School!

15
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,474
And what's even better is
now we're part of the
Ayuzawa Cram School!

16
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,544
Our dreams of the ultimate
high school experience...

17
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,211
...are finally coming true!

18
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,013
Uh, do you think you
could you stop with

19
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,583
the "Ayuzawa Cram School" stuff?
It's getting embarrassing.

20
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,653
But Master! What other name
could we possibly go by?

21
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,122
"Ayuzawa Association" and
"Ayuzawa Club" just don't
have the same ring to them!

22
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,759
Besides, this was the
only name all five of us
could all agree on!

23
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,193
They're so loud...

24
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,195
Fine, just do whatever you want.

25
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,930
Thank you very much, Master!

26
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,732
I think you guys
have the wrong idea.

27
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,801
If you want a good teacher,
you should go find
someone else to bother.

28
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,503
How could you say
such a thing?

29
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,237
There's no need to be
modest, Master!

30
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,574
We've been very impressed
with your lifestyle!

31
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,041
My lifestyle?

32
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,577
[INUYAMA]
At the school festival

33
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,378
we caught our first
glimpse of your passion!

34
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,747
Your drive to whip this school
into shape is unmatched!

35
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,449
No one escapes your wrath,
even senior students!

36
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,920
Plus, you're at the
top of your class,
both academics and P. E.!

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,223
And you singlehandedly govern
the entire student body!

38
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,225
See! You're the perfect
master for us!

39
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,160
No, I'm really not...

40
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,329
well, I guess when you
put it that way, I am kinda‐

41
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,566
(Inuyamas yelling)

42
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,905
No! Master, you represent
our goal in life!

43
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,908
We want to become just like
you in every single way!

44
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,543
Master, you're our idol!

45
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,444
Yeah, President
you're our Number One!

46
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,747
Long Live
Misaki Ayuzawa!

47
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,316
Yaaay!

48
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,253
Well, this is my stop.

49
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,656
Huh? But we heard that you
walk to school, Master.

50
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,157
What are you taking
the train for?

51
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,626
Oh, that's right!
We've heard the rumors.

52
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,294
You have a part‐time
job, don't you?

53
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,497
How honorable!
Our Master works endless hours

54
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,167
to singlehandedly support
her entire family!

55
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,102
Ooh! That's our Master for you,

56
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,271
truly an inspiration
to us all...

57
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,406
In that case, we must learn
by her example.

58
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,376
Please let us
accompany you!

59
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,878
I knew this would happen!

60
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,447
I'm sure the job is just
as extraordinary as you.

61
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,383
Uh, no, actually
it's very ordinary.

62
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,052
You'd just be bored
the whole time.

63
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,088
Not at all!
Just being able to sit
and watch you work

64
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,322
would be a
learning experience!

65
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,958
We wanna come, too!

66
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,793
No, no, that's okay!

67
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,629
Just go home and, uh,
do your homework or
something, okay, got it?

68
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,098
You heard the lady‐
she said "no."

69
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,733
Yeah, so hurry up
and scram.

70
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,701
Got it, dude‐bros?

71
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,269
Uh yeah we got it.

72
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,805
Well then, Master,
see you tomorrow.

73
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,006
See you tomorrow, Ma'am.

74
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,240
Yup.

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,810
I'm saved.

76
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,311
Well, see you at school.

77
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,346
We'll come with you
to the cafe!

78
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,348
After all, we have more
points to collect!

79
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,951
We hafta collect'em all‐
it's our duty, I'm tellin' ya!

80
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,187
Hey!

81
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,689
Then we're coming, too!

82
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,723
Yeah!

83
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,693
I already told you
"no," didn't I?!

84
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,564
Wait for us, Master!

85
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,140
Master!

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,843
I've gotta lose them somehow!

87
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,311
Ah!

88
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,714
Master! Master!

89
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,053
Did I interrupt
your game of tag?

90
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,154
Usui!

91
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,288
Master!

92
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,557
Master!

93
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,025
Where'd she run off to?

94
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,160
That's our Master!
Giving us the slip so easily!

95
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,429
(Sigh)
Saved again.

96
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,298
When did you suddenly get
so popular, Miss President?

97
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,334
No idea.

98
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,436
But it looks they want
to see me at my job.

99
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,071
Sure enough, she's super fast.

100
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,072
Sure enough!

101
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,607
Yes. Sure enough!

102
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,777
"Sure enough" you can't
let them find out, right?

103
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,383
By the way, I've
accumulated my points.

104
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,218
Huh? You got them already?

105
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,353
Is that good?

106
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,721
You stop by way too often!

107
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,523
But how else would I
get all my points?

108
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,925
Let's take a photo
together as my reward.

109
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,027
(Sigh)

110
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,235
Come on, Misa, you look
like you're in pain.

111
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,105
Just try and smile
like you normally do‐
act natural, okay?

112
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,874
Uh, sorry I just...

113
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,377
Master, we could take
one more picture
if you'd like.

114
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,079
Or would you prefer
to keep this one?

115
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,747
This one's perfect.

116
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,316
After all, Misa's at her
best when she's herself.

117
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,185
Aww!

118
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,353
Oh, Misa, aren't you
a lucky girl!
(Misaki crying)

119
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:31,191
It's a maid's greatest
honor to be so loved
by her Master!

120
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,793
Yay, yay!
Must be nice.

121
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,928
Is something the matter, Misa?

122
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,064
(Misaki crying)

123
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,635
(Students chatter)

124
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,272
Master! Good morning!

125
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,374
Uh... good morning.

126
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,012
Today we will do our best!

127
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,715
Mh...

128
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,084
(School bell)

129
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,787
Master!

130
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,723
Do you have anything new and
exciting to teach us today?!

131
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,259
Uh, sorry. I don't really have
anything interesting...

132
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,528
Well, it can't be helped.

133
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,328
Can't be helped.

134
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,195
Can't be.

135
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,096
Oh, man.

136
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,469
Huh? What're you doing?!

137
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,872
Job well done, Master!

138
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:20,874
Staaare!

139
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:21,575
Staaaare!

140
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,509
Staaaaare!

141
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,376
Staaaaaare!

142
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,210
Staaaaaaare!

143
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,979
STARE!

144
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,849
A simple meal of basic
ingredients‐ a winner's lunch!

145
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,284
Tomorrow, I'm going
to bring the exact
same thing!

146
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,787
(Sigh)

147
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,156
Aren't you going to eat?

148
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,924
Are you all right, Master?!

149
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,761
(Exhausted sigh)

150
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,630
President! There's an article
in the school newspaper...

151
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,198
Right. Let me take a look.

152
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,834
About the zone
allocation for
the cleaning project...

153
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,270
Yes. I'll make a
decision today.

154
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,873
Miss President, all these
were in the Complaints Box.

155
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,041
All right.
At tomorrow's meeting, I'll...

156
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:59,079
Staaare...

157
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,716
So that's the infamous
Ayuzawa Cram School.

158
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,450
Their dedication's
kinda scary.

159
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,886
That's enough!

160
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,788
If you've got that much
free time on your hands,

161
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,190
then use some of these
empty desks and study instead!

162
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,658
Yes, Ma'am!

163
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,097
They actually did
what she said...

164
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,933
Guess that's why they're
called the "Cram School"...

165
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,975
Wow, what a great
idea, Master!

166
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,444
Miss President, do you have
to work today, too?

167
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,813
Can we come with you‐?

168
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,747
Later!

169
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,748
Oh!

170
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,016
Be careful on your
way home, okay?

171
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,785
Wait, Master!
Why can't we come, too?!

172
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,554
No running
in the hallways!

173
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,523
Master, wait for us!

174
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,292
Ah!

175
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,194
Masteeeeeer!

176
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,433
They look like
a handful.

177
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,835
You again?!

178
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,236
Why don't you just tell
them to leave you alone?

179
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,804
Huh?

180
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,373
If you hate them, just tell
them to quit bothering you.

181
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,008
Actually, the truth is,

182
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,511
having them around
makes me kinda happy...

183
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,680
Ah! Master!

184
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,550
They may be a handful,
but they're dedicated.

185
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,985
I actually like them
quite a bit.

186
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,220
Hm.

187
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,196
Welcome to Maid Latte, Master.

188
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,966
Master!

189
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,234
There.

190
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,436
Would you like to try one of
today's specials, Master?

191
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,505
Or some tea or coffee?

192
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,173
[USUI]
And then.

193
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,175
Master! Wait for us!

194
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,079
Is today the day you'll finally
let us accompany you to work?!

195
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,819
(Heavy breathing)

196
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,688
That was a close one.

197
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,023
Y'know, your timing has
been way too good lately!

198
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,758
Why don't you just tell them?

199
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,193
Wouldn't they understand
if you just explained

200
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,495
the situation
to them properly?

201
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,697
Yeah, but even so...

202
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,532
I'm still a MAID.

203
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,002
It's not exactly
something to be proud of.

204
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:08,509
I mean, especially since
I'm their inspiration as
student council president.

205
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,010
They really look up to me!

206
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,012
I don't want to disappoint them.

207
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,049
So then you're just
going to keep running away
from them like this?

208
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,926
Running away?

209
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,079
Today's featured special
is pancakes with a
side of pure maple syrup.

210
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,214
Please relax and enjoy
your meal, mistress.

211
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,552
Master... what would you like me
to write on top for you?

212
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,687
C‐could you write "Love"?

213
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,689
Your wish is my command.

214
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,363
There. Please enjoy.

215
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:07,801
There's no way in hell I could
let those Ayuzawa Cram School
guys see me like this.

216
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,071
Please let me know if you
need anything else, okay?

217
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,576
Does Misa seem kinda
down to you or what?

218
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,645
Yeah, I wonder if
something happened?

219
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,146
[SATSUKI]
Oh, Misa...
Yeah?

220
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,915
These Masters would like to
challenge you to a game!

221
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,718
They're hoping to win
a photo with you, too!

222
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,788
All right, so you'd like
to go with a card game.

223
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,090
What would you like to play?

224
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,025
Speed, of course.

225
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,661
Don't go showin' off
too much now, Shiroyan.

226
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,096
A picture with Misa,
I can't wait!

227
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,365
Understood.
Let's begin...

228
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,835
You've got this
in the bag!

229
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,537
Remember how much
we've practiced!

230
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,772
Yeah.

231
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,208
Today is the day where
my blood, sweat, and tears

232
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,710
shall finally pay off!

233
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,677
Take her down!

234
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,312
Do your best, Shiroyan!

235
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,082
Here I go.

236
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,518
Kay!

237
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,119
One, two, three!

238
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,494
(Winner bell)

239
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:10,631
Huuuh?

240
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,798
So fast!

241
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,333
No way!
Is that even possible?!

242
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,503
(Giggles)
That's Misa for you‐
she shows no mercy!

243
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,640
That's why everyone calls her
the ultimate warrior.

244
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,374
She's completely
ruthless.

245
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,710
[MISAKI]
Of course.
If my picture got taken,

246
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,979
it could end up anywhere,
even at school.

247
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,917
Aah, dammit! I thought if
Usui could beat her then
there was no way we'd lose!

248
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,287
He's the first and only person
to have ever beaten her.

249
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,190
It was really incredible!

250
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,593
[SHIROKAWA]
The God of Maids
has abandoned us!

251
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,128
(Winner bell)

252
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,930
[MISAKI]
He beat me, but...

253
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,468
This is my first picture
with you, isn't it?

254
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,637
What did he do
with that picture?

255
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:54,007
Don't tell me he
took it to school!

256
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:59,445
So then you're just
going to keep running away
from them like this?

257
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,715
That's not it...

258
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:06,019
I'm not trying to run away.
I just don't want to
let them down...

259
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,390
If I think about it,
those guys used to
really hate me...

260
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,295
For the last time,
take those earrings out now!

261
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:20,166
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be sure to take
them out later.

262
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,837
Then they found out I was a
maid, and turned into THIS...

263
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,573
Collect those points
and try again, okay?

264
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,108
Okay! We won't give up!

265
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,643
Next time we'll get
even more points.

266
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,178
And then we'll get our special
photo with Misa for sure!

267
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,514
Yeah!

268
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,516
(Giggling)

269
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,819
Bunny ears! Bunny ears!

270
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,353
Oh, Misa!

271
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,989
I was thinking about making
tomorrow Bunny Ears Day!

272
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,692
I'm Bunny‐Bunny Honoka,
hop, hop, hop !

273
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,160
Bunny‐bunny, hop!

274
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,429
Maybe we should try
nibbling on some carrots.

275
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,765
Subaru, I don't think
you need those whiskers.

276
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:56,402
Oh, no! I guess they
make me look too much
like a mouse after all...

277
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,371
There! Misa‐Hoppity!

278
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,074
Misa what...?
Hop‐pi‐ty?

279
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,144
That's right!
Very nice, very nice!

280
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,613
C'mon, try saying it:

281
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:07,981
"Bunny‐Bunny Misa!"

282
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,550
So then, like this?

283
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,519
Bunny‐Bunny Misa...

284
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,320
Why're you holding
your hands like that?

285
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,056
You look like a zombie,
Misa Hoppity!

286
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,924
A hoppity bunny's hands
should be ROUNDED!

287
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,760
Try and look a little
cuter, GOT IT?

288
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,295
Honoka Hoppity,
you're getting scary again.

289
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,065
(Sigh)
If those guys saw me like this,

290
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,068
they'd never call me
"Master" again.

291
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,805
Misaki! What day is tomorrow?

292
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,675
Huh? Tomorrow? Hmm...

293
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,442
Is something going on?

294
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,478
If you don't know the answer,
it's all right.

295
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,082
As far as unimportant things go,
it's pretty unimportant.

296
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,752
Huh? What does that mean?

297
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,623
Tomorrow is Double‐Point Day
at the 3rd Street Drug Store.

298
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,192
DOUBLE points.
Can you believe it?

299
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:52,993
Yeah...

300
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,528
So if you need anything,

301
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,598
make sure to take this card
to 3rd Street store with you.

302
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:01,001
Uh... okay, sure.

303
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,603
Are you all right?

304
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:07,207
Uh, I might need some shampoo,
or detergent maybe...

305
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,242
No, I meant
"Are you all right?"

306
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,679
as in, you seem like
you're worrying about
something in particular.

307
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,382
Who, me?
No, I'm fine, really!

308
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,684
Huh...

309
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,786
Actually, it's not
just tomorrow:

310
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,656
there are special deals
for every day of the week.
So you're just
gonna drop it?

311
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,925
I've got them
all marked.

312
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,460
Woah, Suzuna!

313
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,963
Don't the people
at the store freak
when they see that?

314
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,197
Not at all.

315
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,999
They all help me
to get even more points,

316
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,801
which is a huge help.

317
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,270
Wow... Hm.

318
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,506
That's what's good
about you, Suzuna.

319
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,908
Huh?

320
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,712
[MISAKI]
I hope you always stay the same,
and do things your own way.

321
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,215
But, as for me...

322
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,851
[BOY]
Nah, I'm being serious.

323
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,185
Really?

324
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,787
I swear, man, really!
I wouldn't lie!

325
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,255
Hey, you down there.

326
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,791
You can't sit in the stairs,
you're blocking the way.

327
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,660
Ugh, it's the
friggin' President.

328
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,394
Let's go.

329
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,734
[INUYAMAS]
Master!

330
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,469
One, two...

331
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,337
Good morning, Master!

332
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:18,879
Good morning.

333
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,916
Master! Would you teach us some
of your aikido moves today?

334
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,651
Yeah, yeah, show us something!

335
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,152
Okay.

336
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,027
Ah!

337
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,565
This arm‐bar throw
is called "shihonage."

338
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,102
In aikido, you do not fight
by launching offensive attacks.

339
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,337
Your opponent
attacks irrationally,

340
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,172
so we don't match
force with force:

341
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,909
Instead turn your opponent's
force against him.

342
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,443
What an informative
demonstration!

343
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,678
Outstanding, Master!

344
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:52,779
Outstanding.

345
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,414
Aaah, so outstanding!

346
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,682
I just really...

347
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,318
I don't want them to be
disappointed in me...

348
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,393
This wind is crazy strong!

349
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,631
What's up?
Strange to see you
here, Miss President.

350
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,198
Usui!

351
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,468
Need me to jump in and save you
from those guys again?

352
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,136
No.

353
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,403
I just...

354
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,073
I came to clear
my head a bit...

355
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,218
I'm thinking about...

356
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,588
telling them that
I work as a maid.

357
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,931
When I think of them discovering
my secret by accident,
it just feels wrong...

358
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,969
I think that being up front and
telling them the truth about me
is the right thing to do.

359
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,238
I think it would be closer
to their idea of who they
think I really am.

360
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,742
So... you're doing it
for THEM then?

361
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,980
You're not doing it
to protect yourself?

362
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,282
Uh...

363
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,686
(Sigh)

364
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,854
That's right.

365
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,923
When it comes down to it,
I'm afraid.

366
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,325
Afraid of them seeing me
in my maid outfit,

367
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,795
and of their idea of me
being destroyed...

368
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,898
Afraid of being
looked down on...

369
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,667
Disappointing someone who
has shown you kindness is...

370
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,636
is hard.

371
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,471
Well, I wouldn't
be disappointed.

372
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,808
No matter
what you did.

373
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,376
Usui‐

374
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,145
And here's the proof!

375
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,649
Ah! What are you doing
carrying that thing around for?!

376
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:36,683
It's my good luck charm.

377
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,651
Good luck for what?!

378
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,753
Uh... good luck in love.

379
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,523
Ugh! You sonofa‐!

380
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,157
(Smack)

381
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,536
It's about time for us
to head back to class.

382
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,937
Sure is!

383
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:00,173
Oh well. It's your own fault
for trying to take it from me.

384
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,643
But... you...!
Oh no! Th‐this is BAD!

385
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:06,446
What should I do? If they
see that... picture...!

386
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:09,883
Should I go get it?

387
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,184
But even if you do...

388
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,486
Those guys down there
will get to it first!

389
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,221
What do you think
you're doing?!

390
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,389
I said, What do you
think you're doing?!

391
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,891
That's the
quickest way.

392
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,259
Yeah, to an
early grave, stupid!

393
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,262
If you tell me to go
get it, I'll go get it.

394
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,964
What are you talking about?!

395
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,166
Why would you even
do something like that
in the first place, Usui?!

396
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,468
Why, you ask?

397
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,737
Because...

398
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,716
I love you, Ayuzawa.

399
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,789
(Gasp)

400
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,528
Usuiiiiii!!

401
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,899
What is he doing?

402
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,236
What is he doing?

403
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,508
What is he doing?

404
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,812
What is he doing?!

405
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,470
I know, I rock.

406
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,809
Yeah, you do... you rock.

407
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,146
You big idiot.

408
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,815
Master!
Is everything all right?

409
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,150
Whoa! Mister Usui!

410
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,585
Hurry, a hospital‐!

411
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,587
It's not really
that big of a deal.

412
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,922
You can't just leap off
a building like that
and shrug it off!

413
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,158
Will someone tell us
what on Earth is going on?

414
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,459
Don't get it.
Just don't get it.

415
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,961
Yeah, what's going on?

416
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,469
There's something...
something I haven't told you.

417
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,739
Huh?

418
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,908
The truth is,
my part‐time job is‐!

419
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,442
[USUI]
Miss President.

420
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:24,718
You mean how every day
after school, I pay for
your services, right?

421
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,319
Wha‐?!

422
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,991
As my reward, let's keep it a
secret, okay, Miss President?

423
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,225
I...

424
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:35,996
I hate you so much!

425
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,334
[INUYAMA]
So Master is
Mister Usui's bodyguard?!

426
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,536
That's so cool!

427
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,670
That's our Master for you!

428
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,238
If she's busy protecting him,

429
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,173
then we'd just be
in the way, huh?

430
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,876
Who is Mister Usui exactly?

431
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,918
I wouldn't want anyone
else getting in on
my favorite pastime.

432
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,620
Huh?

433
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,389
I can't have "Misa" getting any
more fans than she already has.

434
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,226
Wanna take care of me
in your maid outfit?

435
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,994
Gah!

436
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,030
I'm leaving!

437
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:19,773
He's just a pervert!
A perverted alien freak!

438
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:54,234
[MISAKI]
I wonder if that fool Usui
is taking things easy
in the hospital...

439
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:55,569
[INUYAMAS]
Master!

440
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,137
Ah! You guys scared me!

441
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:59,540
Please, give your Ayuzawa
Cram School an order!

442
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,077
Huh?! Uh, homework!
How about writing a report on
everything that happened today?

443
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,445
And what about the writing?

444
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,280
Is five centimeters per
paragraph all right?

445
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,615
Uh, yeah, that's fine.

446
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,350
Okay then, goodbye!
See you tomorrow!

447
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,785
They really are nice guys...

448
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,555
Huh? Some trouble with the
students of Miyabigaoka?!

449
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:15,656
Well, that's bad!

450
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:16,890
A message from Usui:

451
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,759
"The next one is Girls
with Glasses Day."

452
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,893
Huh?!
