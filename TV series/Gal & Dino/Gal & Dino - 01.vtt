Like, does it even
know how scarves work?

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you look great!

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
Take good care of that.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU chuckles]
Hold up, it's all messy.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
Let's just straighten it out,
there we go, fixed it.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
Just like that.

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
Lookin' good, lookin' good!

[MIEHARU laughs]

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
You shook it loose!

Aw! Ha, ha. It's perfect!

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
I think red's your color.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
Mieharu, you there?
I've got this ozoni mochi soup.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
Want some?

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
Mieharu!

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
Mieharu?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
Oh, the door's unlocked.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm coming in!

Mieharu!

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
Anyone home? I've got
some extra soup here.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
It's not New Years yet,
but I had a craving.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
I made too much.
May I leave some?

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU]
Now it's your turn.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.264 position:50% align:center
This way!

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
Oh! You got me!

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
Okay, look this way!

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
Nice. Now.

Oh! You're good!

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU laughs]
Now look this way!

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
Don't mind me. I'll leave
the soup right here.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
One, two. Thanks for the--

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
Is cake, like, safe for you?

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU]
Mm. Just checkin'.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center

[MIEHARU]
Mm! Nice.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
Oh man. My stomach,
really, really hurts.

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU]
Oh, man.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's bad.

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
This really... Oh...

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is the worst.

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
Another failure.
