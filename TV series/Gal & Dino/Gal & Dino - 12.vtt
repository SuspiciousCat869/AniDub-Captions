00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
I guess you're right. Uh, yeah.

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
And I'd planned to.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
But instead,
I thought I'd ask it.

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
"Hey, friend. Why would you
need me to call this person?"

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
And it said, it just
wanted you to be here too.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
Heh. And since you were
already on your way,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
I figured "Eh, it's fine."

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
So that's how it went.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
Jeez. I'm sorry.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
I guess I still should've
given you another call.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.660 position:50% align:center
That was my bad.

00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
But still, I just
can't believe Dino

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
would ask a driver
for help like that.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Huh? Where did
Dino even get this scarf?

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU chuckles]
Well, it's mine.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Oh! Sorry, I didn't know.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Thanks very much!
Here, have it back.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
So, I should probably
try to go talk to it now.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
Thanks for taking care of Dino.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
I owe you one!

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]
What's wrong with me?

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
Why am I crying?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU]
Winter is coming.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling
it'll be a cold one.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
You'll catch a cold.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE sighs]

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
The driver told me everything.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
It was wrong of me to yell at
you without letting you talk.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I was just
kinda floored that you

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
actually had him call me.

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
Well, either way,
I'm at the beach.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
Guess it worked out!

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] But I thought you
didn't like the ocean, Dino!

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
I guess even
dinosaurs can grow.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
No, like, I mean you can
become more mature, right?

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
And I guess that means I'm
getting more mature, too.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You still totally don't get it.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
Man, hanging with
you is never boring.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
It's something new every time.

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I mean, like, it can
be annoying sometimes,

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
but it's still
always fun, you know?

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
This is so chill.

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:02.989 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE yelps]
Oh crap! I got work!

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
Like, soon!

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
Crap, crap, crap!

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
C'mon, let's go!

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
