Whoa! Ah!

[KAEDE] Oh my gosh,
oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Woo!

00:18:54.968 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]
Dino? You like it?

Woo...! Dino!

[NAOKO laughs]
That is so true.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
Dude, for real, that fight
scene was so friggin' sick!

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
My heart was pounding like
crazy, but it was awesome.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
Hey, do something funny, Dino.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]
What the crap! I can't.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO]
Do another, do another.

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO] Why are these so weird?
Pick normal ones!

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
I am actually dead now.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]
What the heck?

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
Literally, what am I looking at?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Literally, what were
you looking at?

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
More than you may have realized.

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
Look again and see
if you notice it.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO] Dude, for real,
that fight scene was--

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Take one more look.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO]
Dude, for real,

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
that fight scene was
so friggin' sick!

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Did you see it?

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
Look in the mirror
behind the actress.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
Notice the ghost of Dino,

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
wearing a costume from the
movie "Yatsuhaka-mura".

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
It appears again when

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.003 position:50% align:center
Dino is playing with
its backgrounds.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
This time in the top left
corner of the screen.

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
The ghost of Dino is now
taking a leisurely swim,

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
once again in a costume from
the movie "Yatsuhaka-mura".

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
In this clip, you can clearly
see the ghost of Dino,

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
on the right side of
the screen, again in costume.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
And finally, we see
the ghost of a panda,

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.606 position:50% align:center
which seems to have no intention
of hiding its presence from us.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
You may not believe it,

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
but you've seen it
with your own eyes.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Man, what a great day that was.

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
I love the amusement park.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Uh! How are we gonna
get home now, though?

What a cute panda!

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yay!
