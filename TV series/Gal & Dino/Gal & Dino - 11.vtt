No way.

What's wrong?

Hey, have you seen
my phone anywhere?

Crap, it's not in my bag!

This sucks.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.335 position:50% align:center
Did it fall out somewhere?

Hopefully I just left it
behind at my apartment!

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.049 position:50% align:center
Do you want me to try giving
it a call real quick?

Huh? But how?

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
[SHOUTA] Oh, man, Kaede,
I'm so glad you picked up.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
I was pretty sure you'd
still be at work.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
[SHOUTA] So, hey, I've been
feelin' a little bit lonely.

Would it be cool
if I came over?

Later.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center

U-Um, excuse me!
I don't mean to trouble you,

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.875 position:50% align:center

looking for this phone.

Hm?

Hey, Dino!

Did I just hear you
eating one of my chips?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
And now you're touching my phone

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
with your greasy chip hands.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
You get chip grease on my
screen and you're extinct.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] But at least
I know it's at home!

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
I was worried I'd
dropped it somewhere.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
I was totally freaking out.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
Was it just sitting
on the table?

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
All good then.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
Oh hey, could you go ahead and
put it on the charger for me?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
Plugged in by the bed?

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
You know.

Thanks!

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna grab some dinner
for us when I head out.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
I should be around
seven-ish probably.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, while you're here.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
I can't remember if
we have any beer.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Could you check
the fridge for me?

That's better than what
they've been paying me

Seriously. Come here a sec.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
Dino, look at how much
we've been spending

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
on power and water.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
Our bills are crazy high,

For real.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
You gotta slow down on the
water and electricity and gas.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
Got that?

You keep wasting stuff like that

and I'm gonna make you start
helping out with the bills.

I mean you kinda have a job

pays you pretty well.

[KAEDE] Mm? No, it's cool,
you don't really have to pay.

H-Huh?

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] If we go fifty-fifty,
it's 3,000 apiece,

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
plus two is five 5,000.

Having fun?

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Uh-oh.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggling]
Whoa! Ah!

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Oh my gosh,
oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE laughs]

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Woo!

00:18:54.968 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]
Dino? You like it?

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
[giggling continues]

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:09.232 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Ooo! Bye! Woo!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
This is awesome! Woo!

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Woo! This is fun! Hey, Dino!

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.371 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yay!

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yay!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE yelps]
Woo...! Dino!

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]
That is so true.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
Dude, for real, that fight
scene was so friggin' sick!

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
My heart was pounding like
crazy, but it was awesome.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
Hey, do something funny, Dino.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]
What the crap! I can't.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO]
Do another, do another.

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO] Why are these so weird?
Pick normal ones!

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
I am actually dead now.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO laughs]
What the heck?

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
Literally, what am I looking at?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Literally, what were
you looking at?

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
More than you may have realized.

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
Look again and see
if you notice it.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO] Dude, for real,
that fight scene was--

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Take one more look.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
[NAOKO]
Dude, for real,

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
that fight scene was
so friggin' sick!

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Did you see it?

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
Look in the mirror
behind the actress.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
Notice the ghost of Dino,

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
wearing a costume from the
movie "Yatsuhaka-mura".

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
It appears again when

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.003 position:50% align:center
Dino is playing with
its backgrounds.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
This time in the top left
corner of the screen.

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
The ghost of Dino is now
taking a leisurely swim,

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
once again in a costume from
the movie "Yatsuhaka-mura".

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
In this clip, you can clearly
see the ghost of Dino,

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
on the right side of
the screen, again in costume.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
And finally, we see
the ghost of a panda,

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.606 position:50% align:center
which seems to have no intention
of hiding its presence from us.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
You may not believe it,

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
but you've seen it
with your own eyes.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Man, what a great day that was.

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
I love the amusement park.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Uh! How are we gonna
get home now, though?

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
[PANDA squeaks]

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE gasps]
What a cute panda!

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Yay!

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
