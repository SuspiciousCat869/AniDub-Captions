[ZAKOSHI whimpers]

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
I can barely keep my eyes open!

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
Time for some magic!

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
Chongeh, chongeh,
chongeh, chongeh.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
Chongeh, chongeh,
chongeh, chongeh.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
I'm Mister Magic!

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
Hey yo.
I'm Hollywood Zakoshisho.

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.104 position:50% align:center
So, right.

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
Uh, You're watching Gal and
Dino, which personally I think

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
it's a really fun little
manga, you know?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
And basically it's like, uh,

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
they just put a <i>gyaru</i>
and a dinosaur together.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
Like it combines two
elements that seem like

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
they shouldn't work, right...?

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hm?

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:08.421 position:50% align:center
[ZAKOSHI mumbling]

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
[ZAKOSHI]
Right, right, right, right?

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hm? Hm?

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
[mumbling]

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
But it turns out they actually
work really well together,

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
and, like, there's this,

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
you know, this weird kinda
chemistry or whatever, right?

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
It's pretty fun.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
'Cause to me--

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
I think of <i>gyarus</i> as
sorta, like, being like...

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
You see them in Harajuku
suckin' on a boba tea, right?

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
That's what I think of anyway,
but this manga totally makes

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
the pairing work you know,

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
a girl like that plus
a dinosaur, right?

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
You're gonna like it a lot.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
Yeah, or I guess
maybe you won't!

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
Whatevs, later.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
[ZAKOSHI making sucking sound]

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[sucking sound continue]

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
Now don't forget.
This guy, Satoru Sayama,

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
you better believe
he's tough as hell!

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
And he's weird as hell!

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
And plus, friggin' scary!

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
Get me?

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I'm back!

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[ZAKOSHI]
Whoa, what's this about?

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Why's it gotta be
so cold out there, though?

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on?
Hey! What's this?

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
[ZAKOSHI]
Wait!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Dude, I am dead.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
A shower sounds good A.F.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Huh? What are
you doing, what is this?

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
What the hell, dude?

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
Just lemme shower and go to bed!

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
Get outta the way!

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE hums]

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
All right.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I think I've
seen that guy before.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
Meh, whatevs.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Hey, stop letting
randos in here.

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE grunts]

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Whoa, what is that?
Yo, that hat is legit!

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:01.738 position:50% align:center
Can I see it?

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
C'mon, give it here!

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE grunts]
Lemme see it for a sec!

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.042 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Don't be a jerk.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:17.462 position:50% align:center
I only wanna look at it for
a second, c'mon, Dino.

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:21.174 position:50% align:center
Let's play together again soon!

00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:24.469 position:50% align:center
In the real world next time,
not dreamland.
