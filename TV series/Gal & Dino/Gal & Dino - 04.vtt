So, right.

Uh, You're watching Gal and
Dino, which personally I think

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
it's a really fun little
manga, you know?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
And basically it's like, uh,

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:54.908 position:50% align:center
they just put a <i>gyaru</i>
and a dinosaur together.

work really well together,

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
and, like, there's this,

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
you know, this weird kinda
chemistry or whatever, right?

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center

suckin' on a boba tea, right?
