Hey, what's that pose for, dork?

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] This park is
seriously huge, though.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
The one over by my apartment
is nowhere near this big.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Whoa!

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Holy crap, is that
the freaking ocean?

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I haven't been
to the ocean in forever!

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Even just getting to see
it gets me super psyched!

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
You ever seen the ocean, Dino?

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
Are you having flashbacks
to that shark movie?

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
The water here is way
too shallow for sharks.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.540 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it'll be fun!

00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
No, for real, you're good!

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE grunts]

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
It's fine, just go!

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
Well, it's so nice out here,

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
we can at least get
a selfie, right?

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
Say cheese!

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggling]
Watch it!

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
But for real, though,
we're not up that high.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
What's that face mean?

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
Ugh! I'm tired!

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
Oh right, I totally forgot
to post our selfie on Insta.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
'Kay, there we go.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hey, where's the dino?

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that!

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Underhand?
Oh my gosh it's a dinosaur!

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
Dino, do you know how
to play baseball?

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
Take the bat and give it
some practice swings!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Whoa, awesome!

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
Man, where'd that
dinosaur run off to?

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Whoa!

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
Wow, Dino's a natural.

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
Lemme give you this as
thanks for playing with us.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
'Kay, wanna head back?

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] How 'bout we pick up
something to eat and go home?

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
What sounds good to you?

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
You want fish? Okay!

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
Ameyoko Market's
great for seafood.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
Hey look, there's a
fish stand right here.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
Dang, we gotta lot of options.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
'Scuse me sir,

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
can you tell me
what's good today?

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
I've got some
excellent cod here.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Cod, huh?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Dino?

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah?

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]
Go with cod?

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
Lemme think.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
--[KAEDE] We'll take the cod.
--[SHOPKEEP A] Got it.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Two? One apiece,
sound good? Cool.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
--[SHOPKEEP A] Here.
--[KAEDE] Thanks so much!

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]
Yay!

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
Got fish!

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
Okay, so you're cool with fish,

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
but just not sharks,
is that right?

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]
You're such a dork.

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hm?

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
What, you wanna stop in here?

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Did we just walk into
the Manly Man Shop for Men?

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You see anything you want?

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
That one?

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if a cowboy hat
would really suit you, though.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Hey, try this five-panel here.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yeah, that's so you.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! You're rocking it.
The print is fly, seriously!

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggling]
Yeah! It looks great.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE sighs]
That was a fun day.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
I'm tired.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
You know, I still don't
know what I'm actually

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
supposed to feed you, Dino.

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggles]

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
Is that a new keychain?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.325 position:50% align:center
Yo, where'd you get a keychain
that looks like you, huh?

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:08.078 position:50% align:center
No fair, I want
my own merch too!

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:13.124 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE whines]
And plus, it's like super cute!

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
Man, when do I get a keychain?

00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
Hey, no dancing!
Stop rubbing it in!

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.633 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Jeez!
