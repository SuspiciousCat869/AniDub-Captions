[KAEDE] This park is
seriously huge, though.

The one over by my apartment
is nowhere near this big.

Whoa!

[KAEDE] Holy crap, is that
the freaking ocean?

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I haven't been
to the ocean in forever!

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Even just getting to see
it gets me super psyched!

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
You ever seen the ocean, Dino?

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
Are you having flashbacks
to that shark movie?

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
The water here is way
too shallow for sharks.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.540 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it'll be fun!

00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
No, for real, you're good!

Well, it's so nice out here,

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
we can at least get
a selfie, right?

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
Say cheese!

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE giggling]
Watch it!

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
But for real, though,
we're not up that high.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
What's that face mean?

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
Ugh! I'm tired!

Sorry about that!

Whoa! Underhand?
Oh my gosh it's a dinosaur!

Dino, do you know how
to play baseball?

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
Take the bat and give it
some practice swings!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Whoa, awesome!

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
Man, where'd that
dinosaur run off to?

something to eat and go home?

What sounds good to you?

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
You want fish? Okay!

I've got some
excellent cod here.

Cod, huh?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Dino?

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

Okay, so you're cool with fish,

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
but just not sharks,
is that right?

That one?
