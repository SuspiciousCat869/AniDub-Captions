Whoa. That's a legit dinosaur.

But I thought dinosaurs
were normally, like,

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
way, way bigger than that.

--Huh? But this thing's huge.
--[YAMADA] Eh...

It barely fits
in my apartment.

Yeah, I guess.
What do you feed it?

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.047 position:50% align:center
Ramen.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
Oh, for real? Yeah, so like,
what is it watching?

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
It kinda looks like
a rerun of "Partners."

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
Shut up. Is it cool
to post this?

Hey, Dino! Do you
wanna be on Insta?

So, our inside man

Oh, jeez.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
Oh, man.

[MIEHARU groans]

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center

[MIEHARU]
Ow. It hurts...

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
Nothing is impossible for me!

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
So, this is Christmas, huh?

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
[SHOUTA AOI]
It's not your fault.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I can't allow
the two of you to meet.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
Edo Soba. Let's do this!

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that looks good!

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
Edo Soba, sorry, but you
better wait your turn.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
Here we go, let's eat!

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
My work here is done.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
[MIEHARU]
Whoa. My stomach.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
It hurts, like, really bad.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, ow...

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
But how? I'm positive
I changed the future!

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
This sucks...

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
Mieharu, are you okay?

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me?
Mieharu, please answer me!

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
You're in quite a predicament.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
And so are you...

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
How can you see me?

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
Impossible... There's another?

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
Gross, what the eff, man?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
