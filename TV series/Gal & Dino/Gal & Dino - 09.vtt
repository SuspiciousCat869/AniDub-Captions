hang out off the clock

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
is a completely different thing!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
I should wait.

But not to worry.

Really, guys?

Let's review the facts.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
The front door and the
windows are all locked.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
So we're looking at a
classic locked-room mystery.

Clearly the only people in
this room are the four of us.

It's not, like, a huge deal.

Uh! Look, we have a whole
pot of oden back here

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
and there are literally
buttloads of eggs.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
We got more! See, come here.

They're all... All of my--

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Now all the eggs
over here are gone, too!

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
What the heck is
the deal with this?

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
[NAENANO] Things just
keep getting stranger

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
and stranger.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Why would anybody wanna
steal a bunch of oden eggs?

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
[NAENANO] Have you spotted
anything, Detective?

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Okay, this is seriously weird,

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
but we don't need to make
a big deal out of it.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.010 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I can share my eggs, guys!

They're all gone.

We're going to catch this egg
thief before he strikes again.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
I guarantee it.

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Detective?

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
Okay, but we've still
got a table full of food,

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
so what's the big deal?

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
We can't look the other
way on this, Kaede.

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
There's a thief in this room
and we need to figure out

who they are.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
You'd have to be a
pretty bold criminal

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
to pull of an egg heist during a
party inside a locked room,

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
and every person here is
dedicated to bringing our thief
