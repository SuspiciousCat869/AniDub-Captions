00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] If only I had
been more thoughtful

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.521 position:50% align:center
and conscious of her feelings
instead of my own,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
I would've have noticed
sooner she was ill.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:52.946 position:50% align:center
For me, that is my single
biggest regret in life.

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.659 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Everyone's done, then.

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.620 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Banri. Go ahead
and call everyone back in.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
Sure thing, Director,
as you wish.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.045 position:50% align:center
There's a considerable
difference in skill.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
Good thing we checked in on
their progress ahead of time.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
That's an understatement.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.094 position:50% align:center
Now I see why assigning this
exercise was so important.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
Do you? All right.

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:19.889 position:50% align:center
Now we figure out
how to coach 'em.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center
Give it all you've got.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.063 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] So, here are
the current standings.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
At the top is in terms
of execution...

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.780 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Is Juza.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.077 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] It's tight, but the
runners-up are Sakyo,

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center
and following
closely behind, Omi.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.166 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
Taichi's in fourth place.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
Give some thought to how you can
reveal more of who you are.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
That's the reason
you were ranked

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.424 position:50% align:center
lower than the other three.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
You're sayin' I'm last.
Is that some kinda joke?

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
Heh. Believe me,
I wish it were a joke.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] I mean, it's gotta be.
Who'd lose to him?

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Your portrait was fake.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
Banri, you made the whole
thing up, didn't you?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
So, I wasn't the only
one who realized.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
How would you know?!
Are you reading my mind?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
Yours felt the most
superficial by a wide margin.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
That's funny. It's my life.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
Who are you to judge whether
or not it's entertaining?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
The composition made sense
as a narrative, didn't it?

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
Even so, Juza and the rest
of the troupe's portraits

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
were far superior.
In all aspects.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
Maybe you guys just suck at
judging, ever thought of that?

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
Bring in an audience!

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
They'd pick me over
this loser any day!

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
Ha. It's true I'm not gonna be
judgin' the actual performances.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
And yet, I know
one thing for sure.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
That is, Juza is gonna beat you.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Where're you...?

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Let him go.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
There's no convincing him till
he figures it out on his own.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
[JUZA exhales]

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
[growls, gasps]

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
Aw, dammit!

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Too many stupid mistakes.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
Another game!

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
Nah, I think I'm done
for the day.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're just
gonna keep on losing

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
if you push forward
without any real focus.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to do your
portrait tomorrow, right?

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you practice?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
What's the point?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
My acting's way better
than everyone else's.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
Talent aside, even I can tell
you're pretty nervous about it.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
Huh...? No, I'm not.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
Sure, whatever.
Shower time. Have fun.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
Yeah, catch ya later.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
See ya.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
Who's he calling nervous?
What a joke.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
This sucks.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Huh? What're you saying, Banny!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna ditch us!
You can't!

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
Besides, we haven't even
performed our soliloquys yet.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
Dude. There's no need
to be acting so rash.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Who's acting rashly?

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking about it

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
and I realized Hyodo's
no match for me.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
I don't need a survey
to tell me I've won.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
And since the
competition's over,

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
there's no reason
to stay any longer.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Come on. We five are a
team. One for all, all for one.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
You've already put so
much effort into the play.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
It'd be a waste.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
Look. Like I've already said,

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
I only agreed to join so I could
compete against Hyodo.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Then live your life.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
Go on, but don't you ever
show your face here again.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
How can you say that?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Tch. Yeah, no problem.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
I miss anything?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
You're just in time!

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
Talk some sense into him!
He'll listen to you, Juza!

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
Banri's decided he wants
to quit the troupe.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
Care to explain
yourself, Settsu?

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] I don't see what's so
confusing. Our match is settled.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
Listen, you're not leaving
right in the middle of--

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
You never stood a chance
from the start.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
It's useless staying.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
I haven't lost.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
And take my word,
I'm never gonna lose to you.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
Ha! Please.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
You've never had to sit
through your acting before.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
You're right.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
Think I don't know you're
a better performer than me?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
But there's not a chance in hell

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
your passion for
acting beats mine!

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
And I don't quit either.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
Whatever, ya ham. Later.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
He's really gone.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Let him leave, Hyodo.
The troupe will be

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
a whole lot better
off without him.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
Whatever, shut up. [laughs]

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
Tch. This really sucks.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Banri, wait!

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Director?

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Are you serious about quitting?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I am.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
Autumn Troupe, Mankai Company,
I'm done with it.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
Help me to understand why.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
What don't you get?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
I only joined the dumb
troupe to beat Hyodo.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
But I can trash
that fool any day,

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
so there's nothing
motivating me to stay.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
Well, see ya.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
Banri. Don't you wanna
find out for yourself.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
Whether or not you
actually beat him?

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
As if our rehearsals weren't
all the proof I needed.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
You opinion may change

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
after seeing his
portrait yourself.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
If you're so confident you've
got Juza beat without fail,

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
make sure then.
Watch his performance.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a waste of my time.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
If you leave now,
what's that going to say?

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
It'll look as though you don't
wanna face the results.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
Almost like you're running away.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
It's not like me being here is
gonna help improve their acting.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
It's starting.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
This is my portrait,
by Sakyo Furuichi.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
I turned my back on my
dreams a long time ago.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
That is without a doubt,
my biggest regret in this life.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.752 position:50% align:center
And the reason why,
in order get back

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
all the time I lost,
I live fearlessly.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
I consider it a matter
of honor repaying those

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
who believed in me,
who could see my potential.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
For them, I keep going.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
Since that day, I've been
my living life in his stead.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
And after some soul searching,

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
I decided to become an actor,
just like he dreamed of being.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
I hope somehow this'll help him.
Even if just a little.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
To rest in peace,
wherever he is.

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
Initially, this was his dream,
and not mine.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
But recently, someone helped me
realize that wasn't true.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
Performing on stage
is also my dream!

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
I wanna tell you about
when I was young

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center
and how the girl next door
was unlike any other person.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
We literally lived
right beside each other,

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
but I felt miles away from her.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
Not telling her how I felt
is my biggest regret.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] This is pretty
good for a pre-show!

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
I don't know who to vote for!

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
He's up next.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
This is my portrait.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
Juza Hyodo.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Ever since I was a kid,

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
I was always different
from others.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
A head taller than
everyone else my age.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
Not to mention a quiet kid.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
I didn't fit in with
my classmates,

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
and only my family
ever approached me.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
Wait! Let me play
with you, please!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't go!
I just wanted to be--

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
Part of the group. But try
as I might, it never happened.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Soon as they saw my face,
they would run away.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
If I was brave enough
to ask if I could join,

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
I would still be rejected.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
I had to accept this
was who I was.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
Nothing would change that.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
On the first day of school,

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
the way I looked
scared my classmates.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
I know the impression I give

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
with my impassive,
glaring eyes.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
Even my teachers
walked on eggshells

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
whenever they were around me.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
At that age, I wasn't
socially adept enough

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
to talk about my
appearance with others.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
How could I, when putting
myself out there

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
led to me getting hurt?

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
Everyone thought the best thing
was to keep their distance.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
Because they didn't
know how to handle me.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
Later on, distance wasn't
an issue and I found

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
more and more people
wanted a piece of me.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
The hell you lookin' at?

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
All I did was try to protect
myself. Before I knew it,

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
everyone had already labeled me
as the town delinquent.

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
I wasn't interested
in theater, at first.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
Until a cultural festival in my
first year of middle school.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
For me, school events
were torture.

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
But when my class
decided to put on a play,

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
suddenly, I had
an epiphany that struck me

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
like a bolt of lightning.
I saw freedom.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.182 position:50% align:center
I despised the person I was.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
But in a play, I could be
someone entirely different.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
There it was,
my ray of hope, at last!

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
Teacher!

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.905 position:50% align:center
Somehow, I found the courage
within me to volunteer.

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
My teacher called my name,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
and asked if I wanted
to be a stagehand.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
I don't blame them.

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they thought
they were doing me a favor.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
Since I didn't fit in.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
Then? Then I fell silent.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
I felt the class's
piercing stares

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
as they waited for my answer.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
After that, I quit
hoping to be an actor.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
All the while, each time
I watched a performance,

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
my longing for theater grew.

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
Then I heard the news.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
My cousin Muku had
joined an acting troupe.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
He was the most
timid person I knew,

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center
and would tense up as
soon as he was forced

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
to make eye contact.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
The thought of him acting in
front of a crowd was insane.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
But I was proven so wrong.

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
The moment I saw him perform,
it became clear to me.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
On stage, my cousin was
animated and had confidence.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
Almost like he was
a different person.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
I realized, all this time,
like me, he also wanted to

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
break out of his shell.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
We were more similar
than I thought.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
I was hit with a crushing sense
of admiration and envy.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
Why wasn't I there,
standing in his place?

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to be a
part of the audience,

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
merely looking on!

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
I thought of that day
in middle school.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
My hand was halfway up,
so why did I decide to lower it?

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
I've always been different from
the other kids around me.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
That's why... That's why...

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
Why I want to become
someone different!

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
My whole life I wanted to
become a different person!

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:55.210 position:50% align:center
And if Muku could do it,
I also had the power to.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
He showed me when you're on
stage, you can be someone else!

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
But I had to take the leap.
I knew joining a theater troupe

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
would be the last shot
at this new life.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
When auditions came up, I was
determined to impress them.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
Nothing would stop me!
I had to make it!

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth,

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
I still can't believe I
passed the first step.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
But here I am in front of you.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
And now that I've been given
the opportunity to perform,

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
I'm more determined
than ever to change.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
Because the fact is,
for a loner like me,

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
being on stage is my last hope.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] They already
tallied up the votes.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
I can tell you the results
if you'd like.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] It's okay. I think I
can guess. Hyodo won, right?

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
Director, I want to know what'll
it take for me to be better?

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Tell me, what should I do?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] First off, you need
to take acting seriously.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
And have the
determination to succeed.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
The good news, you've got
that second trait covered.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Watching Hyodo's portrait...

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
I can't really explain it,
but I felt so worked up.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
Like the same level
of excitement

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
when I picked a fight
with him and lost.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
I can't leave. I can't quit now!
It's not over yet!

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
Let's head back to the dorm.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
But the guys...

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'm sure the others will
understand if you explain

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
to them. Probably
even Sakyo, I hope.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hi, I'm home.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.824 position:50% align:center
And Banny's with you!

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
So, you're not
quitting after all?

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's up? Missed you.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
Care to explain
why you're back?

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn I told you

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
never to show
your face here again.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
He thought it over,
and he's gonna rejoin.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] You expect me to
trust him? He quit once,

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
what's stopping him
from doing it again?

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
I saw your portraits tonight.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
You beat me.
And I can admit that.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.732 position:50% align:center
Starting with auditions,

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
I thought I was way
better than all of you.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
But you grew as actors
and surpassed me.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
So, I panicked.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
I want another shot...
to be the best performer here.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
I'll take it seriously, I swear.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
So, please let me come back.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
Am I hallucinating?
Somebody pinch me.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
He's... apologizing.

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
You promise you'll
work twice as hard

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
and take on the responsibilities
of a leader from now on?

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Yes. I swear.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
And you're all right with
him rejoining, Hyodo?

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.689 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
Good, cause you and
I aren't through.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
I hope you're ready to lose
to me in every category.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
That includes your
passion for acting.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll see.

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
Oh! I know! Let's take a bath
together as a troupe!

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
Sorry, am I
misunderstanding you?

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Come on! Not like we
weren't gonna bathe anyway!

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
So, let's jump in together!

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
It's not the worst idea
I've ever heard.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
I mean, we have been staggering
our bath times until now.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows the best way
to make up is to hang out naked!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
Goodness, how did we
get to this point?

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I think it'll be good
for you! You should go, too!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Yes, that's easy for you to say.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Ah... This feels like
a special occasion,

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
getting everybody
together like this!

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
Sure, but even
you've gotta admit...

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
Four people in one
bath's a bit crowded.

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
Why do you think
we've been taking turns?

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
You're hogging most
of the space.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
We're the same size, genius!

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Most of Autumn Troupe
has large frames, except for me.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
I'm the puniest one.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they say I'm
even smaller than Yuki.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's not like
bigger's necessarily better.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI laughs]

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
It sure does help out
if you're in a fight.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
When you're huge, you get
in the way. Like Settsu, here.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
What'd I just tell ya?
We have the exact same bodies!

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Must you always shout?

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's not Sakyo, is it?

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
What the hell're you gawking at?

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
You call this proper
bath decorum?

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
No glasses. Weird.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Extremely.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Shut up and get out already.

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
There's absolutely no way

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
I'm getting in there
with the four of you.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Aw, why not?
This is team building!

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI sighs]

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Without his specs on,
he looks half his age.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
Plus, his clothes hide
how slender he is.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Like he's a completely
different person.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
That's funny.

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect nearly
this much talking.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[OMI] It's even more cramped
with all five of us.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
I will happily get out.

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, it's totally okay
every once in a while!

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Don't get too comfortable.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
This is hardly the time
to be relaxing.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
There are only a few rehearsals
until opening night.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
You worry too much.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
Says the person who's the source
of most of our issues.

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
You'd better take this
seriously from now on.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
I don't need reminding.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
We're going to make it
a huge success.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Of course, we are.

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
You've no choice, otherwise
this troupe is done for.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
[OMI] We've got to go all out
and do whatever it takes.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
If we fail, Spring and Summer
Troupes will resent us.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Exactly right.
So, let's get ready to work.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
[BANRI, JUZA]
We will.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
I'm not gonna lose.

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
This really sucks.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Stay away from me.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
What're you talking about?

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
You stay away from me!

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
No telling if your
poverty's contagious!

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
You made this mess.
How're you gonna fix it?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
Ain't like it's my
problem or anything.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
Not your problem?

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
As soon as they find out
the goods got stolen,

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
our heads are gonna roll!

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Wait, hold up.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:08.208 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
[JUZA grunting]

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
Bullshit, not your problem!
Soon as they find out the goods

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
got stolen, our heads
are gonna roll!

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Nice work.
I could tell a big difference

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
in your delivery
with that line read.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
The passion was there.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
You were watching us?

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Morning.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
You're both early.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Mornin', Director!

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Morning.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Look who beat us to rehearsal.

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
Maybe that group bath was
what they needed to start fresh.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Here's hoping this lasts.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Stop acting.
I can see that little grin.

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Surely you don't mean me.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
You're such a tsundere!

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
Who asked for your opinion?

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
Ever noticed how he's
so much meaner to me

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
than anyone else here?

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] There was more nuance
to my cruelty that time.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center
Pay attention.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
I learned something new!

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
Back to work. Can't let
either of 'em outshine us.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
You said it!

00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:43.613 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Everyone! I've great news!

00:22:43.655 --> 00:22:48.034 position:50% align:center
As of today, we completely
sold out every ticket!

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:51.413 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's amazing to hear!

00:22:51.454 --> 00:22:54.040 position:50% align:center
All of 'em? Really? Well,
that's certainly a relief.

00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:55.750 position:50% align:center
Only thing left for
us to go out there

00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:57.669 position:50% align:center
and make the performance
a success.

00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:59.129 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Give it everything.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.840 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Ticket sales reflect
audience interest.

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.758 position:50% align:center
It's clear that they'll
have high expectations

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.468 position:50% align:center
for us this season.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Nice.

00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:09.097 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Well, if we do
encounter any setbacks--

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:11.307 position:50% align:center
No sweat. I'll work 'em out.

00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:13.518 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] All right, guys. Let's
do one last start to finish

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.770 position:50% align:center
to prep for the dress
rehearsal tomorrow.

00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:16.938 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Director!

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.401 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, Yuki.
What's the matter?

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:24.529 position:50% align:center
Come and see, it's bad.

00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.288 position:50% align:center
I stopped in to make slight
adjustments to the costumes

00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:36.332 position:50% align:center
and found that someone
else beat me to it.

00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:39.085 position:50% align:center
It's unreal.
Who would do such a thing?

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.254 position:50% align:center
It's unforgivable!
