[BANRI sighs]

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
My name is Setsu Banri.
Here's my portrait.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.883 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Nobody's coming to try out.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.969 position:50% align:center
I scouted a couple
prospective members,

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
so hopefully someone comes.

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50% align:center
You already know them.
I'm not sure

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.141 position:50% align:center
you can say that's
a real casting call.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.268 position:50% align:center
I wonder if they're people
we happen to know, too.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
Some are! I have a feeling
that one of them

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50% align:center
might end up being a no-show.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
I just hope that they're
all triangle-tastic!

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
What's that even mean?

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
Guys with triangular faces
have three times the charm!

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.240 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.159 position:50% align:center
Hey, how are ya?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.660 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] I shoulda figured
you'd get scouted, Omimi!

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.289 position:50% align:center
Who's that?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
It's your first name,
Omi. With a twist!

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center
That's funny.
Thanks for the nickname?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
We're happy to have you.
Welcome!

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Thank you. Glad to be here.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.052 position:50% align:center
Yo my dudes! Sup!

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
Please, no.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.721 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
The name's Taichi Nanao.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
I've never done any
acting in my entire life.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
I'm only here 'cause
girls like that stuff!

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
Ha! I totally getcha!

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
'Sup, I'm Kazunari Miyoshi.
Nice to meet ya!

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
What up, bro!

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
Birds of a feather, am I right?

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
You're being a bit too generous
with your choice of animal.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
Between the two of them,

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
they have the grace and
intelligence of a mutt.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
That's not very nice, Yukki!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
You can stop staring.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Oh, sorry. So,
you're Yukki? Pretty name.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
So pleased to meet
your acquaintance, miss!

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
Hate to burst your bubble,

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
but the cutie you're
trying to hit on

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
is actually a grouchy guy
who likes to play dress-up.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.466 position:50% align:center
Grouchy? How rude.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] You can't be serious.
Are you telling me she's a bro?

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
No way, I was totally
ready to dive head-first

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
into one of those messy theater
situationships you hear about!

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You got your hopes up
for nothing.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Say, am I confused,
or have I met you somewhere?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Duh, we go to the same
high school, remember?

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
You're definitely no
stranger to me, Tenny.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
Guess that checks out.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
Thanks for coming.
Honestly, you're a lifesaver.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
It's my pleasure.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you hittin'
me up to begin with.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
Well, you did seem
kind of interested.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
You wanna step up to the
plate and try auditioning?

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
I sure do. I'm new, but...

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
...acting recently became
a big dream of mine.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
Became?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Hey.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Is he about to steal
our lunch money?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
Oh, cousin JuJu--

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
Shut it. I didn't come
here to make small talk!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
This where they're holding
interviews for new recruits?

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this is it.
You interested in signing up?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Yeah.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
Wonderful!

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Write down your name and the
reason you'd like to audition.

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Come now. A few more
steps through the door.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
No need to be shy!

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
I told you no thanks!

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
Good news, everyone!

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
I managed to wrangle some
fresh talent on the way over!

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
Look, I already said I wasn't
interested. So back off--

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
You snake.
The hell you doing here?

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
I was about to ask
you that. Moron!

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
--What's that?
--You heard!

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Listen boys,
why don't we calm down?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
They're a rowdy duo,
aren't they?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh, yea. Isn't that
Juza freakin' Hyodo?

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
A friend of yours?

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
He's a third year at our school!

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
No one's ever challenged him
to a fistfight without losing!

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
Whoa! I bet that's a guy
who likes triangles!

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
He's got an angular attitude!

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
You wanna piece of me?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Don't tempt me. If you
came for trouble, you should go!

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
You ain't the boss
of me, ya jerk!

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
'Kay that's it. You'd better
behave yourselves--

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
otherwise, neither of you
gets to audition!

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] You guys! This isn't
a staring contest, 'kay?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
A couple of delinquents.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
They're more alike
than they realize.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
I'm seeing it, too.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
Hey, boss-lady. When do we get
to show you what we're made of?

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
We're not quite ready yet,

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
but we'll be good
to go any minute.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
Quick question.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
But wasn't there supposed to
another person you invited.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
About that--

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Heh.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
You somehow managed to
scrape five people together.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey Sakyo!

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Not the repo man again.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
Hold on, for real though?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Just in time.
I'm so happy you made it!

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
Whoa, is this happening?

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
Did you ask him to join the
Autumn troupe, or am I crazy?

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
Not gonna lie,

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
this is shaping up to be
a rough-looking bunch.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
Hey. Is it me, or is
this group weird?

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
Well, people say you can't
judge a book by its cover.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
Let me reassure you. He might
be a little intimidating,

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
but Sakyo cares about
Mankai Company.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
He has this entire time.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
From what I've seen
the last few months,

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
nobody loves this troupe
more than he does. I promise.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
We couldn't do what
we do without him.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
So, he's more than
some loan shark

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
who tried to sell our theater?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
You can keep it for the stage.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
The only reason
I'm here is to perform.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
That's the truth.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
Let's get this show on
the road, shall we?

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Moving on.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have each of you
start with a basic intro.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
Then try out the script.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
Do you mind going first, Omi?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
Omi Fushimi. Third year
at Yosei University.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
No theatrical experience.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50% align:center
Great. Now go ahead
with the lines.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.115 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
Hello, Mom.
How you doin'? It's me.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
I just got my test results.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
Yep. I passed it somehow.
No, I really did. Heh.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
I know. I can hardly believe it
either. Catch you later, Mom.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
His delivery's a tad stiff.


00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
But he's got a strong voice.
It'll help him stand out.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
I hope that wasn't
too terrible to watch.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
No way. You did a solid job.
Taichi? You're up next.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Let's go!
Name's Taichi Nanao.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
Second year at Ouka High School.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
And I have zero
acting experience!

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
What's up, Ma? How you doin'?

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
It's me. I finally
got my test results.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I passed it somehow.
Nah, I really did! I know.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
I can hardly believe it either.
I'll catch you later, Mom.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
Well, what'd ya think?

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
That was impressive. You haven't
done theatre before, have you?

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
'Fraid not.
I'm an absolute newbie!

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] That's surprising. Your
work felt so polished to me.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
Which one of you bad boys want
to introduce yourself next?

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
I'm up for the challenge.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
Since when were you
the director?

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
Huh? Listen, you snooze,
you lose.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
According to who, genius?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
Okay, settle down.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
We'll have you read next since
you volunteered to go first.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
I'm Banri Settsu. A third
year at Hanasaki Academy

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
with no theatrical experience.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
Hi, Mom, how're you? Guess what?
I just got my test results.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
He's good!

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I passed it for real.
With flying colors. I know.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
I can hardly believe it either.
Catch you later.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
Holy cow. That was perfect.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
He certainly has what it takes.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
new to acting, too.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
Guilty. Man, show business
is a piece a cake.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Anyway, next please!

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Juza Hyodo.
I'm a third year at Ouka High,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
and I've never done this before.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hmph.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
Hi Mom, how're you doing?

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
It's me. I just got
my test results.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Yep. I passed.
Uh, I passed it.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
I really passed. Uh-huh.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
I can hardly believe it.
Catch you later.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
We all gotta start somewhere.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
[BANRI laughs]
You freaking suck.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Beyond awful. Probably
the worst I've ever heard!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.693 position:50% align:center
[laughs] My stomach hurts!

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
That's not nice, Banri!

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
Just ignore him.
I don't want another fight.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
I know I can't act.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
But still. I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to get better!

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you to let me
join your troupe.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Please, Director.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
It takes guts to say that.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
You're clearly passionate
about this, aren't you?

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
You've got hunger
and your ambition.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
As long as you don't lose
sight of those things,

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
you're more than welcome here.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Don't you worry. I have
a whole caboodle of exercises

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
for baby thespians.
You're in good hands with me.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
I can't thank you enough.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
How can you take him seriously?

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
He stumbled over every
line in the script.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Well. Better to recruit him

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
than an ignorant bully
with mediocre talent.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
Oh, funny. What're you saying,
you elderly weirdo?

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
Disrespectful punk. Don't you
speak to me that way again.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Please, you're the last
one left. Come on down.

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hmph.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Sakyo Furuichi.
As for my experience...

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
I dabbled in some
plays as a child.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
Hello. Mother? It's me.
Well. My results came in.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I aced it.
Finally. Yeah, I know.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
I can hardly believe it either.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
Catch you later, Mom.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] You'd never know that
he hasn't acted in years.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
So natural. He's in
a league of his own.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
Right. Awesome guys.
We're done.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
Everyone's in the cast!

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Yes!

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.887 position:50% align:center
That's a relief.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
There were only five candidates.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
Hip hip hooray!

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Autumn Troupe in the house!

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
Yo, right back atcha!

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.312 position:50% align:center
They weren't gonna
reject anyone.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
Hyodo made it on the roster.

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
Watch your mouth.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
Big talk for a jerk who doesn't
even care about theater.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
Just drop out.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
Get real. My performance
was way better

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
than what you were doing.

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
Between us, you're the one
who should drop out!

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
Go back to your stye, ham.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
Do you guys never stop fighting?

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
I stand by what I said.
Your acting's so hammy

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
they might as well
turn this into a diner!

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
You for real with the
dad humor? You're the one

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
who should take your butt
somewhere else, you creep.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
Nobody wants you here!

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
That's enough. You brats should
learn to shut the hell up.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
The director said that we all
passed so stop arguing.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
Do I make myself clear?

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI whimpers]

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
He's way too scary.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
They're a tough bunch,
aren't they?

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
[BOTH growl]

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hmph.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
Uhh... We've been through a lot.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
But this might be more
than we can handle.

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI whimpering]

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
That just about sums up
everything troupe-related.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
Anyway, was anybody interested
in staying in the dorms?

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
I'd be down.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
Then you can count me in, too.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? There a
problem with me bunking here?

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
Glad that's settled.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
We'll be accommodating Banri
and Juza for the time being.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
You'll need to get permission
from your parents.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
On account of the fact that
you're both still underage.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
Is it cool if I crash, too?

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. That leaves
Omi and Sakyo to decide.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
These fools are hopeless.


00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
They'll need somebody
to keep them in check.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Huh?

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
This is awkward. I wanna move
into the dorm rooms, too.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
But I'm the one who takes care
of things at home, so I can't.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's not
that big a deal.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
You can always commute
to rehearsals.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
No. I've decided
I'm gonna stay here.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
As far as my dad and
brothers go, it's about time

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
they finally learn how to
manage on their own.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
A dramatic change like this
might be good for them.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
Oki-doke. That means all of you
will be living in the dorm.

00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
I recommend putting
Settsu and Hyodo together.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Say what?

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
You want us to kill each other?

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's
the best idea.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
You're basically adding
fuel to an inferno!

00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
What options are there.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.643 position:50% align:center
The way I see it, their
squabbling will eventually hold

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
the rest of the troupe back.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
Therefore, if we
make them roommates,

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
it'll encourage them to
get along and work together.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
That's a hell no.
Let me remind you

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
that you ain't the one
runnin' the show, old man.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
Holing up with that jerk
doesn't make any sense.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
He'd pick a fight with
me 24/7, year-round.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
Are you really comparing me
to a convenience store?

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
You're cheap and dirty,
so yeah, I am!

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
Be quiet. You've no choice,

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
so shut your traps
or I'll do it for you!

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
Now. How do we
proceed from here?

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, right.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
Per the recommendation,
the two of you troublemakers

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
will be sharing room 104.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
--What?
--Hold on!

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
The director's made her
decision and that's final!

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
[JUZA, FURUICHI grunt]

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
She's directing the shows.
And our lives as well.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
One down. That leaves us
with two more rooms.

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
Maybe Mister Furuichi
can get one to himself.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
Since he's the oldest
member of the group.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Sounds good to me.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
Please. No special treatment.

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA]
Hey... Boss...

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
--That idiot.
--...Man!

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
Yo. Big old congratulations
on making it into the company!

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'll be
your number-one fan.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
And your number-one
personal assistant, too!

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
Oh, you. You're Mister
Sakoda, if memory serves.

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
Are you also moving in with us?

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA] Yes ma'am. Lookin'
forward to working with ya.

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
I'll just take a teeny corner
of boss's room.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
I didn't say you could.
Not only that,

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
I don't remember
telling you I was

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
even auditioning
in the first place.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
Can't hide anythin' from me
no matter how hard you try, sir.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
If you don't want me stayin',
I'll make the commute every day.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Seems you're gonna
have visitors often.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
I'd say that's more reason for
you to have a room for yourself.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
Ah, what a pain. I'll
take you up on that offer.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
That leaves room 105, which
I'm giving to Omi and Taichi.

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
You and your visitors can
bunk in room 106, Sakyo.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to it.
Ready for this?

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
You know it, bro!

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
[JUZA growls]

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
[BANRI exhales]

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Whatever it is you're
cooking, it smells bomb!

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
It'll be ready to eat soon.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
I can help prep ingredients.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
How nice of you!

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
Big day. How's the
unpacking going so far?

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
Me and Taichi are
pretty much done.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.786 position:50% align:center
Solid teamwork. And Mister
Furuichi's got Sakoda

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
to help him out,
so he'll be done soon.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I'm glad it's going so well.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
What about Banri
and Juza, though?

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
Be honest. What is it
you're trying to pull?

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Huh?

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
We both know for a fact

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
you couldn't care
less about theater.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
And why's it matter?

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
You got no right to tell me
what I should or shouldn't do.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
I'll be real. I'm doing this
cause we've got

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
a score to settle and
you keep ducking out.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
Looks to me like
you're a big coward.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
I can clown on you

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
by besting you
through acting stuff.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
You joke. Cracks me up
that you're tryin' to act

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
with a mug like that.
Do you think you can play

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
anything other than
a henchman or monster?

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Well, well, well.
You finally ready to go at it?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
Listen here. I'm dead serious
about being the best I can be.

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
You wanna half-ass your way
through this experience,

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
be my guest. But you
won't stand in my way.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
I've been dyin' to hear that.
I propose we hurry up

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
and cut to the chase.
Let our fists do the talkin'!

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
Come on, what's the matter?

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
I didn't care.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
I was willing to do whatever
it took to catch a thrill.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
Sports? School? Fighting?
All fair game.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
I could beat anyone at anything.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
And without breaking
a sweat, either.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
But everyday life left me bored.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
I started getting
into riskier hobbies.

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:12.133 position:50% align:center
Thirsty for something new.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Whether I was
flirting with the law,

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
or placing bets on my safety.
It was a means to an end.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
Life was a game, and I
was playing on easy mode.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
I couldn't wrap my head around
why other people struggled.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
Why they had to try.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Hey, did you hear the news?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Juza Hyodo crushed the
top dog of Yama High.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
What? Not him again.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
[BANRI gasps]

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
Take a swing at me!
C'mon! Do it!

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
Good grief.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
Break it up, that's enough
sparring for today.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
Dinner's ready.
Aren't you guys hungry?

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you're literally
a superhero!

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
What's gives, man? Why'd you
butt in all the sudden?

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
Ooh. Did you hear, BanBan?

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
The director's cooking up
her extra-special curry

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
for us tonight, so hooray!

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] What kind of toppings
do you like in your curry?

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
Did you know that
chicken is my favorite?

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
Who cares, I'll eat whatever.

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
Hey, I wasn't finished
talking to Juzo.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
You won't believe
how nice it smells.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
--Don't want it to get cold!
--[BANRI] Hey!

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Just follow your nose!

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
You good? We should
get going, too.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, there
won't be any left.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Yo, Omi. I think...

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
If I ever let him bait me
into flying off the handle

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
like that...
I need you to stop me.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
I made the choice to take
this as seriously as I can.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
Which means I have to
try to change myself.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
Cause if I fall back
on bad habits,

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
it'll make trouble for
the entire troupe.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
Wow, Juza.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Please.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
I promise, buddy.
I got your back.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to be help
each other out, right?

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's eat.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Well? What's your problem?

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
So! Anyway, friend.
Are you ready?

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
Cause I'm gonna beat your ass!

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
You satisfied?

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] What the hell? I can't
get up. There's no way.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] I lost to you.
But that won't happen again.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Hey, JuJu.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
Hi, Muku.

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
Congrats on making Autumn.

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
You know, I never thought
I'd get the chance

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
to act with you. And--

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
Listen kid. Don't talk
to me while I'm here.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
And don't tell anyone
we're related to each other.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
Not a soul, got it?

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
But this is so great.
I didn't know you wanted to--

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
Also. You really need
to stop calling me JuJu.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Sorry, JuJu--

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
I mean, Juza.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
I guess if people found
that you're related to me,

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
it would be awkward
for you, huh?

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That isn't--

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Break a leg at rehearsal.
Sleep well.

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
If anyone found out you were
related to a punk like me,

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:50.060 position:50% align:center
I'm the idiot who'd end up
making things awkward for you.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. No one can know yet.

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
But I'm gonna do my best
to change my act.

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:08.078 position:50% align:center
Because you inspired me.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
You gave me strength
to move forward.

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
And I promise someday you'll be
proud to call me family, Muku.
