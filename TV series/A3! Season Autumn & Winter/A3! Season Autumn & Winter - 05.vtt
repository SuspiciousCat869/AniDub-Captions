00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.721 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Director?

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.514 position:50% align:center
Why'd you run off?

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center
Uh? [growls]

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
What the hell happened?

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
Who would destroy our costumes?

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
It says, "cancel your show."

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
How dare they screw with us.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
I swear I'm gonna murder
whoever did this!

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
So, what's the plan now?
Tomorrow's the dress rehearsal.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] We'll just have
to use backup costumes.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
But after--

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure they're done.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
You serious? We've got
two days before the opening.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center
I said I'll have them
done in time.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
Whoever did this
is not defeating us!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] In that case,
the dress rehearsal's canceled!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
Gather 'round!

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.026 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.613 position:50% align:center
Change of plans! I need
all of you to help Yuki.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50% align:center
Work as one, and get
the costumes ready

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
for opening night!

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
I-- Good call. I'll have
to announce it right away.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
First off, what
materials do you need?

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Basic suits for each person.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
You've got it. I'll get Sakoda
to purchase them now.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
Tell us how we can help you out.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
I can sew. Basic stuff.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.598 position:50% align:center
I'll master it in no time.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.350 position:50% align:center
I hope so.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
Start by gathering the pieces
and bringing them to me.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.521 position:50% align:center
--[BANRI, JUZA] Got it!
--[OMI] Okay!

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.397 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Let's do this.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.315 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Damn, they went to town.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.483 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI grunts]

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Don't miss anything.
Aw, man, this was mine.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
You helpin' out?

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.325 position:50% align:center
Who, me? Uh. Sure.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
And done!

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
Try them on right now.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
I'll make any quick
adjustments needed.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
Mine is fine.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
No problems here.
I'm that good.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
This is one time
I agree with you.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
You can't see the alterations
unless you look closely.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
No way. The audience
shouldn't see them.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
We were working
against the clock.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
But you made it happen,
wardrobe department!

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
Taichi? Something wrong
with your costume?

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, it's amazing. Thanks.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
You look a little pale.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
Why not get some
sleep before the show?

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
He's right. Last couple of days
you haven't gotten to rest much.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
You need it.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
In fact, all of you need
to take a breather.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
Yuki and I will tidy up.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
Don't we need to rehearse?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
Your first priority is being in
tip-top shape for opening night.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center
--Understood.
--Same here.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
I'm so excited.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] I wonder what
it's gonna be like?

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Starting a show without
a dress rehearsal?

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
It's unheard of, plus,
the boys have barely slept.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Will they be okay?

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO] Ha. You can't even
tell me the right place to go?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Sir! My deepest apologies!

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
My mistake thinking
this trash company

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
would have competent
ushers working.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Is something the matter?

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
I misread his seat number
when I was ushering him in.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
And I was hoping to
make things right.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
I apologize for any
inconvenience.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
I'll take you to your seat.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
No. I'll find it--

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
Hey, now.
Behave yourself, all right?

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
Reni?

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll excuse him.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
This is Haruto Asuka
of God Troupe.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
I'm Reni Kamikizaka,
his supervisor.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
Uh, we share a title,
then. Hello.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
My name's Izumi Tachibana.
I run Mankai.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
Tachibana? Pardon me, but any
relation to Yukio Tachibana?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
Are you acquainted
with my father?

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
[RENI] But of course. Everyone
in this town knows of him.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
Ah. Makes sense.
If you're his daughter,

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
that explains the troupe's
recent success.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
I look forward to seeing
today's performance. Buh-bye.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Ladies and gents.
Welcome to Mankai Company.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
Tonight, will be the
debut of a new play.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
<i>The Roman Episode </i>performed
by the Autumn Troupe.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
Our show will begin shortly.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI gasping]

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Boss? Hey, boss?
Please, believe me!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
I would never betray your trust!

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI gasps]

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
Did he just blank on his line?

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
I've got all the
evidence I need.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
So, save the smooth talk.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
You're here, too?

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
Agree? Boss?

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
Yeah. No point in denying
you're the traitor, Luciano.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
He said Capone's line
to save Sakyo.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
Nice save, Juza.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Everyone! Great job
out there tonight!

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
You went in cold
without rehearsal.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
But everyone made it
through in one piece.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
No.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my performance.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
You did fine.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
Dude, stop being
so hard on yourself.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
In the end, everything worked
out okay, thanks to Juza.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
Just go forward and make sure

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
you're careful during
the next shows.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
Still though, not gonna lie.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect you to be
the one who bombed a line.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
I won't make excuses.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Right. I'm headin' out.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Take care, you guys.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
And get some rest
when you make it home.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.261 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Something the matter?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
You ought to head back
with the others.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
I've always dreamed
of being on the stage.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
To think I made such
an amateur mistake.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be blaming
yourself. You haven't slept.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
Plus, you went on
without a rehearsal.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] That doesn't change
anything. I'm responsible.

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
However, I suppose that

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
I've learned something
from all of this.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
I now see the cost
of waiting too long

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
to pursue one's
greatest ambition.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
It's far too late for me.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
If I needed proof I don't belong
anywhere near a stage,

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
I've got it.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Stop talking that way!

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
Can't you see how
important you are?

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
You've been a massive
help this whole season.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
Especially on my end.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
The Autumn Troupe's teamwork
would be nonexistent

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
if you weren't guiding them.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
Without your advice
and encouragement,

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't have
made it this far.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
So why? Why do you
act like this?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
Almost as if you're not
on the same level

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
as the rest of
the Autumn Troupe.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying you have
to compete with them.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
Like Banri and Juza.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
But at least see
yourself as an equal.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
How can I when they're
younger than me?

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
But your age shouldn't
be a factor!

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
For once, don't run away!

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
Why shouldn't I? Why?

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
I'm asking, stay here with us.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
And please continue
performing on this stage.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
Because I want you to shine
the brightest out of everyone.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
Yes, you'll make mistakes.
Make a ton of them.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
And gain experience.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you won't progress.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
Not until you push
your old self aside.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
I don't think you realize it,

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
but you aren't the same person
who gave up on theater!

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
Don't get smart with me.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
I apologize.

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
I'm going to make you
regret inspiring me

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
to give it everything I've got.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
Luciano, I would've never
taken you for a traitor.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
Well, Lansky?

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
Can I trust you, or are you
also going to betray me?

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
That was amazing.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN D] Yeah. Especially the
actor who was playing Capone.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
I mean the two leads
were outstanding and all,

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
but clearly the boss was
a better trained actor.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
Dammit!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
You upset about how Sakyo
completely stole the show today?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
And it won't just be today.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
Better step up your game,

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
or the audience is
going start thinking

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
I'm the lead actor here.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
Says the geezer who forgot
his lines yesterday!

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna lose.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.265 position:50% align:center
That's more like it.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:44.310 position:50% align:center
Can't let these three beat us,
can we? Uh... Taichi?

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50% align:center
I gotta run to the
bathroom real quick.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm? Taichi?

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
Let him be.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
But--

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you can
do to help right now.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrating]

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Hello?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
[RENI] What in the world's
going on over there?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
<i>The Roman Episode</i>'s
popularity is skyrocketing.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:24.851 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
I'm sorry.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
I'll give you one last chance.

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow on closing night--
you're to wreak havoc.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
I don't care if
you have to scream

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
at the top of
your lungs on stage

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
or punch someone
in the front row.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
You'll do whatever is necessary.
Because as you're aware,

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
if you do dare to fail me,

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
you'll never perform
anywhere again.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
[dial tone]

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Taichi?

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
Somethin' wrong?

00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI gasps]
I screwed up.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
Omi. What should I do?

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
I-- I don't know
what I should do!

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
I don't want to...

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:20.240 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
First of all, calm down.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
Now go ahead and tell me.
What's wrong?

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] It was me. I did it
all! I cut up our costumes.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
And wrote those
threatening letters.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
Believe me, hurting the troupe
was the last thing I wanted!

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
After everything I've done,

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
the right choice would be
to abandon the troupe.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
There's no way you would
share the stage with me.

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
All right, come on.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI gasps]

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be okay.
Hey, it will.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
But...

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Look. I've known for
a while that something

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
was weighing heavy on your mind.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.078 position:50% align:center
But I didn't do
anything to help you.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
I'm partially responsible, too.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
Let's go and apologize together.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
Stop making it sound like
I even have a chance!

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
There's no way
they'll forgive me!

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect to feel this
bad but you guys are cool.

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.474 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen to me.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
Everything will be okay, watch.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
You were behind everything?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
You haven't told us
why you did it.

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
Because I was originally a
member of the God Troupe.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] I never got my big
break as a performer.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Then one day, out of the blue,
Reni called me into his office.

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
He asked if I would
join Mankai Company

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
and act as his spy.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
A spy?

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
He promised to give me a major
role in a God Troupe production.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
But only if I ruined the
Autumn Troupe's performance.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
You don't--

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
You don't know how sorry I am!

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
I need to apologize, too.
Please, forgive me.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Are you also a spy?

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
And you said you
were only following

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
Reni Kamikizaka's orders?

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
--[TAICHI] Yes.
--I don't care.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm sorry, guys.
You trusted me. I'm sorry!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
All right. So do your portrait.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
I thought I knew everyone
until I saw their one man shows.

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:45.760 position:50% align:center
Then, I realized we need to
reveal more of who we are.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Especially now.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
Watching Hyodo's, it rekindled
my passion to defeat him.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
And now I understand
why the old man nags

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
the crap out of us all the time.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
I also get why Omi
feels more mature.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
Even though he's not
much older than me.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
Thing is,
only Taichi's felt off.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
It's time. You're gonna
show us your real portrait.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
I don't mean the one you
did before, sound good?

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll understand
why this happened.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
Right. You're on. I'll do it.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
This is a portrait
of Taichi Nanao.

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
Since I was young,
I wanted people to like me.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
No, to love me.
But even in elementary school

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
I never stood out
much from the crowd.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
For example, no one
would even notice

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
if I was out sick.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
I wasn't smart or athletic.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
And it wasn't as if I had
any cool talents to share.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
All I had was zero chance
of making an impact.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
I remember when Ultra yo-yos
became this popular fad.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
I practiced like crazy.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
Thinking that if I mastered
some awesome trick,

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
I'd suddenly be popular.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
I practiced for hours
every single day.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
Until I finally learned
a half decent trick.

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
But by then, the whole
obsession with yo-yos

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
had already passed.
No one cared.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
Then again, that was me:
slow to pick stuff up.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
Just one time,
I grabbed people's attention.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
When I was on TV.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
A relative got me a small part.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
I was just an extra,
but it didn't matter to me.

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
The next day at school,

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
kids from my class and
students I didn't even know

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
began flocking me.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
Gushing about how they saw me

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
on the television
the night before.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center
And how amazed they were.

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
For once, it felt like people

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
were actually paying
attention to me.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
I knew this was the best
chance I'd have to stand out!

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
So, I begged my parents
to send me to an academy

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
for child actors and later
auditioned for a bunch

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
of roles in different plays
and television shows.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I only landed
parts as a background extra.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
But then I met him.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
He was a lead for a TV show I
was playing a bystander in.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
It was Tenma Sumeragi,
a high school peer.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
It's a humbling experience,

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
meeting someone who
possesses innate charm.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
Made me realize just how
little charisma I actually had.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
I felt hopeless. I could never
be as magnetic as he was.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
I even went so far as dying my
hair and changing my wardrobe,

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
but it didn't help.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
I couldn't change
who I was inside.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
Still, I didn't want to give up.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
It didn't matter if I got cast
as a passerby or an extra,

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
I was desperate.
And then, by some miracle,

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
I became part of the
God Troupe's ensemble.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
I always watched from the wings

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
while I long to
stand center stage.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
It felt like some kinda
out-of-reach dream.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
I was an extra.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
Nothing had changed
from when I was

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
back in elementary school.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
Was this the role I
was destined to play?

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
I thought I had more to offer?

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.127 position:50% align:center
I was shocked when
Reni summoned me.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you want me
to be a spy for you,

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
and sabotage the Mankai troupe?

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I didn't want
to hurt the troupe.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
It meant defiling the
very pursuit I loved.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
But then,
Reni made me a promise.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
If I ruined the production,

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
he'd give me a big part
in the next play.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
At long last...

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
...I'd finally stand
center stage!

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
A role that'd have
tons of lines!

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
I could show the world
I was an actor!

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
It made me so emotional
that I accepted Reni's offer.

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
I told him yes.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Without thinking about
who it would hurt.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
The name's Taichi Nanao,
everyone!

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
Sure, I've got zero
acting experience,

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
but I'm here to
impress the ladies!

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
And that's the story of how
I joined Mankai Company.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
It's ironic. After I joined,
I was surprised to find out

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
I'd be acting along
Tenma Sumeragi.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
Later, I met the rest
of Autumn Troupe.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
There was Banny,
who I always secretly envied.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
Everything came
so easily to him.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
And I'll admit,
when I first met Juza,

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
I was a little relieved
to discover

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
I was less awkward
than he seemed to be.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
But gradually, the more and more
I got to know the real him,

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
I realized that he had a
straightforward passion

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
for acting I couldn't
help but admire.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
No. It wasn't just him,
but everyone else, too.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.518 position:50% align:center
Even though we all want to act,
I'm nothing like you.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
And I can never be after lying

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
and cheating my way
into landing a role.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
The more time I spent
with you guys,

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
the further away
from the troupe I felt.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
I can't be one of you.
And I shouldn't be.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
I dishonored what it means
to be an actor.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
I don't have
the right to perform.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
I know

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
that I've committed crimes
that can never be forgiven.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
Um, hi?

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I didn't see
what was going on.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
Must've been tough.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
What? It's not your fault.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Let's get one thing clear,

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
I'm in no way forgiving
what you did.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
But I forgive you as a person.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
Which is it?

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
Condemn the offense,
but not the offender.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
Meaning that Juza
forgives everything.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Mm-hm.

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
Then why didn't you say
so from the start? Jeez.

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center
I want-- I want to act
alongside the Autumn Troupe.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
To finish our last
performance together

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
and to make it the best show
people have ever seen!

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
Us, too.

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
But tell us which
Taichi Nanao you are.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
Are you the Taichi
from God Troupe?

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
Or the one that we all know?

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] The one you know,
but it's too late.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Go ahead. You can say it.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
Say out loud where you truly
belong so everyone can hear it.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
Just be honest with yourself
and the rest of us.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
I am-- I'm...

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
My name's Taichi Nanao!

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
And I'm with the Mankai
Company's Autumn Troupe!

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
[BANRI laughs]
Pretty good job.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
But man, Reni Kamikizaka.
That freakin' bastard.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
He's a disgrace to anyone who's
ever called themselves an actor.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Truth.

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
What if he tries
something again?

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
No use for us to worry about
what if. We'll be fine.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
Because all we can do is
to perform our best. Right?

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] What do you say, guys?
Tomorrow's the big night!

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
Let's make the closing
performance a hit!

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.040 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mankai!

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.502 position:50% align:center
Yeah!
