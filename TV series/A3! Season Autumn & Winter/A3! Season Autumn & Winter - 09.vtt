00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.804 position:50% align:center
Shall I begin?

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
A montage, faraway and
an endless dÃ©cantage.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
The faded memories
of one's youth.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
Write a different poem,
would ya?

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
You should appreciate
a poet's process.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
Tsumugi, we gotta talk.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
[door creaks, slams]

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
Those two are acting odd.
Don't you think?

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
[yelps] But no one's heard me
perform this one before!

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.091 position:50% align:center
Today is Saturday,
November the 12th.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
And this is your morning
news for the weekend.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.972 position:50% align:center
It looks like we're living
through November 12th again.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.473 position:50% align:center
What could've caused
this to happen?

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
This is the key?
It's just a weird plushie.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
I didn't say I was
entirely sure.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.278 position:50% align:center
But the night before
the time loop started,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
it fell right out of the sky.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.532 position:50% align:center
When the day repeats,
it's always in here, though.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
So basically, it's the
only thing that exists

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
outside the loop.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
Could the plushie
somehow repeat days?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
Maybe. Let's show it
to the others.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
They might help us find answers.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Ooh! There it is!

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
So, you're responsible for
depriving me of my triangles!

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
Man. The Torment Doll
lives up to its name.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
Like the one from the urban
legend? You're joking, right?

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect it
to be so cute.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
Ugly, is more like it.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
What's the difference?

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
The real issue at hand is
all my precious triangles

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
I find keep disappearing
the next day!

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
Then you also know
about the time loop!

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
Sure, who doesn't?

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:29.125 position:50% align:center
Nobody else. From what
we can tell at least.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
I dunno if it's just us,
but it's your fault.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
So, you better come up with
a way to fix it and pronto,

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
you understand?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
And how is it our fault?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
Remember what the manager
said 'bout the friends?

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
Both of 'em were stuck living
the same day over

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
and over until they
made up with each other!

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
There's no way that
story is actually true.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] Make up or we'll be
stuck in this circle forever.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
And do it in front of the doll!
Or else it won't count!

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
Time to fly! Catch ya later!

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
Hey, where are you
headed off to?

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
To find other triangles,
of course!

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
Bye!

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
And like that, he's gone.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
No luck today. We're gonna start
over at zero again tomorrow.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
I suppose we could
both try making up.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me how though.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
You don't think holding
hands would help?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Maybe punching instead.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Well, come on.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
I can't come up with a
better plan, so let's try.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
Just hurry it up. Hand in hand.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
There we go. Everything's
back the way it was.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
You really think that's all
it takes to end the loop?

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
Well? You got a better idea?

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
Put our arms on each
other's shoulders?

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
All right, whatever.
Ya see? We made up.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
Good luck convincing anyone

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.114 position:50% align:center
we're on good terms
again when you've got

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
that grouchy expression
on your face.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
I am not grouchy!

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
Now there's a smile.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
Whoa. I never thought I would
ever see you look so dazzling.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
Blame it on God Troupe's
training, all right?

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
Now you give a try!

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
Show those teeth!

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI chuckles]

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
Not bad.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
We're best buds, see?

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Inseparable friends.
That's us.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be something
we're missing here.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
Uh... Maybe if we laugh?

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
Or just stand there
while I look like an idiot.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing nervously]

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
Man, that's a tough crowd.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
Might also help if we
joke around a little.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Hey.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You fell for it!

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
So lame. That prank was popular
back in elementary school.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
I'm trying, so don't judge me.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
If you haven't noticed,
I'm sick of this.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] Covered all our bases.
Now we wait and see.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Yeah. Sure.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
I hope tomorrow's
really tomorrow.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI laughs]

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
It didn't work.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
Dammit! We went through all
that trouble for nothing!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
You two. My triangle
disappeared again!

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
We tried a buncha
different things

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
to break the cycle, honest.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
The problem is there's
never gonna be

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
any solid proof
we're on good terms.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
You're both way overthinking it!

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how
you do it, you just need

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
to get your true feelings
across to each other!

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
And for the sake
of my triangles,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
you better make up today!

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
Express our true feelings,
however we can.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's go.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure, but where?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
No time for questions.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Hey, wait.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] All right.
This spot oughta work.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
Enough's enough, got it?

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] You heard me!
I'm through putting up

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
with your crap!
Whatever we had its over with!

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
Never talk to me again!

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
But what's gotten into you
all of a sudden? Is this a...?

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
Yeah. An improv street act,
so help me out

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
and start matching my
energy level, why don't you?

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
Uh. That's a tall order.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
Why am I not surprised?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50% align:center
You were never able
to make up your mind!

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
I can't stand to see you!

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so overbearing?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.022 position:50% align:center
Dad is gone and I'm the oldest.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Which makes me the
head of this household

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
whether I like it or not.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you?

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
How'd you expect me to know?

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
Look at it from my perspective!
You never told me Dad was sick!

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
And how was I supposed
to know you took over

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
the family business, either?

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
You would've... If you bothered
stopping by the house.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
how a phone works?

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
You're never gonna
change, either.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
You always say
what you're thinking.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
Except the important stuff
others should hear about.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:17.640 position:50% align:center
What, do you think I can
read your mind or something?

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
Goin' around, assuming
everyone already knows

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
what you know is
just plain arrogant!

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like you can even handle
your own responsibilities!

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
You have no right to lecture me.

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
Huh. One thing's
painfully obvious.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
There's no getting
through your thick skull.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
So, I guess we'll have
to settle this in court.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
Do your worst.
Let's see what you've got.

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Bravo!

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
The tension was killing me!

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
What an incredible performance!

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
There was a crowd?
How long were they here?

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
Quick. Let's take a bow.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
[applause continues]

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
Since we've performed
a street act together.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
The way you jumped
into the scene

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
totally caught me off guard.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
So random. I didn't even
realize we had an audience.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We got caught up
in the moment.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
You brought the heat
midway through.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
If that part seemed
more authentic,

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
it's 'cause I was
actually angry.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
For real? So, are you telling me
that you weren't acting?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
Maybe for a little bit.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
Feels nostalgic.
It's kinda nice.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
We used to do stuff like
this all the time back

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
when we were students.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we sure did. That's
why I figured it might be

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
the best way for us
to talk out our issues.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
I did enjoy myself.
It's always such a trip.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
I can never predict how
you'll respond to my choices.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
That's how it is for me, too.
I learn something different

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
whenever I see you
take the stage.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
And it makes me wanna keep
training until I get better.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
Hopefully even better than you.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
Remember what happened
that one time.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
In elementary school?

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
I was the shy kid who
scored the lead role.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
And you were my supporting lead.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
There was this unforgettable
rush of emotion

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
like I accomplished something.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
It made me want
to keep acting forever.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.503 position:50% align:center
We ended up doing theater
through middle school

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
and high school, and every year
chewing the scenery together

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
was a thrill that never got old.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
And even after we both of us
graduated from college,

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
I was dying to join
God Troupe with you.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] But as it turned out,
I didn't quite make the cut.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
I was devastated.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
I couldn't handle the rejection,
so I gave up.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
Despite that, I wasn't able
to let go of my dream.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
I needed that feeling you get

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
waiting in the wings
for the curtain to rise.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
I had to try again. Which is
why I came back to the city.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
Well, what exactly are you
planning to do about it now?

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
You want me to
take the lead role.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
Will we beat God Troupe
that way?

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
What I want is to
stand up on stage

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
as our leading actor
with my head held high.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
Cause if you do, then you
should say it to the others.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
Don't stop fighting
for yourself!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
I got your back, you know?

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You mean it?

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
Of course I do. We're in
the same troupe, aren't we?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.867 position:50% align:center
We stick together.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
Those are some impressive
words of encouragement.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
Makes me feel like
I'm unstoppable.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
Definitely reminds me
of old times.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
Listen. When we were younger--

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Yo. It's Tsumugi and Tasuku!

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
What're you guys up to?
Hangin' out?

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
Something like that.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
And how 'bout you two?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
We picked up groceries
for dinner.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
We've got more members now.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
So, it isn't a
one-man job anymore.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
Here. We can give you
a hand with those bags.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
You really mean it?

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center
We'd be happy to help.
Uh. Right, Tasuku?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally.
I'll grab one of those.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Sweet.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
Thanks for helping.

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
No problem.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Here we go.
What should I say to them?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. Let's eat first.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
Then you can just tell them
the same thing you told me.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
Later, then.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
Listen everybody,
there's something important

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
that I need to get off my chest.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
The theater was my passion
for as long as I can remember.

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
Until I abandoned it. I got so
discouraged after Tasuku and I

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
auditioned for God Troupe.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
Their director said
horrible things to me.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
That I was hopeless.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
That I should pack it in
and quit trying

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
to pretend I had
any future onstage.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds like something
the bastard would say.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
He's a total jackass.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
I used to be stronger.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
I got praised for
my performances

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
and won a couple awards.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
So, I had a fair amount of
confidence up to that point.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
But I fell apart.
Mr. Kamikizaka's words stung.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
My passion became
a source of fear.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
I ran away from the city.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
Then I ended up working a job
in a different industry.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
And yet I still couldn't
give up entirely.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
I was so desperate to lose
myself on stage again.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
That whole time.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
Even though my day-to-day life

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
had nothing to do
with the theater,

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
I realized that this
was my true calling.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.539 position:50% align:center
I decided to stop denying it.

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.042 position:50% align:center
I took a big leap of faith
and moved back here.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
So I could commit myself
to chasing my dream.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
That's why we should
go on with the act-off.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
The odds don't look great.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
And I can't promise we'll win.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
But I'm sick and tired
of running away.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
No more, I'm ready
to face life head-on!

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
If God Troupe wants to challenge
us, then I say we accept.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
I know what it's like
to have regrets.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
I don't want any more.
I'm begging you.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
We could lose this.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
Maybe. And I apologize if I'm
being a little selfish here.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
But I swear I'll do everything
to see this through.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
Better make sure you do.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
I won't be letting you
off so easy next time.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
All right, let's do this!

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah. There's no way we're
turning down this fight.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
You miss every shot
you don't take.

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
Which is the worst kind
of regret to have.

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
It sounds to me like we should
give this everything we've got.

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
You have the Spring Troupe's
unconditional support.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
You'll blow 'em away!

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
So how about the rest of you.
Gonna sign up for this?

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
Huh. Goodness.

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
I suppose we'll be in
for a bumpy ride.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
We'll see. It depends on what
the boss lady says, of course.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
I'll do what I can,
as long as you'll have me.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:32.992 position:50% align:center
What's this? It's not
every day you see him awake.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
I was able to entice
his attention

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
with these marshmallows.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
That makes more sense.

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
As you can tell,
the entirety of Mankai Company

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
has voiced their
unanimous support,

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
and are willing to
take on God Troupe.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
What say you?

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
I guess we--

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
We gotta show those
losers who's boss!

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
Listen up, everyone. We're going
to enter the act-off.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
God Troupe's in for a surprise!

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
That's right! And then
we'll pay off our loan!

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Tasuku. Hey, wake up, already!

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Hm...? Where's the fire?

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
We made it out!

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
The date changed!

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
Uh? Ow! Well, what do you
know, it's November 13th!

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
That means we finally managed
to escape the time loop!

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
[RENI] So, have you
come to a decision yet?

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
Yes. You can consider this

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
official confirmation
that Mankai will accept

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
God Troupe's challenge,
Mr. Kamikizaka.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
You should be aware

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
that you'll be up against
the entire Company.

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
I hope you're prepared.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
Believe me,
I look forward to it.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
However, there's
still the matter

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
of what the theme will be.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, angels?

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
It'll definitely be different

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
from anything
we've put on before.

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
Spectacular shows with
crazy production values

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
are what those losers are about.
The ball is in their court.

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
Traditionally,
the challenger's the one

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
who sets the theme for the play.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
It's their call.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
Betcha they did it cause
they're scared they'll lose.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Why else give themselves
such an advantage?

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's simply because
they want there

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
to be no doubt
who the winner is.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
[BANRI chuckles] Now that's
what I'm talkin' about, bro.

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
Beating someone
at their own games'

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
the best kinda victory.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
Angels. Huh.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
Okay. What type of story
are we thinking of?

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
Obviously, it must be
a magnificent tale

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
of epic proportions with
a breathtaking script

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
and dazzling costumes
that theater patrons

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
will be raving about for years!

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
Which is exactly what
the other guys

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
will be aiming to accomplish.
So, we should avoid doing that.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
I know you're not implying that
we couldn't do a better job.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
It's not about skill.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
Their budget's higher
than anyone else's.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
It's in a league of its own.
We'd screw ourselves over.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
If we try making our show look
expensive, then they'll win.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
Big budget or not, we have
to stick to the rules,

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
it isn't like we really have the
option to pick another theme.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us, we won't
need to change it.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
What are you proposing?

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
We should think outside the box

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
and try to get to the heart
of the imagery of angels.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
Like break it down.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
That way we can
develop a concept

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
that doesn't copy theirs.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
When you say imagery, do you
mean what they might look like?

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
Are you suggesting
that we all wear a halo

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
and have a pair of wings
sprouting from our backs?

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
Let's ignore physical
appearance for now.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
They're holy,
supernatural beings.

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
That sounds right.
They're also a symbol of purity.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
We should also brainstorm
the genre of the play.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
Stories involving angels tend
to have somber endings?

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Hm. A dramatic tragedy
with an angelic protagonist

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
would be an intriguing tale.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
How 'bout it? Do you
think it could work?

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
Can we write something
that God Troupe wouldn't?

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
So, you're asking for
an original narrative

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
with an angelic
theme tailored to

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
the mature qualities
of the Winter Troupe.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
And it has to be a tragedy?

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
Hm... I can whip something up.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
This is exciting.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
Although a more nuanced acting
style might be called for.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
That'll require more
subtle costume designs.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
A grounded approach.

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
But we'll still need
to impactful enough

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
to leave an impression.

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
You realize that's easier
said than done.

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
You saying you can't do it?

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
I can give it a shot.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
We all in? Because if
nobody has objections,

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
I guess the debut
of Winter Troupe's

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
gonna be one big tragedy.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
You betcha.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA grunts]

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
That sounds good to me.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
I've absolutely
nothing against it.

00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:23.301 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Finished!

00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:29.933 position:50% align:center
Somebody pulled
another all-nighter.

00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:33.186 position:50% align:center
Is that our script
he's got in his hand?

00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:34.979 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Looks like it.

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:41.820 position:50% align:center
It's such a different tone
from our past productions.

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:44.614 position:50% align:center
So emotional. It's perfect.

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:46.116 position:50% align:center
This is really impressive.

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
There're so many great
lines that I'm excited

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:49.661 position:50% align:center
to try and take off
the page already.

00:22:49.703 --> 00:22:52.539 position:50% align:center
It's truly beautiful writing.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.127 position:50% align:center
And fits the theme well, too.
The tragedy makes it sing.

00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:58.878 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:03.967 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Whatcha think, Tasaku?
You look pretty happy.

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:05.927 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time since
I've gotten to perform

00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:07.554 position:50% align:center
in a play like this.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.139 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.557 position:50% align:center
When I was in God Troupe,

00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:13.518 position:50% align:center
I was always stuck playing some
version of the charming prince.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.228 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
That must get old.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.855 position:50% align:center
It would appear
being the golden boy

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:19.607 position:50% align:center
of a popular company comes
with its own baggage.

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.443 position:50% align:center
It's another chance to shine.

00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:24.112 position:50% align:center
I can tell Tasuku's excited
to begin rehearsals.

00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:25.739 position:50% align:center
I bet he's not the only one.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.159 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA laughs]
I don't suppose he is.

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:33.371 position:50% align:center
All right, enough
beating around the bush.

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:35.749 position:50% align:center
Shall we dive into our very
first read-through?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.375 position:50% align:center
Let's do this thing.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
Should be interesting.

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.795 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to count me in.

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
Here we go!
