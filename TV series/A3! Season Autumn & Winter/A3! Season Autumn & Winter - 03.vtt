[beeping]

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.224 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Yo, coming to rehearsal?

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Go ahead.
I'll get up when I feel like it.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.242 position:50% align:center
You hungry?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.370 position:50% align:center
Omi! This looks so delish!

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
And well deserved after
how hard we worked.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center
Hope you like it, everybody!

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50% align:center
[yawns] So tired.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
Banri, you showed up.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Mornin' there, Director.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center
How come you didn't rehearse
with the rest of us?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.593 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That was my bad.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
The comforter kept refusing
to let me escape.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.641 position:50% align:center
But it's not a big deal.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.852 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I can still act
circles around these guys

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
without ever showing up
to practice once. Trust.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.775 position:50% align:center
Sweet. You whipped up
Spanish omelets?

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.361 position:50% align:center
Hey, Omi. Don't forget
about mine, kay?

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
And a cup a coffee, too.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.824 position:50% align:center
--Little punk!
--[BANRI] Huh?

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
Just leave it.
Like it'll do any good.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
[BANRI, JUZA]
Hmph.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
Oh, I assure you.
Things are going smoothly!

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
They're done with read-throughs.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
Next up are start-to-finish
rehearsals.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. That's right!

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
Speaking of the Autumn Troupe...

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
You got some sort special
assignment for me, Boss?

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
Luciano. Lansky.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
You two are gonna pair up
and work as a team.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
--Say what?
--Outta the question!

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Took the words
right outta my mouth!

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center
You don't really expect me
to team up

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
with Cheapskate
Lansky over here?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
What if his poorness
is contagious?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Speak for yourself!

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
What if being an
asshole's a disease?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't touch you
with a ten-foot pole!

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] I wouldn't touch you
with a 20-foot one!

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
Both of you, shut it!

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.411 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
Where do you two think you are,
back on the schoolyard?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
Man the hell up
and get to work, now!

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
For real though, what'd I say?

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
Wasn't I good even without
this morning's rehearsal?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
I know. Your acting's fine,
the problem is, Banri?

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
The real problem
is his hammy acting.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
I sure as hell don't want to
catch whatever asshole disease

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
you've got or touch you.
Not with a ten-foot pole!

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Try speeding up
your delivery a bit.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.
I sure as hell don't--

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
wanna catch your
asshole disease!

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well, one thing he
won't catch is talent.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't have mattered
if he came to rehearsal at all.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
Dude's so pathetic.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! You guys look great!

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50% align:center
Of course they do.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
And you managed to finish
the costumes in record time.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
'Cause I just altered
store-bought clothes.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Neo Gangster. Scoot over and
stand next to Standard Gangster.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
Huh? Neo?

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
Am I Standard?

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If you're gonna make
a scene, do it on stage.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
Now hold still so I can
see whether or not

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
you balance each other out.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Nice! They're like
partners in crime.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hmph.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's Ma's turn.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
My name's 'Ma'?

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, though.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
The costume does a good job of
concealing your motherly aura.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, you got the whole
crooked cop vibe down pat.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Ya know what?

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
Of course,
the money-grubbing yakuza

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
looks like his usual self.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
I have to agree.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
Watch your tongue.
More importantly,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
you did make sure this was all
within the budget, didn't you?

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
Like you even need to ask.
How 'bout you, Dumb Dog?

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
Dumb Dog?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
Dumb Dog, reporting!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
How's your costume?

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Uh. Perfect! Yep!

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
Next time,
don't keep me in suspense.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
We don't have a second to
waste prepping for the show.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
Sir, yes sir! He looks
so much like her...

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
Uh! Oh, no one,
just my first love

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
who used to live
next door to me.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
Had a sharp tongue like
you wouldn't believe.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
Would always called me
mean nicknames, like 'shorty.'

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
She had this tomboyish quality.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
And a personality
exactly like his.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
I do hope we can
meet again someday.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
So she can watch me
perform on the stage.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
Almost sounds like--

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA] I have returned! Told
you I'd deliver, didn't I, Boss?

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
Got the goods you wanted,
Miss Rurikawa!

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Top-notch pieces,
every single one of 'em!

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
Those guns aren't--

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
Smuggled?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Uh?

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI whimpering]

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
These are merely toys,
obviously. They're our props.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
Oh, good. Cause
Sack-o-Dumb here

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
might've actually
brought us real firearms.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
Still, though. They look
pretty convincing.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
Got a hefty weight
for being toys.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and the guns
aren't the only thing

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
that look convincing.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, isn't this...
You bought an Ultra Yo-Yo!

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
I don't remember
requesting that.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I found it on
same site as the shooters.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
Reminded me of the old days

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't help
myself! Cool, huh?

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
Think it's still cool after I
deduct the cost from your pay?

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
Not that!
Thought you'd be into it.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
You'll forgive him after
checking out my mad skills!

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI laughs]

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
He wasn't messin' around.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
I used to practice
like crazy. Paid off.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hm...

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but this is one category
even you can't out do me.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
We'll see about that.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI gasping]

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
[gasps] He's incredible!

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
That should be enough for now.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Yo-yoing was my passion,

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
and I'm no match for you.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
Do you know how many
years of my life

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
I spent trying to be the best?

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
It's my burden to bear.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
I can do anything
after seeing it just once.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
No fair!

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
This is bad! Really bad!

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
What're you going on about?

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Look! I found this
in the mailbox today!

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
We were sent a threating letter?

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
Total nonsense. Just ignore it.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
Probably some coward's
idea of a prank.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.260 position:50% align:center
And if they do try
and start anything,

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
they messed with
the wrong troupe.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
Glad you guys are in our corner.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
Still. It's better
to be safe than sorry.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
We'll keep an eye out for now.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's smart.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] So apparently you
and Lansky are hitting it off.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
I mean, who would've thought?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
That was totally the
right call to make.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
Just a fair warning, though.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't put too
much faith in the guy.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.705 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hm? Boss, what do ya mean?

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
You'll figure it out
soon enough.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Well, I didn't believe
Matsukawa at first.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
But here you are, in the flesh!

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI growls]

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time!
How's the little brat?

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
Did he call you a brat?

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
Why'd you invite him?

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think he more
or less invited himself.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Aw, don't be that way.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
I helped out in
the Spring and Summer.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
It's only fair I do
the same for them. So...

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
Doing rehearsals?
Show me, from the top!

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.529 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
You never learn, huh?

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. I'm good
with whatever.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
We'll be jacks-of-all-trades.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
That hardly sounds like a plan.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
But I guess...
it doesn't sound too bad.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hmph.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Hmph.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
So, thoughts or criticisms?

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Yeah. I've got plenty to say.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
Forget technique.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
You're not putting yourselves
into these characters

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
even the slightest bit.
We're talking Acting 101.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
The Summer troupe's problem

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
was they showed too
much of themselves.

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
Whereas you guys
don't reveal anything.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
Whole thing feels shallow.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
Audience'll never be fooled by
some slap dash character sketch.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
It's only gonna work if
the acting feels authentic.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
Real enough to deceive 'em.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
We're deceiving them?

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
Weren't these roles specifically
written for you guys?

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
So, stop resisting and start

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center
putting more of
yourself into them!

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
All right. But how should they?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
I suggest you all do portraits.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
And what are portraits?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center
Basically, each of you
will put on a one-man show

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
based on your own life.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
You'll each have five minutes,
max! On top of acting,

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
you're also responsible for
writing and directing the piece.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
All on our own?

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
Once you're ready,

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
you'll perform them on stage
as the opening act

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
before my troupe's performance.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
You believe that this
is the best method

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
of making us vulnerable?

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Problem is,
telling your entire history

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
would be too broad a task.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
The topic needs
to be more focused.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
You'll share your
biggest regret in life.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
That's a tall order.

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
Wait till I get to the part
about how I'm setting up

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
a survey for the
audience afterwards.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
You're gonna rank the portraits?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
Personally, I think this
is just what they need.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
From what I can see,

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
some of them are ready
to begin even now.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're about
to get some hard proof

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
I'm better than you.
You excited?

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
I won't lose.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
[JUZA exhales]

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
What's up?

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] You tell me.
You're looking rather grim.

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
Is that your portrait?

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
I know the subject.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
I just don't know how to
consolidate the whole story.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] At least you're not
struggling for an idea.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
Try starting off by writing down

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
everything you
feel and remember.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Then, go back and trim any parts
that aren't necessary.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
And you? What's your subject?

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
You'll see.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! Hell Tower
has been conquered!

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, how're things going
with the Autumn Troupe?

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
You guys are doing
portraits, right?

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Started on yours?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Haven't written a single word.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
You're kidding.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] I've been coasting
through this world

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
on easy mode my whole life.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
I've got no clue what
my biggest regret is.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
Probably don't have one.

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
I'll just exaggerate a couple
of things and make it work.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
Good luck. Cause I'm
pretty sure the director

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
will see right through that.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
Huh? You think so?
Didn't expect that from you.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well. You might
want to get started on it.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, troupe's done for.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Ohh. Fixing a midnight snack?

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
Caught me. The troupe seems
to enjoy my home cooking.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
Especially Juza.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
He does everything
he can to hide it.

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
So, I like to put extra heaps of
jam and cream on his as a treat.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center
You've got a big heart, Omi.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
It's strange. They're so alike.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
He reminds me of my best friend.
He died three years back.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
Hey, Director.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
While we're waiting around
for these scones to bake,

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
would you mind listening
to me practice my scene?

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
This is my portrait.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
I remember when I
used to have a dream.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
But I turned my back
on it a long time ago.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
As a child, I was brought
up by my mother,

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
who was a single parent.
We were poor.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
I couldn't take part in
many clubs or activities.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
Despite that, there was
one thing I discovered.

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
A place that was like a refuge.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
It always seemed
so full of joy...

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
The newly constructed
Mankai dorm.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Ever since that day,
I've been living in his stead.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Back then, the Wolves

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
were the strongest street
gang in West Tokyo.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
We led them together.
People knew us as Omi,

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
the Crazy Wolf, and
Nachi, the Crazy Fox.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
The ultimate team.
During the intense brawls

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
when you couldn't
tell friend from foe,

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
he was the only person
I could rely on.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
He was a partner I
trusted with my life.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
One day he told me
about his dream.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
One he'd held onto
since childhood.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.662 position:50% align:center
[OMI] He admitted it probably
wasn't attainable,

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
considering the lives we led.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
But he couldn't bring
himself to give up.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
Even got embarrassed as he
talked, which was unlike him.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
He never did tell what
that dream of his was.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
Still, I'll never
forget his smile.

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
Whatever it was,
it brought him happiness.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
It always felt a bit
dismal returning

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
to the same empty house.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:15:00.984 position:50% align:center
So on my way home from school,
I'd visit the dorms instead.

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
Admire them.
Always at the same time,

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
right before dusk. On the
other side of the glass,

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
I'd watch the troupe's dazzling
performance as they rehearsed.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] That was enough for
me. At least, at the time.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
But things changed.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] A girl I'd never
seen before showed up.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
And started talking to me.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
Before I knew it,
she had grabbed my hand

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
and dragged me through
the doors of the dormitory.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
There was a man waiting there.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
With a gentle smile, he asked
if I wanted to watch.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
This time, from inside.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
A little while later I found out
that man was Yukio Tachibana.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
The supervisor of the troupe.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I didn't think
I was interested

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
in getting onstage myself.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
But then, after watching
the troupe rehearsing,

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
and talking to the actors,

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
it slowly dawned on me
how much I loved the idea.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
I realized that was my dream.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
To become an actor
and perform to a crowd.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
The girl who took my hand and
led me in was Yukio's daughter.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd see more of her,
but I was wrong.

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
It turned out she had only been
visiting Tokyo for the week.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
Still, I'll never forget that
day. Or the warmth I felt.

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
[GANG yelling]

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
[OMI] The ones who attacked us
were members of a rival gang.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Nachi!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
It took me months to heal.

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
Got this scar as
a permanent reminder.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
I was the lucky one.

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
Nachi had a bad fall
and died on the spot.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
After I was able to walk again,
I hit the streets,

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
searching for the gang
that attacked us

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
until I found them
and took them out.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
After that, I quit the
Wolves and decided

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
to completely sever
every gang tie I had.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
I quit riding my motorcycle.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:10.030 position:50% align:center
Stopped getting' into fights
and I led a normal life.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
But then, I felt
an emptiness inside.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
Like nothing out there
got me excited.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
Years have passed, but...

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
I still visit my friend's grave
on the anniversary of his death.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
That's where I eventually
met Nachi's parents.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
The last time I'd seen him
was at his funeral,

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
when I couldn't think of
the right the words to say.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:36.639 position:50% align:center
Despite that, they treated me
like I was an old friend.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
They opened up to me
about their son.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
Told me the dream he
had kept secret from me.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
He wanted to act.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
Even back when we
used to hang out,

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
he would go the theater
and watch the performances.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
He wanted to stand
on that stage, too.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
I was devastated.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
He should be here instead of me.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
I survived, some punk
idling his days away

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
without any thought
of the future.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
Nachi actually had aspirations.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
And he was taken before any
of 'em could come true!

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
We needed the money, so...

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:13.218 position:50% align:center
I started working for the
yakuza, doing jobs for them.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
The only reason was to
help my family get by.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
But the lifestyle made
me feel as though

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
I didn't belong in the theater.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
And eventually, I stopped going

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
to watch the rehearsals
all together.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
Still, I attended every
performance they put on.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.026 position:50% align:center
I was audience to
the troupe's plays

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:33.196 position:50% align:center
and their steady decline
over the years.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
I couldn't bear the thought
of it all disappearing...

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
That's why I decided
to give them a loan.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
I didn't care what it took.

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
I wanted Mankai Theater
to make a comeback

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
and keep its doors open.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I always yearned
to be a part of the theater.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
To perform in front
of a captivated crowd.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
It wasn't so long ago

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
that money was the only way

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
I could be involved
with the theater.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to support the
troupe when it needed it

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
the most. What's worse,
I couldn't repay Yukio.

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
To show him I was grateful

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
for all the kindness
he showed me.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
That's it. That's the
biggest regret of my life.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
[OMI] I couldn't let
Nachi's dream die.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
I decide to become
an actor in his place!

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
I hope somehow this'll help him.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
Even if just a little,
wherever he is.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Don't tell Juza, but it
hurts every time I see him.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.301 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
Because his passion to be on
stage is what he lives for.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
He's serious, more serious
about it than any of us.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
And if he knew I became an actor

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
because it was
someone else's dream,

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid of what he'd think.

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
He's so much like Nachi,

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
it scares me to imagine
him hating me.

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
I suppose that's probably why
I'm so nice to him.

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
I wonder if maybe there's more.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
Well, is Nachi the only
reason you're in theater?

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
At first, yeah,
you may have joined

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
for the sake of your friend.
But from what I've seen,

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
you seem to be taking
the craft seriously.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
Maybe, and just hear me out,

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
you actually enjoy
acting as well, Omi.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
You think so?

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
If that's the case.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
Not only was it his dream,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
it turns out we shared
the same passion.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
It's different for all of you.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
You realized your
mistakes early enough,

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
and still had the time
and potential to start over.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
That's all you need
in this life.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
Don't be like me and
make the same mistakes.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
They look perfect. 'Bout time
to pass these out to everyone.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'll help you. Huh?

00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
[OMI] It's fine. You stay
here and eat these.

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, if you insist!

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Director.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
Thank you, seriously.

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't push
yourself too hard.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
But I feel like I almost
have something. Almost.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
In that case, do your best.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:08.703 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] All right. Let's see
how you're all progressing.

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
We'll run through
'em individually.

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:13.500 position:50% align:center
Juza, you start us off.

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
I'm ready.
