[ACTOR A]
Tickets for closing night!

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
Buy 'em while you can!

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR B]
Take a flyer.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
Tickets are still available!
Please come watch!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
So, it's you.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time,
hasn't it?

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you
doing back here?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Winter Troupe's finally up, huh?

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.185 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I didn't have time
to scout for actors,

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.688 position:50% align:center
so I'm not sure if anyone
will show for auditions.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.106 position:50% align:center
Our popularity's on the rise,

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure things
will work out.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:33.403 position:50% align:center
They'll come rushing through
that door at any moment!

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
Mankai Company, right?

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.740 position:50% align:center
How are you guys doing?

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Welcome to the theater--

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.410 position:50% align:center
Cut to the chase,
you here for the auditions?

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah...

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
Cool it!

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
Why are you going
out of your way

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
to try and scare off
prospective new members?

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50% align:center
Really? Look who's talkin'.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
What an awful first impression.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Shut it, porky!

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.923 position:50% align:center
So, you're here for...

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
I don't know if you exude
welcoming energy, either.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Hey. Quit shoving.
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
I'm Azuma Yukishiro.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
As for why I decided to
come and audition today...

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
It was after seeing
those two performing.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.402 position:50% align:center
And handing flyers
out on the street.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
You mean us?

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
Being involved in theater
sounded intriguing,

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
so I figured I'd try it.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
And by any chance do you
have prior acting experience?

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center
Absolutely zero.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] If you do join, you'll
have to juggle time between

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
your regular job and
making rehearsals.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
I'm between jobs at the moment,
so that works out perfectly.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Really? And what kind of work

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
were you doing, if I may ask?

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
I was a professional cuddler--
one of the best.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, a what?

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
Ah. Sorta like nightlife
entertainment, huh?

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
How super mature!

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
Contrary to what you're
all probably imagining,

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
all the job required
was sleeping beside

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
my clients and listening
to their troubles.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
I found the work very wholesome.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. So you're more
like a counselor then.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
Uh, my name is Tsumugi Tsukioka.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
I have some experience.
I mean, when it comes to acting.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
Nothing too significant.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
I've never been
part of a troupe.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
But you have performed
on a stage before, right?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
Yes, only as an amateur
at my school's drama club.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
Also, it's been a while
since I've last acted,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
so you could treat
me as a beginner.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Azuma, go ahead
and start us off.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
Uh... Ad-lib a performance
using my phone.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's me. Yeah. I called
'cause I haven't heard

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
from you in a while.
Just wanted to check in.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
How am I? Doing fine.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:41.573 position:50% align:center
And trying my best. Yeah.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
I understand. Talk to you later.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
Well? Halfway decent?

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
Tsumugi, start
whenever you're ready.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
What's the hold up?

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
Betcha it's too hard for him.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
He's waiting for someone.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
That's all I've got.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
That was amazing!

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
The guy expressed so much
without using a single word.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Like hell he doesn't
know much about acting.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
So, when will we hear back
about the audition results?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
I've got great news.
You're both in!

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI gasps]

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
Congrats on joining the troupe.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
Cheers!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
Glad to have you aboard!

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
Welcome, both of you!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thank you.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
And thanks for taking
a chance on me.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
So, how are we going to
find the remaining three?

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
Not another step!

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
You've got some nerve
setting foot in our territory!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Hey, look.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] Oh shoot, is it a fight?
Should we call the police?

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
No need! We're from Mankai
Company! Please, take one!

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
So, this is a performance?

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
It's way too realistic.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Mm-hm.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
I remember a street punk
like you who would

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
make trouble while hanging
out with that loser gang.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
Let me guess,
you're working for him, huh?

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
[exhales] I'm not.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
Wait up! That's Tachibana's
right-hand man.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
Now you've done it.
Things just got complicated.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
Wow, they're amazing.

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] You over there.
Pretty cowardly of you

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
to go pretendin' you
don't know who I am.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.745 position:50% align:center
About to leave your pals behind
and run off to save yourself.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
You're so gutless, I bet you
couldn't even take a dump!

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
That's it! "You're so gutless,

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
I bet you couldn't even
take a dump"? Love.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
I'm talkin' to you, bastard!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50% align:center
Such a splendid phrase

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
brimming with raffish energy
and, more importantly,

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
one I've not included
in my repertoire, yet...

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, are you
interested in theater?

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
Me? Naturally.
Anything having to do

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
with the arts instantly
seizes my attention.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Then you're in luck.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
We're recruiting new members,
if you'd like to try out.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
Regrettably I have absolutely
no experience with acting.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
But I could try my hand at it.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you serious?

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
Of course. It would be my honor.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
Time for introductions,
I suppose.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
I am Homare Arisugawa.
That's right, the poet.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
You're a what?

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. That's the first
time I've ever met someone

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.129 position:50% align:center
who claimed that
was their profession.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
You're an aspiring poet?

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
Talk about rude!
I have several published works

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
if you would care
to look them up.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
No kidding! What sorta stuff
do you write about?

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
Allow me to recite a few
verses for you. Ahem.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
Overflowing passion,
and gushing emotion,

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
Upon the green roofs of Geneva,
<i>s'il vous plait!</i>

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
O, blue mountain,
my heart tumbles down thy side.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
Both vacillating
and reverberating.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
Like unsteady fingers
caressing a mandolin!

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh, what'd that all mean?

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
I thought you knew everything,
genius. So, explain it.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
Man, nobody could!

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
Thoughts, criticisms?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I found it
very avant-garde!

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
Come on. We're not really gonna
let this clown join, right?

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
But he brings something unique!

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
That's one word for it.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
He's eccentric.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tasuku!

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
You're looking well.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
I feel great! From now on,

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
Mankai Company's gonna be
my new theater family!

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.861 position:50% align:center
I couldn't be happier for you.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] So, uh, I heard you
quit God Troupe, is that true?

00:08:58.997 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Yeah. I'm currently looking

companies in town

They're okay with my
performing as a guest artist,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center

join. Wouldn't surprise me

somehow responsible.

I walked away from them, yeah.

Everybody here knows they love
to play dirty, including you.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
After all, you left them
because you didn't agree

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
with their way of
doing things, right?

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
Quitting was a smart move.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
You see? No one blames you
for what happened.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center

Hurry! Call an

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's a performance?

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
No! This looks too real!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center

Didn't wake up even
after we carried him in.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
That's kinda worrisome.

It was difficult to
rouse sleeping beauty.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure the rules
apply since he's a guy.

Then the sleeping king, perhaps.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Just because the dude's napping
doesn't mean he's royalty.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
It might be smart to call
an ambulance to check on him

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I mean, right?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
If Tasuku doesn't mind,
neither do I.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] So, uh...
How about it, Tasuku?

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
If it makes things easier
for the troupe, I'm down.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're calling
room 204 home for a while.

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
If it's all right
with you, Azuma,

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
looks like you'll have
plenty of space

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
to stretch out in 206.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
A room all to myself?

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
Or if you'd prefer,

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
we can always switch you
with Tsumugi or Tasuku.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.528 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
No, it's fine.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
Might be more relaxing
being completely alone.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
--[door opens]
--[IZUMI] Hm?

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Wait a sec.
Where are you going?

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
How 'bout minding
your own business?

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
Just having to see
your face irritates me.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
Why does it feel like our actors

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
are always working
through something?

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
They're adults!
All mature adults!

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Well, he doesn't
seem to mind all that much.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
Maybe not right now,
but how much longer

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
do you think he can
go on living this way?

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
Sounds like an important topic.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
Just voicing a little concern

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
seeing how Hisoka's side of
the room is completely barren.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
Apparently, his bed doesn't
even have covers on it.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
I don't have any use for sheets.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
You can't keep going on
like this, it's not normal!

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Let's go shopping
and spruce up his room!

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA] Marvelous idea, and
don't worry about the cost.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
Whatever the bill,
I'll be able to cover it.

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
Please allow me
to chip in, as well.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA] We'll need a car
to bring everything back.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
Itaru has a vehicle,

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
but he's sort of preoccupied
at the moment.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
He's in the middle of an
all-day gaming session.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
I'll let you go ahead and
borrow my station wagon.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
But I'm staying behind.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm afraid I'll
end up scratching it.

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Tsumugi. Don't you
have your license?

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
You won't believe this,
but I haven't driven

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.535 position:50% align:center
since training camp
our junior year.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] It's been that long?
Ugh. What about you?

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
I hold a license for
floral arrangements.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
I have my license, but I'm
usually in the passenger seat.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
[sighs] All right, fine.
I'll drive! Let's go.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
You're a lifesaver, Tasuku!

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
And the person we're doing
this for is back asleep.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe
it's already so late.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Well, at least
we got everything he needed.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
Although I don't agree
with how monochrome it is,

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
I view the world through
the full spectrum.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
Complex, not simply
black or white.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
That sounds exhausting.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA laughs]

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Oh dear. I fear my
clever observation

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
may have gone over your head.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
You see, what I
achieved was commentary

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
regarding the nature of décor
and one's world view...

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Stop the car! Pull over! Please!

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
Now, that we’re, ooh--

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into this guy?

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
Hisoka, wait!

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
I wonder if there's something
out here that jogged his memory!

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
I'm coming, too.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll go with them.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, you stay here
and keep Tasuku company.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.698 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI grunting]

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] This whole predicament
has my literary juices tingling.

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
Is being here bringing
back any memories?

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA] I got washed up
on these shores. I think.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
--What?
--Ah, so the mystery deepens.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha, eureka!

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you were a diving
instructor in your past life!

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
Or if that's not it,
maybe you were a stowaway.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
That's the only other
explanation.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.616 position:50% align:center
It'll come back eventually.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
One day, you'll remember
the person you were.

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Be honest,

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
are you serious about
taking up theater again?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna run away
like last time, are you?

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
I don't...

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
Go on, then.

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
This time, I'm staying.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
I don't want to run away.
Those days are over.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Don't forget you said that.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
I won't.
