[FURUICHI]
Looks good.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
My only suggestion
is that you put

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
the 'Day-of-Tickets' part
in a more prominent area.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
Done!

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
How about using
that photo instead?

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
The angle's a little better.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Totally sweet.
Mad props, Omimi!

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.491 position:50% align:center

delicately posting.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
'Diligently,' you mean? I'll
invite as many people as I can.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
Problem is there's no
guarantee if they'll

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
vote for us or
God Troupe, though.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
We preferably want
unbiased viewers.

The more there, the better.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
New space. New audience.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
That's right.

Hm?

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.821 position:50% align:center
Can you perform this scene
out loud for me real quick?

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
I'm making some line adjustments
for closing night.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.079 position:50% align:center
I wanna hear how they sound.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.830 position:50% align:center
All by myself?

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.499 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Well, it'd be better if we had

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
someone to act the other part.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
I'll find Sakuya.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50% align:center
Excellent.

up to now?

We've been prepping
for tomorrow night!

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:39.349 position:50% align:center
Prepping?

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.310 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] It's genius.
Taichi's been giving us

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.813 position:50% align:center
the inside scoop about
God Troupe's theater.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
So, Yuki was thinking...

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
We can add stage effects
that we couldn't use

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.652 position:50% align:center
at Mankai's Theater.

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:53.488 position:50% align:center
Like a triangle!
Got just the one!

Not quite. Think bigger.

Still doesn't
explain why you need

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
all these boxes of feathers.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.330 position:50% align:center
If you really want to help,
shut up and do what I say, hack.

Director?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] So, are you burning
the midnight oil?

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:17.929 position:50% align:center
You know it.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
Just busy watching Tsumugi
and the others rehearse.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
What're you doing
here at this hour?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.436 position:50% align:center
The manager was
practically begging us

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
to make sure we
locked the place up.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.858 position:50% align:center
Not to mention a certain someone
was afraid we'd forgotten to.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:30.692 position:50% align:center
This guy.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
What the--?
When'd I ever say that?

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.739 position:50% align:center
Out of the two of us,
you're the neurotic one!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
How thoughtful. Thank you.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.370 position:50% align:center
Might as well take a look.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Uh. Would you mind
giving them a minute?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
And you call yourselves angels.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
This is your one
chance to give up.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
But instead, you turn down the
opportunity to beg for mercy?

both heaven and earth!

you look a little nervous.

A lot, actually.
But at the same time,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
right now there's no place
I'd rather be.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
That's pretty much the only
thing I can think about.

through your head?

What'd you expect?
I think we can all agree

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
that I'm not a
natural born leader.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
I've struggled with the
role from the beginning.

We're a team, forever.

a real connection to.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
He's never showed that
much expression before.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
[gasps] So, wait,
do you suppose that means

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
he finally got his memory back?

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
But Hisoka did mention backstage

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
that this is where he feels he
belongs. Let's wait for him

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
to bring it up after
the performance is over.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
Thing is... to tell you
the truth, I'm petrified.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
If I screw up out there, the
Company will close its doors.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
This feeling is familiar.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
When I was a child.
And I lost them.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
You're not alone.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
You have us by your side.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
No matter how this turns out,

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
we can bow knowing we
did our absolute best.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
And as a team.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
to be anxious about.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
After all, you have the best
wingmen you could ask for.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
You're right. Thank you!

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
Excuse me, sir.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid visitors
are not allowed

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
on this side of the hospital.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
Oh, forgive me!

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
Do you have some important
business with her?

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
I'm Phillip, her doctor.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell her
something, but...

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I can't
meet with her face to face.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
An odd predicament.
Here's an idea.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Why don't you
write her a letter?

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
A letter. Yes, that's brilliant!
I'll do it right now!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] How's life in
the lower realm, Michael?

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Look, Raphael!
It's amazing, she actually

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
took the time
to reply to my note.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
You don't expect me to
read that from up here.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
Ah, silly me. In that case,
I'll read it aloud for you.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
You certainly seem pleased.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
You do remember my warning
against falling in love

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
with a human. Mind yourself.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Uh. I remember,
but it's not like that.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
My wish-- The one thing I want
is to do something nice for her.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Where's the harm in that?

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
She wrote this letter to you.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
Regrettably,
it'll be the last one

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
that you receive from her.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
What do you mean
by that, doctor?

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
If something happened,
please tell me!

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but...

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
You'll have your answer
after you read the note.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] I'm so relieved. She
has been cured of her illness.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
Also, her and Doctor Phillip
are apparently together now,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
and happy.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's a caring man
who deserves her love.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
Congratulations... [sobs]

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] She's been discharged
from the hospital, Michael.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
And she's engaged now.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
Why continue guarding her. Why?

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Because, despite the good
that has occurred,

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
her name is still
on the registry.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
I wish to continue watching over
her until her very last breath.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
A task that can easily
be done from on high!

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
You have to leave
the realm of Men.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Or soon, there will be
no going back for you.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm able
to stay by her side

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
I know I can endure
anything, Raphael.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Then perish if you must.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
Here comes the ending.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
We've gotten this far.
This is it.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
They'll nail the scene.
I believe in them.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
What did I tell you, Michael?

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
It's too late. You fool.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
Have you come to chastise me
one last time?

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] I'm here to ferry
your soul to the other side.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
Could you at least tell me
if her name's off the registry?

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
That's your concern?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's off the list,
wretched sap.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
Spare me the name-calling,
please, Raphael.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
I wanted to give you my thanks.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
I'm in your care now.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
If only you had listened to me,
you wouldn't be in this mess.

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
The way I see it,
no harm has befallen me.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
But you cannot
return to angelhood.

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
You're simply going to
fade away into nothingness!

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
That may be true.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
But I also have
everything that I wanted.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
My first love is safe

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
and my friend will carry
me away in his arms.

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
What more could a man need?

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
Michael, you utter fool...

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
I will be here.
Beside you. Always.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.358 position:50% align:center
Michael...

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Not only have I lost my love,

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
but also my dearest friend.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
They had me worried.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
Scared me for a sec, too.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
It was almost like the audience
had snuck out of the theater.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
Major lag.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
My heart's pounding in my chest.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
It's amazing.
They won't stop clapping!

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
[applause continues]

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much, everybody!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
From the bottom of our hearts.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
Thank you all.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
We couldn't ask
for a better crowd.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
This show was our privilege.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Your nerves
still bothering you?

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
No. Not nearly as much now.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
That just means
you gave it your all.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
You're right. Now we wait.

We did it!

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
The underlogs have sturdily
shown God Troupe!

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
This calls for a
celebratory triangle!

Stand up, tall and proud.

We won. That means the

You said it.

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
What a shock.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't
know what to say.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
Incredible. I never thought
I'd feel this much joy.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
Let go and allow your
tears to flow freely.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Only if you do.

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Pathetic. Ha!
Look at these grown adults,

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center

Wait, before you go.

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] I almost gave up
on theater all together

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
because of what you said to me

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
after I auditioned,
Mister Kamikizaka.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
Yes and? Your point?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] But it's precisely
because of that experience

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
that I now have everything I
could ever want in my life.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
For that, I'm grateful.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
[RENI] Hmph.
Well, Tachibana's daughter.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.583 position:50% align:center
I concede for the moment,
but mark my words,

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
next time I will crush you.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center

You heard the man!

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
You didn't think you could do
whatever the hell you wanted

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
without paying for it, did ya?

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
Are you threatening me?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
There's no need to
resort to violence, Sakyo!

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Fork over
the money and we won't.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
Money?

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
That's right! You said you'd
transfer all your proceeds

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
if more people
voted for us than you!

[RENI grunts]

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
Oh fine, are you satisfied?

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
I want an itemized report.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
I'll send it later!

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
You're so dependable.

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Hey, Matsukawa.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes?

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
Congrats. You're paid off.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
Paid off as in... Oh.
Lots of zeroes! A whole lot!

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
Debt free! Freedom!
Sweet freedom!

Cheers!

[glasses clink]

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
We did it! The loan is paid off!

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
Get off me.

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
It's about time.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
Congrats to us!

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
Director, I want to
author more plays

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
that would utilize everyone's
different acting skills.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
That'll hone my
abilities to create

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
some really amazing stuff.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
So, if it's okay, I'd like to
keep writing for future seasons!

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
Well, you are Mankai Company's
official playwright, Tsuzuru.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
Let's keep working hard.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
Deal!

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
We only beat God Troupe
by a hair's breadth,

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
so don't dare start getting
complacent on us.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Yeah, I know that!

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
Good news. We finally have
some financial leeway now.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
So, let's aim for
the dream your father

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
wanted Mankai Company
to achieve.

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
The Fleur Award, of course.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
[GUY]
Citronia.

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
Why're you out here?

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.333 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, Director.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:16.378 position:50% align:center
Something the matter?

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:19.464 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
No, no.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:21.841 position:50% align:center
I was thinking about
when it was just me here.

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:23.843 position:50% align:center
Way back when.

00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:24.928 position:50% align:center
I'm happy.

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:28.098 position:50% align:center
To the point I thought I
might cry, so I came outside.

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:29.974 position:50% align:center
This feels like a crazy dream.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.018 position:50% align:center
And it's only just
the beginning!

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.063 position:50% align:center
We've still got the Fleur Award!

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:38.566 position:50% align:center
So, um, I was wondering
about something actually.

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:42.237 position:50% align:center
The word 'fleur.' Isn't that
the French word for 'flower'?

00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:45.865 position:50% align:center
Interesting name
for a theater award.

00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:49.869 position:50% align:center
The name comes from something
that you've experienced before.

00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:53.873 position:50% align:center
Think about it. Every actor
has a bud within them.

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:56.668 position:50% align:center
When they perform,
no matter the role,

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.047 position:50% align:center
they must become that character.
And hold their head high.

00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:04.217 position:50% align:center
It's on stage, where you
see the exact moment

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:06.594 position:50% align:center
an actor fully blooms.

00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:08.972 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] That's where
the name comes from.

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:11.141 position:50% align:center
Correct. The truth is,

00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:14.644 position:50% align:center
I can't think of anything else
that gives me greater joy.

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:19.065 position:50% align:center
I adore watching
each of you blossom.

00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:23.987 position:50% align:center
Keep growing. I want you to
reach your full potential.

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:25.071 position:50% align:center
Same for us!

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:28.616 position:50% align:center
We want to flower on
stage again and again!

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:37.083 position:50% align:center
And you'll be there, to help us
reach our full potential.

00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:43.631 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
We're counting on you!
