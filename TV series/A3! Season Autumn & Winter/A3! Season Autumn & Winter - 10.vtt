00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
Let's hear it.
What do you think of them?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
Well, this is the best group
you've shown me so far.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
They'll do just fine after you
smooth out some rough spots.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
You mean it? That's great news!

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
Just one thing.
You there! Troupe leader!

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Tell me. You gone out
drinkin' together yet?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
Uh... No.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Yeah. Didn't think so.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
I can feel distance
between you guys.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
And it reflects in
your acting, too.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
I second that.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
Do you all want to go out
for a drink tonight?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
I'd be down.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
A drink does stir creativity.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.108 position:50% align:center
Leave this to me.
I know the perfect spot.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
And you'll join us,
right, Director?

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center
You bet! I'd love to.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:47.334 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Ah, now this is
a rather charming bar.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
Something tells me this
is just one of a number

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.838 position:50% align:center
of upscale places
Azuma knows about.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
Super fancy. Like, seriously.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
There.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
What is it? You mean
the dart board?

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA]
Yeah, can we play?

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
Sure. Knock yourselves out.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
Dah! How many times can I lose?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA] Heh. He's already had
a few drinks, too.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
Amazing that he can still
throw with such accuracy.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
Is that guy even human?

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] All right.
We've downed a few rounds.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Played a couple'a
games of darts.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
Do you feel closer
to each other yet?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
Not really sure.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
Having a few drinks
together isn't enough.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
Let's talk about
our personal lives.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Like what?

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
Hm... Maybe relationships.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
Relationships, huh?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
Fine, who's first?

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
Good question. Do you
want to start us off?

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
Why am I first?!

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
I'm definitely curious.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
So how about it.
Are you dating anyone?

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Of course not!

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
All of my attention is focused
on Mankai Company!

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
Heh, just as I expected.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
Tsumugi, you go next.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
I mean...

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
When I was working my
previous job I had a girlfriend,

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
which was also the first time
I was in a relationship.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
What's up? I thought
I mentioned it.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
Well, we weren't really
talking back then.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
So, wait she was your first?

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
I've never been very
popular, you know.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
You two aren't still... Hm...?

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
No, we broke up when I decided
to pursue acting again.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
Just like that.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kinda.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
She was understanding after
we sat down and talked it over.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center
Next is Tasuku.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] Hm... I've had
three serious relationships.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
They were fairly long and were
relatively good experiences.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
You always were the most popular
one. I remember you not being

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
able to hold all your
gifts after the show.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
And I remember you guys
never helping me

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
carry them back to
my dressing room.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
Your admirer's wanted
you to have them.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
They were your
responsibility to move.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
Ah, the struggles
of being adored.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Next up. Mikage.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
Can't remember if I did.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
I figured.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
Then just talk about your
views on love or something.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like do you have a type?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA]
Someone who's independent.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
You're looking for a
partner that's mature?

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Someone who's not too clingy.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
Yep. That makes sense for you.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Your turn, Azuma.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Right. Well, let's see.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
I've had many different trysts,

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
but I'm not sure if I'd
consider any of them lovers.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
It's sorta complicated.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
Huh? Do you mean like...?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA laughs]
I'll only elaborate

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
after I've had a few
more drinks in me.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
Really. I think we're good.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Azuma. No need.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that right?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Last but not least,
we've got Homare.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
I'll pass. I have nothing
to say on the matter.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
As in you've never
been in a relationship?

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
Then you can tell us
what your type is.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
No type.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
So, you don't have any
views on love in general?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
Negative.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
Forget love. I say we start
diving into our fetishes.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
That's crossing the line, Azuma!

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
Eureka! That's it!

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
I can feel a piercing gaze.
A sniper shooting through me.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
Dangerous fragrances and
donning scandalous sunglasses!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
That was unexpected.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
The creative juices
are flowing tonight.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
And this poem means what?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
As it just so happens, lately,
I've felt intense eyes watching,

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
following, and observing me.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
Whose eyes?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
You know. I've felt them, too.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
Same here.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
Then I wonder if
we're being spied on.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
Do you think so?

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
If multiple people feel
they're being watched,

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
we should probably
keep an eye out.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
That was a lotta fun.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
And what a lovely bar, too.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
Yeah. Let's go again sometime.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Absolutely.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hisoka? What's wrong?

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
Nothing at all.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
We finished them.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
When I close my eyes I
see dancing stitches.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
You both look, how to put this?

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
When's the last time
you got any sleep?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Let me know how these fit.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
You're done with the costumes?

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
Can't wait to see them.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
Was it difficult and am I
beyond exhausted, heck yeah.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
But it was definitely
worth the effort.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI laughs]
Oh, wow. They're incredible!

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Agreed. These wings look great.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
Fits just right.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Behold mere mortals,
my angelic beauty!

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
It's my costumes
that are beautiful!

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
And the wing patterns.
Each one is unique.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
I love the detail that went in.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
Wow! You all look so great!

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
Now hand 'em back and I'll
put on the finishing touches.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
Uh. But they look perfect to me.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
I'm going to keep
refining 'til the last minute.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
Taichi? Hope you
don't like sleeping.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
Hey, who needs it?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
Our acting's gotta match
this high standard.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
In other words, nothing about
this show can be half-hearted.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
It's our sacred responsibility
to put on an exquisite

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
production worthy
of these costumes.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
[RENI laughs]
All too easy.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
I'll simply tear their
troupe apart from within.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
We're from the Mankai Company.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
Weirdo.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
You scared that kid
into the next city.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
To be honest it's a huge step up

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center

[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
It'd have to be someone
from my past in order

for them to know I tried
out in the first place.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
Or that I used to work
as a nightlife entertainer.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center

illegal immigrant.

Are you suggesting
someone in the troupe

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
went and leaked our
personal information?

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it, but it
certainly seems to be the case.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA] Uh, by the way.
This may be unrelated,

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center

someone from God Troupe.

I wasn't implying anything.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
Maybe you just happened
to let something slip

cuddly with just anyone,

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.952 position:50% align:center

I would take anyone as a client.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center

our information leaked.

arguing amongst ourselves!

A moment, if I may?

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
I'd like to straighten
a few things out.

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
First, Azuma, you're sensitive

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
because of your
inferiority complex.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
Which stems from your
history as a cuddler.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Homare. That's not
very appropriate.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
Next up, Tasuku. You're
too self-conscious about

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
being a former member
of God Troupe.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
Additionally, that overly
aggressive approach

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
you've adopted is a
defense mechanism,

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
as you're afraid the
blame will land on you.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
And you, Hisoka. You're unable
to defend yourself

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
since you lost your memories.
And so, you remain silent,

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
afraid to say anything that
would arouse suspicion.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
Whereas you still haven't
overcome the trauma

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
of failing your big audition
with God Troupe yet.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
That's why you can't
be assertive or resolve

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center

supposed to be our leader.

you should keep to yourself.

That's what my ex always used
to call me. I have the worst

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
habit of stating what
others are thinking.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center

you can read minds.

No, and I can't control mine.

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
The thought process has
never come easy to me.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
I either tend to think
extremely logically,

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
or go the artistic route.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
Hard as I try, there
is no middle ground.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
When we dated, I always
made my ex cry.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
But I could never understand
what I was doing wrong.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center

Then, what you said earlier...

It effectively ended
today's rehearsal.

address our problems

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
so we could confront them
and move forward.

I'm utterly unable to
empathize with other people.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] If I could have
a moment of your time

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
before we start
rehearsal. Please.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center
You wanted to say something
to the troupe?

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Yes. First things first.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
I want to apologize to
everyone for yesterday.

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
I said some incredibly hurtful
and insensitive things.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I simply wish
to understand

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
each and every
one of you better.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
And to be better understood
by you as well.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
Know this! I love all of you
here in my own unique way!

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasp]

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] What the heck
is he going on about now?

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Heh...
This is why I can't hate him.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
It was Homare's way of caring.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA]
I want marshmallows.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
Not right now, Hisoka!

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
Marshmallows must
take a backseat!

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] Question. Why do you
have a magnifying glass?

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, uh.
My vision has deteriorated

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
as of late and I'm having
difficulty reading the script.

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
[clears throat] That aside,

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
I wish to broach the subject
of the spy in our troupe again.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
I see. So Tsumugi,

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
as our leader, you would
like to abandon the matter

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
so as to avoid it causing
bad feelings in the future.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] That's right.
How did you know that?

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
If we aren't able to completely
trust one another,

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
how can we hope to
ever defeat God Troupe?

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Good point.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
And Tasuku.
You understand why Azuma

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
would suspect you
of being a spy.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Then how about
refraining from any contact

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
with God Troupe until after our
performance is concluded?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
Sound fair?

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
One hundred percent.
Thing is, will it help?

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Don't worry. I'm sure
Azuma will find it satisfactory.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
Works for me.
It's a load off my mind.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
And in exchange, will you
refrain from taking any clients

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
until after the
show finishes its run?

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
I was already on a short break,
but that sounds fair. All right.

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] You can't erase
the fact you're a cuddler.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
And so! Use that past experience
to your advantage.

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's right.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
When it comes to romantic roles,
you've got way more experience.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
Maybe so. I never thought
about it that way before.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
And Hisoka.

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA]
Hm?

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt you're a
major suspicious character!

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
But at the same time,

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
there's nothing you
can do about it either.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
So instead,
invent your own history.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
One that's tailored specifically
for Hisoka Mikage the actor.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
I can write my own story?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
And keep in mind:

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
The more outrageous you make
your origin, the better!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
Be whoever you want! An alien!
A member of a subterranean race!

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
That might deflect the rumors.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
Like, muddy them so much,
no one takes them seriously.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
It could work.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Thus. My look into your
inner depths is concluded.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
I never expected Arisugawa

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
to be the one to clear the air.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You changed
your mind! Tasuku.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
Careful, remember.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
Do not inadvertently
respond to their thoughts.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
Well, then. Seems like we can
put most our issues behind us.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
--[TASUKU] For sure.
--[AZUMA] That we can.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA grunts]

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Okay troupe.
Let's begin rehearsal.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Our performance is
right around the corner!

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Homare.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE]
Hm?

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot for what
you did this morning.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
As the troupe's leader,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
it should've been
my responsibility.

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
But you brought us together.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
Oh, that? Think nothing of it.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
Let's work hard and
put on a great show.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
Yes, let's. We'll do our best.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Well, have a good night, then.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
You, too.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
Someday, I'll be able
to do this on my own.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] A task that can be done
just as easily from on high!

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
Stay in the realm of Man longer,

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
and the way home will close
with no hope of return!

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
Raphael. I can live with that
if she's there beside me.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
Perish if you must, fool!

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Stop there!

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
It's not bad, but Tasuku,

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
try toning down your
intensity a little bit.

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Just some old habits
from my God Troupe days.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.473 position:50% align:center
It's a stark contrast to
the rest of our actors.

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
Which we want to avoid.
Wait a sec!

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
How about it, Tsumugi?

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
Think you can recite
Raphael's lines?

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You want me to?

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and try.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best.

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
A task that can be done
just as easily from on high.

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
Stay in the realm of Man longer,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
and the way home will close
with no hope of return!

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
Perish if you must. You fool!

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Tasuku. Could you
try it again, more like that?

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
I'll give it a go, but that's
a tough act to follow.

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Tsumugi's
always had a talent

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
for subtle performances.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
Just similar in feeling, then.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
You got it. Here we go.

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
Well, it's finally
opening night.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
Now get out there
and break a leg!

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Got it!

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:12.040 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]
