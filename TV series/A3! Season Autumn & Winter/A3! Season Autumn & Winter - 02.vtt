[JUZA growling]

[nervous laughter]

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
Why in the hell do you
keep on following me?

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
This is an all-company
meeting. Right?

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.979 position:50% align:center
There a reason
I shouldn't be here?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
Well, would you mind standing
on the other side of the room?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
I can't stand your breath!

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
You're the one with
the problem, so you move!

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
[BANRI growls]

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
Make me!

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
[BOTH growl]

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Come on, Banny-boy,

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
how 'bout we take a little
stroll over there?

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
Why don't the two of us
hang out in that corner, Juza?

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Is everybody present?
Then let's get started.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
Is something big going down?
Weird vibes, my dude.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
I've called this meeting
to officially announce some

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
ground rules for the dormitory.
Well, Sakoda?

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:03.646 position:50% align:center
Yessir! Ta-da!

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
Cinnamon tea? Fruity jelly?

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
And does that last
one say tempura?

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center
That's simplicity, frugality,
and temperance in calligraphy.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
Starting now,

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
each sub-troupe gets a total
of 20 minutes to shower.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
That's all?
You gotta be kidding me!

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.123 position:50% align:center
Totally not happening.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.792 position:50% align:center
Lights out is at 10 PM.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
And you can bet I'll be
shutting off the breakers.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.630 position:50% align:center
But that's kinda early,
don't you think?

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
So much for my late-night anime.
I hate this.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
Enough crying!

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.763 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Desperate times
call for desperate measures,

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
so do you wanna pay back
the damn loan or what?

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
Unless the Director or Matsukawa
have better ideas, it's final.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
Huh...? Oh. I, uh...
Look, honestly?

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.359 position:50% align:center
The only thing I've been
thinking about is how to

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
get us through all of the Autumn
and Winter Troupe shows

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.279 position:50% align:center
without going broke.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
You're forgetting
the Fleur Award!

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
Oh, it would be a dream!

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.371 position:50% align:center
Ah! The Fleur Award!
Why, they only grant it

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
to the most outstanding play
of the year! Sweet glory!

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
And the sum of the prize money?

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50% align:center
Is ten million yen, baby!

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
Once we secure that bag,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.684 position:50% align:center
It'll erase our debts faster
than you can blink an eye. Ha!

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
I don't need to remind you

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.815 position:50% align:center
it's not an accolade
that's easily earned.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
The original company never
got more than a nomination.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think you're
aiming way too high.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
Still, it's exactly what
we should be aiming for.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
A dream that your father
tried to realize as well.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
We're going to make it happen.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.917 position:50% align:center
So, let's make sure the
Autumn Troupe's show

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
blows the house down!

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]
Yeah!

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
Thanks for coming, everybody.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you how glad
I am to finally start

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
proper rehearsals with you.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
But before we begin,
we need an official leader.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hm? That's a thing?

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Sure is.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
The Spring and Summer
troupes each have one.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
And both their leaders played

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
the main roles for
their debut shows.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
Then it would be practical
for us to follow suit.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
I agree. And based on your

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
overall experience,
age, and qualities,

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
I think you'd make an
ideal candidate, Sakyo.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
Really? I'm afraid I'm
past my prime for that.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
I can assist with
coordinating this group.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center
But nothing more.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
So no, thank you.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
Better to give the role
to someone younger.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
Plus, it would help
them to build character.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
Which would also help the
rest of the Autumn Troupe

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
develop as a result.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I suppose that's fair.
You heard him.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
Do I have any
volunteers interested in

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
helming this group?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
[JUZA grunts]

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Out of the remaining four
contenders, it's obviously me.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
[JUZA grunts]

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hmph.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
Anybody else willing to
step up to the plate?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Hold on.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
Do you understand
the responsibilities

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
that come with this position?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
Nah, I don't have
the slightest clue.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
But I'm confident that
I can do it better

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
than the rest of these wannabes.
And that includes you, too.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
That's fine by me.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
Let's pray you
don't mess this up.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
Mister Leader.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Any objections?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.782 position:50% align:center
I don't have a problem
with that plan.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
Peach keen jelly bean.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Then it's decided,
Banri's the leader.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
And he'll take the
starring role in our cast.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Hey.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
It's painfully clear that Settsu
is the least passionate member

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
when it comes to theater.
Aren't you worried that

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
putting him in charge
might cause some trouble?

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
Actually, I thought it
would be a good opportunity

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
for him to learn.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] If Banri can
take acting seriously,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
it's possible it might
eventually trigger

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
a change of heart for the guy.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
I certainly hope so.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Wait up, Juza.
Let's head to school together.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
Nah, I tend to keep to myself--

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Hey, you two!

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.080 position:50% align:center
I've got plenty of room in back
if you fellas want a ride.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Talk about lucky.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
C'mon, you with me or you
gonna leave me hangin'?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.087 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I already told you I--

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
Quit being a stick in the mud.
Let's buckle up and vamoose.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
Left foot, right foot,
left foot!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
[yawns] So sleepy.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be out
the door by now?

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be late.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hm? Not feelin' it.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
Why? You catch a cold?

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Nah, I usually hang back.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
First two periods
are math and PE.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
You need to get a move-on!

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
[ITARU yawns]
I'm exhausted.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
You good, Itaru? Have you
not been sleeping that well?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50% align:center
[ITARU gasping]

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
I've been overwhelmed lately.

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
You have? What, with work?

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[ITARU] No. With keeping
my <i>War of Warriors </i>rank.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
It's a mobile game.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
There's this annoying
rando called NEO

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
who's been pissing me off.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
I'll need to log on
during my breaks.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
No, wait. I'll dig into
vacation time if I have to!

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
For real? You'd never think

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
a successful working adult
would actually say that.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
I have got to be dreaming.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
Your screen name
isn't Taruchi, is it?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
I'm the NEO you just mentioned.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
I managed to top your rank
for a few minutes yesterday.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
You better be joking.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
I heard you were this
invincible god-tier gamer,

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to try and beat you.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
But man, you proved
to be a pain in the--

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
I was drinking that!

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
You sweaty freaking griefer.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
[ITARU growls]

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
You better ready up.
Because we're doing co-op.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
I need more squadmates
to fill out the rest

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
of my party for the
Hell Mode campaign.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
Heh. Got yourself a deal.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
Uh?! Seems they have
something in common.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
At least, I think.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center

The scene's setting
might not change,

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Copy.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
I've had enough.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
I didn't want this,
but there's no choice. Sakoda!

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
Yessir!

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
Where were you?

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
Here you go, best of luck.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.872 position:50% align:center
[BOTH growling]

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
Hold still unless
you wanna chafe.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasping]

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
There ain't no way
this is gonna end well.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
I'll be holding onto
this for a while.

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
I'm leaving you morons

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
chained together at the wrist.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
You still haven't told us what
the point is to all of this!

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
This supposed to be a sick joke?

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Figure it out for yourselves.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
That's part of the exercise.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
See ya later!

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Dude, cut it out already!

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
You cut it out already!

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
--[BANRI] This way, idiot!
--[JUZA] No, this way!

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. Trouble.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
Didn't I say I'm going to
the kitchen to grab a drink?

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
I gotta use the toilet!

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
You... what?

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
What part of "I'm thirsty"
don't you get?

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
If we don't get to the bathroom,
then we're both in trouble!

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
It's looking pretty rough
for you two. If you want,

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
I could grab you a drink
while you figure all this out.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.937 position:50% align:center
I'd really appreciate that,
thank you.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
Hooray. In that case,

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
I'll help by using the
toilet for both of us!

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second,
that doesn't help me!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
[BOTH growl]

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hmph.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.839 position:50% align:center
This is the freakin' worst.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
Give it a break with
your complaining.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
Quit suckin' your teeth, too,
it's gettin on my nerves!

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.387 position:50% align:center
You're the one who's
getting on my nerves

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
breathing down
my neck like that!

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
Do you know where
your boss is?

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA] I think the big guy
just stepped out.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
Out where?

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA] I'm afraid that's
confidential info.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
Can you say when's
he coming back?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, probably sometime
tonight, I got no idea.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
[JUZA, BANRI]
Tonight?!

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
You guys look as though you're
about to jump somebody.

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
We're waiting for
four-eyes and the key.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
We wanna get these off now.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
There's no point in
wearing these shackles

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
any longer than we have to.

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Uh. Right.
That's understandable.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
What're you up to, Director?

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I'm going grocery shopping.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
Since we're out of milk.
Bye, now.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
Don't kill each other
while I'm gone.

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
Be careful on the way there.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
When are Banri and Juza
gonna get along?

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
Those handcuffs were supposed
to bring them together,

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
but they're obviously driving
them further apart.

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center

[BANRI]
It's the director!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
My bag!

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
Get back here!

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
A little warning next time?!

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
Wait, it's too dangerous
to run around like that!

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
[JUZA, BANRI panting]

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center

[tires squealing]

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
Speed it up,
we're falling behind.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
We can't let the thief get away!

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Stop telling me what to do.
Now shut up and keep running!

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Stop telling me what to do!

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Go high!

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
No, slow down!

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
[BOYS]
Uhhh...

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna get you!

[BOYS]
Uh...

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
Sneaky bastard!

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
Which way did he go?

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
Which way do you think?

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Takin' the shortcut, huh?

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A grunts]

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center

They must've given up!

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center

Up here, jerk!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center

Where's the fire, bro?

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] You really thought
you were gonna

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
give us the slip back there,
didn't you?

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A]
Who-- Who are you guys?

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya want?

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center

[JUZA chuckles]

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
He just clocked ya.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The first punch.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
I guess we have the right
to defend ourselves.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
Guess so.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A gasping]

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
I've been feeling the itch to
take my anger out on somebody.

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
Are we finally on a
similar wavelength?

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
Cause I feel the same!

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A whimpers]

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.462 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A screams]

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.
You're amazing.

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
Are you both all right?

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
We're fine, don't worry.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
You should double check
that everything's in there.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it
more than you know.

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
Whatever, it was no prob.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
And I wasn't gonna let 'em
get away with stealing

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
from my people.

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Huh? Does that mean you think
of me as one of your crew, then?

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
Uh-- I dunno.
Forget I said that.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
And what about you?

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
Did you sustain injuries?

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
A minor scrape, nothing bad.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Go on.
What did you do with the thief?

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
We turned him over
to the authorities.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
Woulda been a pain to
sit through questioning,

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
so we ran straight home.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
Say, when did we get
covered in all this dirt?

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
We must've taken a tumble.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what he said.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[growls] Enough talking.
Hands out.

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:14.774 position:50% align:center
--[JUZA gasps]
--[BANRI] Huh?

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
Well, do you want me to
uncuff you or don't you?

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
Me first!

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
I was about to go nuts!

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It feels great
to be free again!

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
Nothin' like being able
to move your fists.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
I'm happy you get to be
your separate selves.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
This calls for a
celebratory feast tonight.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Yeah! [laughs]

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
Was this your big plan?

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, it seems to have
been fairly successful.

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Hey! So now that we've
finally gotten uncuffed,

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
I need you to stay at
least five meters away.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
Except we're roommates,
so how're we gonna sleep, dummy?

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
That's easy, you can
crash on the sofa!

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Hell no. You can take the sofa!

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
Make me!

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
What a surprise, they're already
at each other's throats.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:56.941 position:50% align:center
Useless punks.

00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
You can't behave yourselves
to save your lives!

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
How have neither of you two
learned a single thing?!

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.119 position:50% align:center
Come here. I'm cuffing you two
for the rest of the week!

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
Give us a break, will ya?

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
Think you're funny?
