They're right.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
I went about this all wrong.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
The quality of the play
isn't determined

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
by my performance alone.

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
This is our show!

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
So, let's improve it by
working hard as a team.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Hell yes.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
Sounds like we've got some final
adjustments to make, then.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
Let's take it from the top.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
What's up?

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
I wanted to say thanks, Tachan.

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
Uh? Fine then,
I'll call you Tsumu.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
I have the cooler
sounding nickname.

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
--Do not.
--[TSUMUGI laughs]

00:21:55.065 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
Let's win this battle tomorrow!

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah!
