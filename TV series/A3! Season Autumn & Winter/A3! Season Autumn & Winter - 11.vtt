â™ª

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
You're a fool, Michael.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
How long do you plan on sitting
there, merely watching?

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
Raphael, you're not
worried about me, are you?

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
Falling in love with a human
will only bring you harm

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
in the end. I know
that all too well.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.080 position:50% align:center
The pain's worth it.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes
to make her happy,

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
regardless of the harm
that befalls me.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] Gracious. Those are
certainly bold words

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
coming from Michael,
the very picture of virtue.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:55.305 position:50% align:center
I see now. You must descend
to the realm of Man.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
You're telling me you
can make that happen?

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
[HISOKA]
The date has been recorded.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
And she is bound for
heavenly departure.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
So, please, cease your protest.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.865 position:50% align:center
Your registry isn't carved
in stone, it's a list.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
Nothing more.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.039 position:50% align:center
She wanted you
to have this letter.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
Regrettably, it'll be the last
one that you receive.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.089 position:50% align:center
Wait did something happen?
Please, doctor. Just tell me.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but you'll have your
answer after you read the note.

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:49.484 position:50% align:center
Michael. It was incorrect
for me to ever call you a fool.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.736 position:50% align:center
Not only have I lost my love,

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
but my dearest friend as well.
You, can't you see?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.633 position:50% align:center
A huge round of applause.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
And it's still going.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.721 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Just goes to show fans
from our previous shows

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center
approve of you.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
Your performance tonight was
much better than rehearsal.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it was the thrill of
the audience that made it so.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50% align:center
We're closer as a group.
Maybe that's why.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.984 position:50% align:center
Let's keep this energy going!

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Mm. Curtain call.
Are you guys ready?

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.197 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Let's go.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] They're so different
from the other troupes.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
It really took me by surprise.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] I felt the same way!
They were amazing!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
--[TASUKU] Really, thank you!
--[AZUMA] You flatter us.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your kind words.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
We appreciate each of
you coming out today.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
Yes, thank you.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
Our troupe is thrilled
you enjoyed the show!

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
Hm...

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
Is this everything
Rurikawa needed us

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
to pick up while we're out?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
I think so. Just gotta swing
by the stationery store

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
to grab Kazu's art supplies
really quickly, and then...

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Getting something new?

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
Yeah. For some reason,
Homare's skin

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
is reacting to the brush
we've been using.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
You can't skimp when
it comes to makeup.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
It completely changes how
our audience perceives us.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
I think this one should work
and it fits within our budget.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
[AZAMI]
Not so fast.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
I overheard you and recommend
getting this brush instead.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
Uh, really?

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
Far better quality,
not to mention

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
more affordable than that one.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
When it comes to stage makeup,
you can't do better.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
I-- Thanks.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
We'll go with this one, then.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing we picked
up some extra supplies.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
We should be stocked up
for a while now.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Tasuku?

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's up, Michael?
Uh! Oh, my mistake.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Accidentally
calling each other by

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
our character names was
bound to happen, I guess.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to
get all embarrassed.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
I'm not! I'm just
usually more careful.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
My brain was busy going over
the play and it just sorta

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
slipped out. By the way,
we're gonna run through

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
the third act when we get back.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
Raphael. You're such
a theater junkie.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're
one to talk.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI laughing]

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
I gotta say,
this really takes me back.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
You remember when we
would spend, like,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
the entire day together
and only talk about acting?

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
Good times, indeed.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
And even though we
were both dead broke,

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
we'd still take trips to
gain new experiences,

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
all for the sake of the theater.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
Remember how rough it was,
sleeping in the jeep?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
For sure. But still, I miss it.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
Same.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
So, you were saying something
about the third act?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
You were curious after all.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
So, I guess I'm not the
only theater junkie here.

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
Shush, would you?
So which scene was it?

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
So how is life in the
lower realm, Michael?

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
Look at this!

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
That lovely girl
actually wrote a reply

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
to the letter I sent her!

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
You don't really expect
me to read that

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
all the way from up
on high, do you?

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
Silly me. I'll read it
aloud for you, then.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY A]
Hey. What's going on?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY B]
A street act?

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY C]
Oh, I love these.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] So, with that line,
I'm thinking you could

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
maybe add a little
more movement.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
Let's try it now,
starting from there.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
I'll read it aloud
for you, then.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
Well, you seem pleased
with yourself.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
Still, you remember
the warning I gave you

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
against falling in love with
a human, don't you?

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
I understand you're concerned.
But I-- All I wish to do...

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--What's wrong?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, which troupe
are you guys from?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh... We're from
Mankai Company!

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
Come to see our
new performance!

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
Winter Troupe, starring in
Sympathy for the Angel!

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] We hope you'll come
and watch the show!

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
[BOTH panting]

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
That was unexpected.

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
Ah. Seemed like the
adjustment worked

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
based on their reaction
though. Wait, crap.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
I was gonna go pick up some
extra clothes for rehearsal.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
I'll join you.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's fine. It shouldn't
take me very long.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
No improvement, I see.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI gasps]

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
After that display,
I'm shocked you're still

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
going through with
the competition.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
[RENI] My first impressions
are always right.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
You're a third-rate
actor without flair,

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
just like when you auditioned.

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
And standing beside Tasuku,


00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
your banal delivery
stands out even more.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.190 position:50% align:center
At best, you're an amateur.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
No shot at becoming
a pro, trust me.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
How utterly humiliating.

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
Failing in front
of all those people.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
I thought you would
have had enough by now.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
You're wrong.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
My acting's good enough
to take on God Troupe.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
My goodness, I was simply trying
to offer some words of advice.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
Fine, go ahead and
embarrass yourself up there,

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
as it certainly makes no
difference to me.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.139 position:50% align:center
Imagine the mortified look on
Tasuku's face afterward, though.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Thank you very much!

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
[HOMARE] How kind of you.
Glad to see you came back.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
Be careful on your way home.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
That was great!

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
Even better than
the last time I saw it!

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
I wish I could watch their
closing show tomorrow night.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
I heard the act-off tickets
were sold by lottery.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN F] Did you notice
Tasuku's acting?

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
It's way different from
when he was in God Troupe.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I thought he'd
give us that charming,

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
princely smile of his.
What a shame.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
That's kind of you to say.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.185 position:50% align:center
I really liked Haruto as
his counterpart better, too.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
What's up?
Is something the matter?

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
No, it's nothing at all.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
Gotta do our best at
tonight's performance.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
Of course, we do.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:05.123 position:50% align:center
I'm Just wondering how we
can make it even better.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] This'll be the final
show at Mankai Theater.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
Let's finish strong.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
Give it your all out there
and finish with zero regrets.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
After that,
closing night will be at

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
God Troupe's theater tomorrow.

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
Performing in the
legendary act-off.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
This will probably
be the last time

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
where we can actually
enjoy ourselves.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
Quite sad when you
put it that way.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
I'll have fun.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
Director, would you mind
if I made some slight changes

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
during the performance?

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
Huh? What kind of changes
are we talking about?

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Just some line deliveries
that'll help improve the show.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
I know it's last minute,
but will you let me try?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
Falling in love with a human
will only harm you in the end.

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:16.903 position:50% align:center
I know that all too well.

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
The pain's worth it!

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes
to make her happy.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
Regardless of what
harm befalls me!

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is descend
to the realm of Man.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
Amazing! You know of a way
I can be among mortals?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
Is this his idea of making
improvements to the play?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
The rules are not
for you to bend

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
at your personal discretion.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
Persist with these sentiments,

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
and I will levy a
sanction upon you.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
Would I dare interfere
with your business?

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
No. I simply wish
to look over her!

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE A] Something about the
Michael character feels off.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE B]
Yeah. Super weird.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50% align:center
Explain! What the hell
happened out there tonight?

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
Easy. Don't incur Yuki's wrath.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] I don't know. What do
you expect me to tell you?

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
Dammit!

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
Frankly, I'm now wondering
if we stand a chance

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
against God Troupe
after tonight's debacle.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
No.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
I think Tsumugi knows
he made a big mistake.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
Instead of dwelling on
this show, let's shift gears

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
and try focusing on closing
night while we have time.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA] Everyone lending a hand
made packing go by super quick.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
This is the last of the props.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA] Hey, hey, hey! Is it
okay if I park on the street?

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
Yeah. There's fine.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
He said right there is fine!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for making
sure the props get there!

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
Tell him 'sweet'!

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
Tasuku.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU grunts]

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
If we don't talk
to Tsumugi soon,

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
he won't have the confidence
to act tomorrow.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
It can't be me, though.

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
I'll just drive him further
into a corner like before.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm? Before?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
He was the same way back then.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
Whenever the two of us
auditioned for God Troupe,

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
and he didn't end up
making the final cut.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Wait up!

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey there. Congrats.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
Um. Hey.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
I wish it could've
been both of us.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
But promise me
you'll do your best.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure thing.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
Well, then. See ya.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] At the time, I knew
there was something off

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
about his behavior. I didn't
have the right words.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
After all, only I
made it through.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
Since whatever I said would
sound like bragging,

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
I decided it would be
best to keep quiet.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
Then Tsumugi quit
theater altogether.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
I regret not talking to him
that day on the bridge.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:33.058 position:50% align:center
What's worse,
I felt so much guilt.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
To hide from it, I blamed
him for quitting theater.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Tasuku. If you regret
not doing anything,

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
don't let yourself make
the same mistake twice.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
You may not be able
to tell the Tsumugi

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
from the past everything
you wanted to say,

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.994 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean you can't
talk to the person he is now.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU panting]

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
I'll be back, but I hafta
run to the dorms!

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Go! Help your friend and we'll
take care of things here.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU panting]

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
Tsumugi?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Sorry. Are you okay?

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
It's not a problem.
I should be the one apologizing.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
I can be such a clumsy
fool sometimes.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
No, you're not. Look,
have you seen Tsumugi?

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
He's gone?

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
I thought he was helping
over at the theater.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
Wherever he is, he hasn't
come back to the dorm.

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
Uh. The bridge.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
Dammit, why won't he answer!

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
I'm making the same mistake.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Hm?

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.657 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
I'm sorry...

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
...for yelling at you earlier.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
It's my fault for changing
the show at the last minute.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] There's something else
I want to apologize for.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
After our audition
with God Troupe,

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
I always regretted
not telling you

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
what was on my mind.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I wanted us
to keep performing together.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
That's why I asked
you to audition.

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
It's not your fault
I wasn't good enough.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
And you're not responsible for
me quitting theater either.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
You have nothing
to apologize for--

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do!

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] There's something I
couldn't bring myself to say

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
back then. I want to say it now.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
You're amazing.
I've always loved your acting.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
Those delicate expressions
I can't replicate.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
How you constantly worked
to perfect your body language,

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
even though it was
already your forte.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
I was always proud
to have a chance

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
to share the stage with you.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Really?

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
So many hours together.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
And I could never come out
and say how I felt to your face.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
Maybe if I had,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
you might have never quit
theater in the first place.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
I hid behind my guilt
and would lash out at you

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
for walking away from acting

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
only because I was
angry with myself.

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
Tasuku...

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
I'm proud to perform beside you.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
Keep up that style of acting.
Please, be yourself.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
The other guys, I'm sure they
feel the exact same way.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
You waited for us?

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
Well, we couldn't do our
last performance without you.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
A minute later, and we were
planning on recasting you.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
We still have time before the
final show, so let's use it.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I was being so selfish.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:45.662 position:50% align:center
I thought my acting was awful
and wanted to improve the show.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
But I totally forgot
what it really takes.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
Believe me. I'm reassessing
my performance.

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
I've always been an
admirer of your method.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
You have a real talent
and should take

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
great pride in how unique it is.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
They're right.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
I went about this all wrong.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
The quality of the play
isn't determined

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
by my performance alone.

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
This is our show!

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
So, let's improve it by
working hard as a team.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Hell yes.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
Sounds like we've got some final
adjustments to make, then.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
Let's take it from the top.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
What's up?

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
I wanted to say thanks, Tachan.

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
Uh? Fine then,
I'll call you Tsumu.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
I have the cooler
sounding nickname.

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
--Do not.
--[TSUMUGI laughs]

00:21:55.065 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
Let's win this battle tomorrow!

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah!
