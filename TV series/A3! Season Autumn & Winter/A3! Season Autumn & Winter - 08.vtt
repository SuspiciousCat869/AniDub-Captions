[TSUMUGI]
You shall bow.

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.637 position:50% align:center
For I am Ya Asktal Gassinger.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
The true supreme emperor
and destroyer of the cosmos!

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
You, emperor of the cosmos?

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe coming from
such an ugly plushie.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.481 position:50% align:center
At the moment, I'm disguising
my true, intimidating form.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
Sadly, I've been
limited to taking on

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
this endearing but lowly one.

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
All powerful, but you
don't have control over

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
--how stupid you look?
--Silence, insolent worm!

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm gonna try something,
so just go along with it.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
I know this is improv and all,

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
but you could've at least
thought of a scenario

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
that was more
grounded in reality.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
Stop complaining
and follow my lead.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
As punishment for
doubting my abilities,

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.545 position:50% align:center
I will now demonstrate
the full extent of my power.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
I can't breathe.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's what I thought.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
Not so doubtful of my
might anymore, are you?

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
Writhe in pain, foul heathen!

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna get you back for this.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI laughs]

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
Hello and welcome.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
If you've made up your mind,
I can take your order.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
One hamburger and
fry combo meal?

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
Just a moment, please.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
So, he works at a
fast food restaurant.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
And he's even got the lazy

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
and unmotivated
mannerisms down to a T.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50% align:center
Thank you, please come again.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
And that slump after
the customer left.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
How incredibly realistic he is.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
Uh. So, was that okay?

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
Um... It was, yeah.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
Kinda surprising that's
your first etude ever.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
Perhaps before his amnesia hit,

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
he may have been
a trained actor.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I don't think so.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
All right, who's up next?

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Homare, you have the floor.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
Is everyone ready?

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
I welcome you!
This is my workshop, friend!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Pray tell, how may
I be of assistance?

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
A poison, you say? Yes.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
He's going for a
fantastical setting.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
Probably feels right
at home for him.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
But selecting one
is not so simple.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50% align:center
I have a variety, as you see.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
A potion designed to
kill you in your sleep.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
Or one that kills you only after
inducing excruciating pain!

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
So, please, specify the
manner of death you prefer.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
And the more details you can
provide me with, the better sir.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
Tell me everything,
I'm all ears.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Okay. You can stop there.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
That was really, really good.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
I'd say you have
a knack for acting.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
Before we end,
I'd like us to choose a leader

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
for the Winter Troupe. In
previous seasons, those selected

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
for the role also served as
the lead actor for their debut.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
As in they'd be the
play's main character?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
That's the tradition.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
First up, is there anyone
who wants to volunteer?

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
Seems like the logical
choice would be

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
selecting an actor
with experience.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
I fully agree.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
The ones here with prior
experience on the stage

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
are Tsumugi and Tasuku.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
If nobody else is interested,
I'd like to volunteer.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
You want the job?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean... If there's
someone who wants the position

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
more than me,
then I'll gladly step aside.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
Make a choice!

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
Just say whether or not
you're gonna do it, idiot!

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU growls]

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center
No pressure. Do you think
you can handle it?

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
So, everyone. How's that sound?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
You won't hear any
complaints out of me.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
I think he's a good choice, too.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] How do you
feel about it, Tasuku?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA]
Hmph. I win.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Wha--? Big sea dragons?

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Pretty sure
you mean big three dragons.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do,
don't give him anymore.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
Dammit. Yakuman again, huh?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
I hope there's no hard feelings.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
Ack, dead broke! My feelings
are the opposite of sturdy.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
Azu "The Master's" first again.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare think of
quitting while you're ahead.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
I say we go for one mortgage!

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
Sure, one more game.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
I was just getting warmed up.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
The sheer beauty of it all!

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
You're really worked up
over their game.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
Everyone's so lively! It's crazy
how much it reminds me

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
of the company's good
old days way back when!

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, I remember
them playing mahjong.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
I didn't participate of course,

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
since I wasn't sure about the
rules of the game back then.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
During the middle ages,
you mean?

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] You think I'm some
sorta vampire?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
Middle ages! Nah,
this would've been

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
years before Miyoshi
came around.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe,
but the history of this company

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
goes back 26 years,
nearly three decades!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
It was the dark ages!

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
And before you ask,

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
neither Matsukawa nor I
were here at that time.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir, this old place
has a colorful past.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
Including unexplained incidents.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
And just what are some of these
mysterious happenings?

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
Kinda like urban legends!
The troupe's got a ton of them!

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. Like that time
we heard strange noises

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
coming from room 203,

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
even though it was
supposed to be totally empty.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
In the end we figured out
it was just Sumi, though.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
But there's plenty of
others besides that one.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
Like the Unopening Door.
The Loupe of Sincerity.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
And the terrifying Torment Doll.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
What is a Torment Doll?

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] As the story goes,
there were once two actors

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
who had a falling out over
an extremely trivial matter.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
When suddenly-- [gulps]

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
--from out of the shadows,

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
a mysterious doll appeared
and cursed them!

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
And as punishment for fighting,

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
it forced them into
an eternal time loop

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
until they forgave one another!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
I'm assuming this is
the point in the story

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
when we're supposed to be
scared stiff or something?

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
Well, uh... Sort of.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
It only wanted them
to be friends again!

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
So, turns it out
it was a good dolly!

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
Great. Tell us about
that Unopening Door.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
There was an incident
a while back

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.726 position:50% align:center
involving an actor
who went missing.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
So, this other actor
went looking for them

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
around the building and
they both got locked

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
inside a room
that never existed.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
Super spooky, right?

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center
Because it's not like
the two of them

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
could have fabricated
the entire story.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
A logical explanation
will always exist.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
Don't forget the
Loupe of Sincerity.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Wait. You were listening?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
There's a special loupe hidden
along with our stage props.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
And its user can see another
person's true feelings.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
The idea of a magnifying glass
revealing one's inner depths

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
is utter poppycock.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
I never imagined you would
be such a sceptic, Homare.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
Merely a realist who doesn't
believe in stories of ghosts

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
and the supernatural.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] Now hold on!
I want an explanation!

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
What do you mean the
deal's off, Mister Yukishiro?

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
Do I need to spell it out
for you? It's over, all of it.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
I'm no longer interested in
doing business, that's that.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
Hey. They've started.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Yep. Lookin' forward to it.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm begging you!

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Hear out my proposal,
just one more time!

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
The matter's not up
for discussion.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
You should let it go.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's it. Azuma's
grown much better at reacting.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO] Tasuku? No way.
I thought that was you.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
Haruto.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
You're with them?
Seriously, Mankai Company?

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
You really did hit rock bottom!

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
Now wait just a minute!

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.439 position:50% align:center
And to think you were our lead.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, we found someone
more deserving of the role.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
You wanna guess?

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
Yeah, your name in lights.
Genta Yamada.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
Yamada?

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
His true ID.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
I swear, you better
shut your trap now!

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
Keep on screwing around with me,
I will end you, pretty boy!

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
Careful Genta, you're
falling out of character.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
I said shut up!
And the name's Haruto!

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
That's enough.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
No reason to go
and cause a scene

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the street.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
Reni.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:06.106 position:50% align:center
[RENI] The New Winter Troupe,
eh? And fully assembled.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
We have you to thank.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
Long time no see.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
Based on all the familiar faces,
it would seem Mankai

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
has a penchant for stealing
from our actor pool.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
We haven't stolen anybody!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
You're already aware
that Tasuku and Taichi

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
wanted to join
the troupe willingly.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
So don't try and paint us
as the bad guys!

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
What a spirited general
director you are.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, we still
demand compensation.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
It's decided. Mankai Company,
we challenge you to an act-off.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
Tell me that you're joking!

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO laughs]

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
What precisely is an 'act-off'?

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
A competition between
theater troupes.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
After both companies
put on their show,

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
the audience votes for which one
had the better performance.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
The stakes? Let's hear
what happens to the loser.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
Yes, about that. If we lose,

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
we'll transfer all our proceeds
from the next performance

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
to your pathetic little company.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
All your proceeds?

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
Oh, I'm not finished.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
In the likely event
that you lose,

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
Mankai Company will disband.
For good.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
So not exactly
a friendly competition.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous!

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
There's no legitimate reason
we should agree to this.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
Oh? You sure about that?

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] He just said God
Troupe and Mankai Company

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
are gonna have an act-off!

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
Did they say the loser disbands?

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50% align:center
This, I've gotta see!

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't recommend
declining our challenge.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
Or else people
might start talking

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
about how you were so
intimidated by our talent,

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
you turned tail
rather than take us on.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
Now it makes sense. Why he
brought this up in public.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
You're right.
They had this all planned out.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
Still, I'll be generous and give
you a week to reach a decision.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
I suggest using that time
to carefully mull it over.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
An act-off with God Troupe.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Well, you gotta admit,
it was pretty gutsy of 'em.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
True. As for the proceeds
from their show,

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
how much are we talking about?

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
Loads. Ten million yen,
at least.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
Ten million?!

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha! We-- We could repay
our loan and have leftovers!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
Just when all hope seemed lost,

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
the god of theater appeared
and smiled down on us!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center
Back up. If we lose,
we'll have to disband.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
The deal sounds too risky.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
But if we can't afford
to make our payments,

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
we'll have to disband anyway.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.722 position:50% align:center
See? Even more reason!

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
When you look at it that way,
we should definitely go for it!

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
Frankly, the way
things are looking

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
with our current
budget projection,

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
it will be hard to pay on time.

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
Basically, what
you're saying is...

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
We never really had much of
a choice to begin with, huh?

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
Regardless, Winter Troupe
ought to be the ones

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
to decide whether
or not we'll take part.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
You have our wholehearted
support if you decide to accept!

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
This affects the entire company,
so we'll have your back.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to see this place
hafta close up shop.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
Well? Yes or no?

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.550 position:50% align:center
I think we should.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
The thing is,
it's a tough choice.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
Aren't you our leader?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
Now is the time to
stand your ground!

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
Then again,
there's no need to rush.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
We've got a week before we
need to give a definite reply.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
Think it over carefully.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
You're already up?

00:13:55.085 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
Of course.
Make sure you're not late.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
They decide yet?
The deadline's coming up soon.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that.
You know the way Tsumugi is.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
And Tasuku seems
as irritable as ever.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
Not exactly the right time
to discuss things.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Someone has to make a decision.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
We need to give an answer by
the 13th, which is tomorrow.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
It's down to the wire.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
I'll figure something out
by the end of the day.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
I know how recent events
have been weighing on you.

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
So, I took it upon myself
to write a poem

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
for these trying times.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Huh?

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
Shall I begin?

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
A montage, faraway.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.837 position:50% align:center
And an endless décantage.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
The faded memories
of one's youth.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
Disappearance of theories.
Those accumulated calories!

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
So, how was it?

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
Well, um...
I thought it was, uh...

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
Another truly unique
poem, Homare.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
And the imagery, so engaging.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
Well naturally. Now it's yours.

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
Whenever you're feeling down,
remember my words

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
and they'll soothe
your troubled mind.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I don't know
how to repay you.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Hisoka. It's time
for morning rehearsal.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:21.421 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I can remedy
this sad situation.

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Marshmallows?

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
Huzzah!

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
He ate it.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
And back asleep.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
The drawback is the effect
wears off after a few seconds.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need a much bigger
bag to get through practice!

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
[AZUMA laughs]

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:58.083 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It's pretty
entertaining.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should sell tickets.

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
You done feeding the wildlife?

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
Stand up. Time to
get started. Move.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
You know, corralling everybody
was supposed to be your job.

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] All right. That's it
for today's rehearsal.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
Now that we're done,

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
I'd like to discuss the proposed
act-off with God Troupe.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.786 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
What're everyone's thoughts?

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
Let's start off
with you, Tsumugi.

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
The way I see it, it's worth
accepting their challenge.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
If we come out on top,
we can repay the loan.

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
But there's one part I'm not
entirely confident about.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
Winning with me
in the lead role.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
So instead, I think
it should be Tasuku.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You're dumping
the responsibility

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
you accepted on me?

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
But I'm nowhere near
as talented as you.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center
Dude! How long are you gonna
let the past drag you down?

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
Let him go!

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
There's no point in fighting.
It's so gauche.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
You must really love quitting

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
and leaving people
out to dry, don't you?

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
I should've known better
than agree to perform

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
with someone as
unreliable as you!

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
Tasuku.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
It would appear we should save

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
this discussion
for a later time.

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
No need.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
I'll tell God Troupe
we're declining the act-off.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
I should have been the one who
decided that from the beginning.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
It was wrong to place the
burden on your shoulders.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, I think
it's better this way.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
I agree. Put this behind
you and move on.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
You want one?

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI]
Uh. Thanks for offering.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I am the
person at fault here.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
By not having enough confidence.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
I'm no leader.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
Poor Tsumugi.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
[door clicks]

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
Tasuku, how did
things get so bad?

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
What I wouldn't give,
for us to be friends again.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
A plushie? But from where?

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
He's kinda cute.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
He's kinda cute.

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
Kinda ugly.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
I said cute!

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
We're really gonna
fight over this?

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
Cute times a million,
and that's final!

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
It's ugly!

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
If I had just one wish...

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
It'd be for us to
talk like old times.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Up already?

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU] Of course.
Make sure you're not late.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
Like I thought, he's still
angry about the other day.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
I know how recent events
have been weighing on you.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
So, I took it upon myself
to write a poem

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
for these trying times.

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
Not another one.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
As a poet, writing
beautiful compositions

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.847 position:50% align:center
is an essential act,
similar to breathing.

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
Now allow me to present
my latest masterpiece.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
Shall I begin?
A montage, faraway.

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
And an endless décantage.

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
The faded memories
of one's youth--

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
We heard this
craziness yesterday!

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but I composed
it just this morning!

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
As in today?

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
Another truly unique
poem, Homare.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
And the imagery, so engaging.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
Well, naturally.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
Do you two have amnesia, too?

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
You're acting senile.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
What is this you speak of?

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
My mind is as clear as a
mountain stream, 24 hours a day.

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
Heh. It's pretty entertaining.

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should sell tickets.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
This is the same
as yesterday, too!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
Listen, you've been
making zero sense today.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
He's kinda right.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
I think you're just
having a case of déjà vu.

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
A major one.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
No, that's impossible.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
Maybe if it were just me,

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
but we're both experiencing
it and at the same time.

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Hey Tasuku, check it out!

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
Huh? Yeah, okay?

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
[TSUMUGI] Look at the date!
It says November 12th!

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
Today is Saturday,
November the 12th.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
And this is your morning
news for the weekend...

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
If this is a prank,

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
it would've taken some
elaborate planning to pull off.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm still not buying it.

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] All right. That's it
for today's rehearsal.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
This is nuts.
We're reliving the same day.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Now that we're done,

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
I'd like to discuss the proposed
act-off with God Troupe.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
What're everyone's thoughts?

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
Let's start off
with you, Tsumugi.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
My answer is the
same as yesterday.

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
Uh. I think...
that we should...

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
Enough of this!

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.671 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter how many
times we repeat this,

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
I'm not performing with
someone I can't trust!

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
Ah... [laughs]

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
How lucky am I,
finding a new triangle!

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50% align:center
When we wake up, do you
think it'll be the 13th?

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.951 position:50% align:center
Well, it better be.
