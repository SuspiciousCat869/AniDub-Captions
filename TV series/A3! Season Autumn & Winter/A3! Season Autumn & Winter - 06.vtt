00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.932 position:50% align:center
I'm Banri Settsu.
Here's my portrait.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Above anything else,

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.944 position:50% align:center
I've always needed something
that would make me feel a rush.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.780 position:50% align:center
Whether it was sports, school,
fighting, or whatever.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
I could beat anyone
at anything without

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
exuding the slightest effort.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.787 position:50% align:center
My life felt empty,
completely dry.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.791 position:50% align:center
I did all sorts of things
to quench my undying thirst.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
I didn't care what it took.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.628 position:50% align:center
I flirted with crime
and put my life

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
at great risk just
to feel something.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.591 position:50% align:center
My existence was
set to easy mode.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.261 position:50% align:center
I couldn't wrap my head around
why others had to struggle.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.471 position:50% align:center
So desperately.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
Why're they trying so hard?

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
And why doesn't it
come easy for them, too?

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
Around that time, word reached
me about Juza Hyodo.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.983 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:33.236 position:50% align:center
'I'm gonna hunt the dude down.'
That's all I said to the guys

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
I was hanging out with.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
But I didn't know
what I was getting into.

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50% align:center
When I found someone
who fit his description,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
I walked up to throw
a punch at him--

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
when I suddenly found myself
face down on the ground.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
Never before has anyone
had the upper hand on me.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
I had no idea what
the hell was going on.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
Then he walked off.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
Slowly stalked away without
even a second glance back at me.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
That was the first
time I ever lost.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
In all my 17 years, only
he held a victory over me.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
Since then, day and night,
all I ever thought about

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50% align:center
was how much I could defeat him.
I'd never lose again.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
When I stood before
him a second time,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
he casually turned his
back on me and said:

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
"There's no point in fightin'
someone without ambition,"

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
then he walked away again.
Leaving me behind to gawk.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
I keep trying to
provoke him after that,

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
but it always ended the same.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center
I was trying to fight someone
who wouldn't fight back.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
It was honestly driving me
a little crazy.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.887 position:50% align:center
"I won't let him quit!
Not while he's ahead of me.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
I don't know how,
but I have to beat him

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
at some challenge!"

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
I ran into him again.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
Of all places, I saw him
enter a shabby theater.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
Him, having any interest
in the arts, get real.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
Still, I followed him inside.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
And when I peered
into the theater,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
I saw him auditioning.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
For me, my single
biggest regret in life...

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hey, I know you're awake.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Tomorrow's closing
night. Who can sleep?

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Just try to.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Like you weren't awake, either.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Yeah, 'cause you woke me up.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Uh-huh, ya liar.
You snore as loud as a train.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
I can tell when
you're unconscious.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Yeah, well at least
I don't talk in my sleep.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
I don't talk in my sleep.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Last night, you were
repeating some girl's name.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
No, I wasn't!

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Stop yelling. You tryin'
to wake the whole dorm?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
Banri.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
Now what?
Thought you were tired.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
About your performance
earlier. It was good.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
Damn right it was. Still,
doesn't feel like I've won yet.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
Took a while,
but I found something

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
challenging in my life.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Turns out, it's all
your fault, idiot.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
Just between us,
and I mean this.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
No one gets me worked up as you.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Hope you're ready, 'cause I'm
defeating you tomorrow night.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
[JUZA snoring]

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Am I boring you?

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
[TASUKU]
Nanao?

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tasuku?

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
Strange, I thought you
were with God Troupe.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
So why are you performing here?

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
Uh. Thing is...

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
We came out to watch the final
performance. Should be good.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the support.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
You certainly know your
role don't you, Taichi?

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
Yeah, about that...

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.071 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
What's the deal?

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
This the guy?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Banny and Juza?
These are my...

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
Why, hello there.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
enjoying your little show.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
Should be a memorable finale.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
Spare us the bad acting.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
We all know about what
you tried forcing him into.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.294 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
That's right, and from now on,

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
Taichi performs on
stage as one of us.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Is that the truth?

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm not going back!

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
[RENI gasps]

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
Don't ever bother him again,
you hear me?

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
And you better be on your
best behavior tonight, or else.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
You're letting him go?

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
He was nothing but a pawn.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
So that's what happened.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
You forced Nanao to
infiltrate this troupe?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
Answer me, Reni!

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
What's the big deal?
Calm down.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
Then, you knew about it, too?

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
I've had enough of you
and your pathetic scheming.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
I quit God Troupe, too!

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't dare.
Have you forgotten how I

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
personally trained you
to be our featured actor?

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
And for that,
you have my gratitude.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
But I won't work for someone

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
who doesn't respect
his fellow artists.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
Tasuku! Stop right there!

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
He just walked away from the
opportunity of a lifetime.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
What an idiot.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
What you said... back there.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
Save the tears for later.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
You're gonna ruin
your makeup. Let's go

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
Come on, the curtain's up soon.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Yeah! The last
time the Autumn Troupe

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
performs on stage together.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.424 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI laughs]

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Good evening and welcome
to the Mankai Company.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
Tonight will be the final
performance of

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
<i>The Roman Episode </i>performed
by the Autumn Troupe.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
Once again, the performance
will begin shortly.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Please take your seats
and enjoy the show.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
Let's see. I'm seat F-five...

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
Oh? That would mean
you're sitting by me.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks. Ha, ha.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Thank you for your patience.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
Without further delay, I present
the final performance

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
of <i>The Roman Episode </i>by
the New Autumn Troupe!

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.885 position:50% align:center
This is it! We're on!

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
[JUZA grunts]

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center

[TAICHI grunts]

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.771 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Well, boss, whaddya got for me?

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
Luciano. And Lansky. You two're
gonna work together on this.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
Outta the question.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
You took the words right
outta my mouth, buddy!

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
Why do I gotta team up with
Cheapskate Lansky over here?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
What if poverty's contagious?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Speak for yourself!

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't touch you
with a ten-foot pole!

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
I might turn into an asshole!

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
Make mine a 20-footer!

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I want both of you
to man up and get the work done!

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] You got it, boss.
Move it, we don't got all day.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
And who put you in charge?

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
You and I still gotta
out-act them, remember?

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50% align:center
Man, this sucks.
It's your mess. So, fix it.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
This is not my problem.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
You wanna explain
how it's not, moron?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
Soon as they find out
the goods got stolen,

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
our heads are gonna roll!

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
Show everyone what
Autumn Troupe's made of.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Hold up, Luciano. We need
to tread carefully into--

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
Okay assholes, hand over
the goods nice and easy!

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
Or I'm gonna become
your worst nightmare!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
Whenever I'm doing the talkin',
you listen dammit.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
Ah, shut it, broke ass.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Any idea how we're
getting out of this alive?

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
I've got us covered.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
Nice one, Lansky!

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
You know if I'm
bringing up the rear,

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
your life is in good hands,
guaranteed.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Gotta admit, you're damn good.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
Now if only you could learn
to shut that mouth of yours.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hmph.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:47.355 position:50% align:center
That was great! Really!
Your best performances yet!

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
[BOTH panting]

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Impressive work.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Catch your breath, guys.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Right.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Idiot. You got too carried away.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but the
audience loved it.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah, they did.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
[OMI] The guys from God Troupe
are out in the crowd.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
Show 'em what you're made of.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
But not just to prove
myself to my old troupe.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
I will give the audience
my absolute best!

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
You're my brother's
friend. Cool.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
My name's Benjamin.
Nice to meet you!

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Likewise. The name's Luciano.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
Man, come on.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
Ain't no way you're
related to Lanksy here.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
Last time I checked he and I had
the same mother and father.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
So, watch your damn mouth
before I sock it.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI laughs]

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
--[coughing]
--Whoa, are you all right?

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
I'll get your meds.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
Most of the time, I have
to stay inside the house.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
But... I really hope you'll
visit me again at some point.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Never knew
he could act that well.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
I hope my brother
isn't overworking himself.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
Hard to say, kiddo.

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
He seems pretty fine
to me when we're out.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
I'm always asking him
about his job,

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
but he never tells me anything.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to think
of him burning out.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
To pay for my operation.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
Operation?

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. It's such
a major procedure.

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
The doctors aren't
sure how it'll turn out.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
But if everything goes right,

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to live like
everybody else does!

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
Well, ain't that swell?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
One thing. The operation is
gonna be super expensive.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
But every time I bring it up to
my brother, he snaps at me.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
You don't have to worry, kid.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
Lansky pinches every
penny he can get.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
Just focus on coming out
the operation okay.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
All right.
I think I can do that!

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
So, you and Lansky. I hear
you're hittin' it off okay.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
Who would've thought?

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
You made exactly
the right call, boss.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
Just a word to the wise, though.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't put too
much faith in the guy.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean, boss?

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
Stop and think about it.
Look. You're a simple guy.

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
But keep your eyes closed,
and simple is all you'll be.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
Did Sakyo ad-lib just now?

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
It's like he's talking
to Banri about his past.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
Where'd that come from?
Still, point taken.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
We appreciate you
working with us, Lansky.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
But do yourself a favor
and remember one thing.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
Don't ever assume
you can tell the mob

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
or the cops what to do.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
I know, I'm just a lackey
and always will be.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
Best you keep
telling yourself that.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, remind me,
you got kid a brother

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
who's really ill, right?

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
His operation should
be coming up soon.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
My brother's not involved!

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Hey, I'm hoping
everything goes well.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
Then again,
that all depends on you.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
Dammit.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Luciano, I would've
never taken you for a traitor.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
There's no loyalty
in this world.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
You gotta believe me, boss!
I would never betray you--

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
Lansky's got the evidence,
so don't bother.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
You're not talkin'
your way out of this.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
Wait. Lansky's the narc?

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
You can't say I didn't warn you,
Luciano. Remember?

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
Keep your eyes closed,
and simple is all you'll be.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
Dammit! Lansky!

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Lansky. I guess
there's nothing's off the table

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
as long as it's
for your brother!

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
You no good, lying sack of shit!

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
You knew exactly who I was
the day we partnered up.

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
Some jerk out to make a buck.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you!
You had me fooled!

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
Here I was thinking
you were a standup guy!

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
Well, you had me figured wrong.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
But then again, thinking isn't
your strongest suit, is it?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
You wanna see strength?
Untie me!

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
Do it yourself, then we'll talk.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
You're dead meat! Dead!

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
[GANG MEMBER A]
Boss! Luciano got away!

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
Where is Lansky?

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
[GANG MEMBER A]
Uh, actually,

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able
to reach him either.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
And something tells me
you won't.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
But no surprises there.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
Pairing those two together
was my idea from the start.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
Well, looks like my tip
paid off after all.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Listen to him, ad-libbing again.

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
[JUZA]
He's pretty good.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.642 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting that geezer
upstage me, though.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's my line.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable. I've had it.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
I don't want to hear another
word out of your mouth again.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
You can hit me if you want.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
Oh, you bet your ass
I'm going to!

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
You seeing how amped up
those two are?

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and its thanks to Sakyo.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Hmph.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
Look, I'll pay you restitution!

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
Huh? You think money is gonna
solve my problems and...

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
What did you say?
You're gonna give me money?

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
The guy who debates
for at least an hour

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
before spending a buck
is offering to pay me?

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
After what I owe you,
it's the least I can do.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
--You've cracked.
--Heh.

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd see the day.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
The penny-pincher's
offering me charity!

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Lansky's gonna cough up money!

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
Damn do, my sides hurt!
I'm gonna die laughin'!

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
What's funny 'bout that?

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
Quick. Better clench your teeth!

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
[BANRI grunts]

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
Ah, what the hell.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
How about we just call it even?

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! That punch
looked totally legit!

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
Here, Take it.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
What're we gonna do now?

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
[JUZA] Dunno, but I've gotta
keep supporting my brother.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
And thanks to you,
I'm out of a job.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
Should we start a biz?
Sell ourselves as bodyguards?

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
If that doesn't work, spies.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
You'll never learn.
Well... Whatever works.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
We can be jacks-of-all-trades.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Hardly sounds like a plan.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
Although, it's not half bad.
Should be interesting, at least.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
For me, my single
biggest regret in life...

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
Living in ignorance,
and being convinced everything

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
around me was
either stupid or boring.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
That's what I regret the most.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
Nothing to get me worked up
over? To hell with that!

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
There is something
that gives me a jolt!

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
That excites me.
And it's right here!

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
Finally won.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
Feels good.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
I meant me!

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
I won.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
Son of a--!

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
Respect the stage,
or get the cane.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
Well, time for curtain call

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
Let's go. Guys? Ready?

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
[JUZA, BANRI]
Yeah.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
--Thank you!
--Thank you!

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
Thank you, everybody!

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
Thank you, truly!

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sincerely.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Good job, you guys!

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
Not bad.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
What a final performance!

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
It was so much fun!

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
For sure! And those action
scenes were super legit!

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
That means a lot, guys.

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks.

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
Oh man, Jyuchan,
you were so cool up there!

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
Muku.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.964 position:50% align:center
"Jyuchan"? When did you
two become best buds?

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
I-I'm sorry.
It just slipped out!

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
My brain's a lotus root, porous
as freeze-dried bean curds!

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.848 position:50% align:center
Starting to think those two
go way back.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
It's cool. Muku's my cousin.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
You serious? Why'd you
keep it a big secret?

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
'Cause I knew what
kinda reputation I had.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
I didn't want people
to think less of him

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
knowing we were related.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
They even think the same way.
Of course they're related.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
But I'm proud to be
Juchan's cousin.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
There you go with that
'Juchan' business.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
Call me whatever, cuz.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
You mean it? What a relief.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI] Uh, Yuki.
If you've got a second,

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
I really need to
apologize to you.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
Because I'm the one that
destroyed the costumes.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry!

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
I know, but he did have his
reasons. God Troupe forced--

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
It's my fault. I won't
make any excuse!

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything
to make up for it!

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
Whatever punishment
you come up with!

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
A punch seems fitting enough.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grunts]

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
What's this?

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
I'll let you borrow it.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
You'd better
practice blind stitching.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
'Cause I plan to
work you to the bone

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
making costumes this winter.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI]
Huh?

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Bark if you understand,
dumb dog!

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
Woof!

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.173 position:50% align:center
One loyal dog.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Tenny!

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
I'm listening.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
Someday, I promise... my acting
chops are gonna surpass yours!

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
When they do, you let me know.

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
[TAICHI laughs]

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
Nice work.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
A little present.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
What's up?

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
You're reward is doing a
Hell Tower campaign with me.

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
Come on, dude!
I just finished my show!

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
That's a couple of true gamers.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
[RENI] Now that Tasuku's gone,
you'll take his place.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.662 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
I'm honored.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
God Troupe is going to challenge
Mankai Company to a little

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
act-off to prove who's the best.

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
We'll crush their pathetic
troupe in front of everyone.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
A public execution of sorts.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
Our success depends
entirely upon you.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
Can I count on you?

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
You bet. I won't let
you down like Tasuku.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
What are you spacing out for?

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
Remember when the Spring Troupe
had finished up their run?

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
Way back. I remember you
looking incredibly smug

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
for having one performance
under your belt.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.954 position:50% align:center
And you were a debt
collector back then.

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I still
find it kinda surreal

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
that you're a member
of the company now.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] When I thought time
had frozen for me,

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
you forced me
to take the step forward.

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
Don't think I'm not
holding you responsible

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
for doing this to me.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.635 position:50% align:center
Good. I won't make
you regret it!

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Cheeky 'lil brat.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
Hey, would you knock it off!

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
There was time
you used to like it.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.726 position:50% align:center
Yeah, a long time ago!

00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
Well, still... Doesn't
matter how old I get.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
I guess you'll always think
of me as that little girl.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
At the risk of you laughing--

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
would you believe
that little girl

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
was actually my first love?

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.614 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] You couldn't tell
I was acting just then?

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
You're such a gullible
third-rate director.

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
Next up is the Winter Troupe.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:10.914 position:50% align:center
As our general director,

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
you're gonna have your
work cut out for you.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:15.877 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Right!
