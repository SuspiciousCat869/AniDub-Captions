00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:11.270 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey... listen...

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.506 position:7% line:83% align:start
Listen! I know this is sudden,
but I love you!

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:18.375 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Will you please go out
with me!

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.175 position:19% line:89% align:start
I yeah... I-I'm sorry.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:25.478 position:13% line:77% align:start
This must be awkward. You
probably don't know what to say,
huh?

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:30.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I-I just couldn't keep it
to myself any longer...

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.116 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh, well I...

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:35.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
Y-yes?

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.853 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well I'm flattered. I know I've
eating lunch with you and Kyou a
lot these past few weeks,

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:45.688 position:5% line:77% align:start
but I still feel like we haven't
had time to get to know each
other very well.

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:48.957 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I guess that's true,
isn't it?

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:52.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh, it's not that
I dislike you or anything.

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:56.994 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just didn't see you as like,
a romantic interest.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:00.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, wait, that sounds kind
of rude, doesn't it?

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.363 position:13% line:89% align:start
I didn't mean it that way.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.599 position:10% line:83% align:start
But uh, I guess if you like,
we could try going out?

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.333 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.468 position:7% line:77% align:start
I mean, like I said before, we
haven't known each other for all
that long.

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:17.337 position:5% line:77% align:start
But in a way that just gives us
more time to work things out
together.

00:01:17.337 --> 00:01:22.141 position:13% line:71% align:start
It might not be so bad if
wetried doing that as a couple
instead of just plain old
friends.

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.075 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then... do you mean...?

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:27.709 position:7% line:83% align:start
Starting now, we're boyfriend
and girlfriend... That okay?

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:30.711 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:32.945 position:27% line:89% align:start
W-what's wrong?

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:34.780 position:33% line:89% align:start
I-I'm sorry.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.781 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't help it.

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:42.650 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's like a dream come true...
I'm so happy... Thank you.

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:45.651 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Thank you.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Wow. I didn't know you
wanted to go to nursing school.

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.070 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Uh huh. It's been my
dream ever since I was little.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.872 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] That must be nice. I
can't say I've given the future
much thought myself.

00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:34.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou] Well I... There's no need
to rush.

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:35.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I don't know
about that.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.775 position:10% line:83% align:start
If all I did was sit around
and do nothing,

00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:40.309 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think you might be a little
dissapointed in me.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.077 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] That's not true at all!

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:45.712 position:10% line:83% align:start
No matter what happens, I'll
never be dissapointed in you.

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:48.114 position:7% line:83% align:start
You don't have to do anything
but be yourself!

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:50.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Thank you. [Ryou] Huh?

00:03:50.247 --> 00:03:53.149 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No one's ever told me
something like that before...

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.551 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know. I'm kind of
touched. It means a lot to me.

00:03:59.185 --> 00:04:00.953 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] It's nothing...

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.458 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kyou!

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:21.463 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] What are you doing?
It's Sunday, isn't it?

00:04:21.463 --> 00:04:23.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
You should be with Ryou
right now.

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You're so nosey.
It's none of your business.

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:30.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Yeah, you're
right. Sorry.

00:04:30.068 --> 00:04:35.003 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Huh? No, I uh...

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:36.971 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] By the way...

00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:41.140 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't know what she said, but
she's had a crush on you since
our junior year.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.573 position:33% line:89% align:start
Really? Wow.

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:45.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, are you getting along okay?

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.210 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, pretty well.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's sweet and hard working...
But also kind of shy,

00:04:49.844 --> 00:04:52.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I have to be careful
of that sometimes.

00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:57.014 position:10% line:77% align:start
Yup! That's her! But I think
shyness is actually one of her
cute points!

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:58.948 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:02.650 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, I was just thinking you're
a real sucker for your sister.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.753 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't think so at all.

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:10.921 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:13.890 position:41% line:89% align:start
Say...

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.323 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have you two kissed yet?

00:05:15.323 --> 00:05:19.260 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? No! Why would you ask that?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.128 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's no good! She's shy so you
got to take the lead.

00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:28.296 position:10% line:71% align:start
Well that's easy for you to
saybut believe it or not, this
is the first time I've ever gone
out with a girl.

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:30.364 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:32.598 position:7% line:89% align:start
You could warm up with... me.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:35.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Consider it a practice kiss.
What do you say?

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:37.835 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh... what?!

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:40.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can just pretend like
you're kissing Ryou.

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:43.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
Since we're twins, it's
practically the same thing.

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:45.639 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:49.074 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:05:57.212 --> 00:05:58.344 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Good! Let's stop there!

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:04.681 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's just a warm-up, so we can't
actually go through with it of
course.

00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:05.982 position:41% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:09.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's with that face?
Did you really want to kiss me?

00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:12.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guh... Why would I want to kiss
you? Are you crazy?

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I'd give you a 60
out of 100.

00:06:15.387 --> 00:06:16.520 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Whatever.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.155 position:30% line:89% align:start
See you later.

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:19.422 position:35% line:89% align:start
See you...

00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:32.196 position:7% line:83% align:start
[student a] I heard they were
kissing in the park.

00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:33.197 position:13% line:89% align:start
[student b] Is that true?

00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:34.396 position:5% line:89% align:start
[student c] Okazaki? That punk?

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:35.997 position:21% line:89% align:start
With Kyou?! Really?

00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:38.299 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well they were in the same
class. They're together a lot.

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:39.532 position:16% line:89% align:start
[student b] I know but-

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
- You idiot!
- It's him! Shh...

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:46.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
Pretty brave of them to do that
in public, don't you think?

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.436 position:10% line:89% align:start
Doesn't seem to bother him.

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:48.838 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:51.605 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>What's with them?</i>

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:53.439 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara] Morning, Okazaki!

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:56.308 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Great, you're acting
weird too?

00:06:56.308 --> 00:06:58.676 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? Me and Kyou?

00:06:58.676 --> 00:07:01.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
The whole school's been talking
about it all day.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.411 position:10% line:83% align:start
You two were kissing in the
park yesterday, right?

00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:07.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh. No. Let's see...
How can I put this?

00:07:07.147 --> 00:07:08.681 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's complicated.

00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:10.815 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't play dumb with me!

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:13.416 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wondered why you've been
in such a good mood lately.

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
So are you two a couple
now or what?

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
We didn't kiss, you jackass.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.385 position:10% line:77% align:start
Do you really think I'd pull
something like that when I'm
going out with her sister?

00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:21.687 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:25.022 position:13% line:83% align:start
You and Ryou Fujibayashi?
You kidding?

00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:26.422 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is it that surprising?

00:07:26.422 --> 00:07:29.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, of course it's surprising.
She's not your type at all.

00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.192 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kyou, on the other hand
is a perfect fit.

00:07:32.192 --> 00:07:34.627 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't need your advice.

00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:37.394 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, do you think Fujibayashi's
heard about this mess?

00:07:37.394 --> 00:07:41.530 position:10% line:77% align:start
If she came to school, then
yeah. Everybody's talking about
it.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.598 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Oh! There you are!

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:45.899 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, hey.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:46.833 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come with me.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, it won't take long.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.202 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara] I didn't do anything!
[Tomoya] Kyou! Hey, wait a
second!

00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:52.669 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come back!

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:09.510 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara] This isn't some kind
of prank is it? I mean, you're
serious?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.313 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, don't hurt my
feelings here. It's not really
that strange, is it?

00:08:13.313 --> 00:08:17.681 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara] I don't know. I just
never, like, sensed any sparks
between us.

00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:19.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
But hey, maybe I never noticed.

00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:21.884 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because we end up seeing
each other so often.

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:22.885 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Yeah...

00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:25.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
That happens a lot with
friends, right?

00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:30.622 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, if you don't believe me,
I have an easy way to prove it.

00:08:34.156 --> 00:08:35.857 position:24% line:89% align:start
Guh-Wait a second.

00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.396 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're acting weird, Kyou. You
don't really love me, do you?

00:08:46.396 --> 00:08:48.430 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why is it so weird to you?

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:58.202 position:13% line:71% align:start
Maybe if I'm just jumping
toconclusions here, but I always
thought you liked Okazaki, not
me.

00:08:58.202 --> 00:09:03.638 position:10% line:83% align:start
N-No! W-What are you talking
about?! I wasn't... I mean...

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:17.312 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara] Just so you know, she
was probably doing that because
of all the rumors.

00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:19.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think she really
likes me.

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:20.713 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Rumors don't matter.

00:09:20.713 --> 00:09:22.514 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara] If she's taking
things this far,

00:09:22.514 --> 00:09:24.615 position:7% line:89% align:start
it might be more than rumors.

00:09:30.752 --> 00:09:32.019 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] You're late.

00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:39.422 position:5% line:77% align:start
Listen, don't pay any attention
to Youhei. He's got the wrong
idea about all this.

00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:45.759 position:10% line:71% align:start
The truth is, when I saw you
andRyou getting together, I
thought it might be nice to have
a boyfriend of my own. That's

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:49.894 position:5% line:77% align:start
Youhei seemed like a good enough
candidate so I asked him out.
But then-

00:09:49.894 --> 00:09:53.130 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Are you kidding?!
[Kyou] Huh?

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.630 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's it? You just pick a
random guy and ask him out

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
because you think it might
be fun?

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:01.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you butting in because you
think that's fun?

00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:12.472 position:5% line:83% align:start
At any rate, forget about me and
worry about Ryou instead.

00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:13.773 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay?

00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:18.043 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't want my sister getting
stressed out about this!

00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:19.509 position:38% line:89% align:start
See you!

00:10:29.348 --> 00:10:30.648 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which do you like?

00:10:36.518 --> 00:10:37.851 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tomoya...

00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:39.219 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:44.588 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to try calling
you by your first name...

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:46.257 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that bad?

00:10:46.257 --> 00:10:47.623 position:19% line:89% align:start
No way. Of course not.

00:10:47.623 --> 00:10:49.091 position:24% line:89% align:start
It isn't strange?

00:10:49.091 --> 00:10:51.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not at all. I call Kyou by
her first-

00:10:54.428 --> 00:10:57.195 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm too formal. I need to get
over it.

00:10:57.195 --> 00:10:59.263 position:27% line:89% align:start
No... It's fine.

00:10:59.263 --> 00:11:04.266 position:7% line:77% align:start
No reason for you to be formal
too, right? Feel free to call me
Ryou.

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:06.967 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right then. Ryou it is.

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
O-Okay Tomoya...

00:11:14.137 --> 00:11:15.570 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm off...

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.972 position:44% line:89% align:start
Bye.

00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:21.808 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Tomoya.

00:11:24.076 --> 00:11:25.977 position:24% line:89% align:start
See you tomorrow.

00:11:30.678 --> 00:11:33.146 position:7% line:89% align:start
I guess I'll go to Sunohara's.

00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:35.314 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! Oh hey! Botan!

00:11:35.314 --> 00:11:36.349 position:41% line:89% align:start
Puhi.

00:11:36.349 --> 00:11:37.749 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What's wrong, buddy?

00:11:37.749 --> 00:11:40.883 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sorry but today's Sunday.
So nobody's here.

00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:42.151 position:41% line:89% align:start
H-hey.

00:11:45.518 --> 00:11:47.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
Botan! Hold on a sec!

00:11:54.724 --> 00:11:55.992 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kyou.

00:11:59.193 --> 00:12:01.894 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tell me what's wrong.

00:12:01.894 --> 00:12:04.229 position:7% line:89% align:start
What? T-There's nothing wrong.

00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:07.731 position:13% line:83% align:start
Weren't you supposed to be
on a date with Ryou right now?

00:12:07.731 --> 00:12:09.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kyou, you're soaking wet.

00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:17.736 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stay away.

00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:22.838 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please... just stay away.

00:12:22.838 --> 00:12:27.774 position:10% line:77% align:start
I-I mean, you don't have to
worry about me! Just worry about
Ryou!

00:12:27.774 --> 00:12:31.175 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's your girlfriend... not me.

00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:34.344 position:13% line:77% align:start
Who cares? You're still my
friend and you're about to catch
a cold.

00:12:34.344 --> 00:12:35.544 position:24% line:89% align:start
Stop! I said, no!

00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:39.213 position:7% line:89% align:start
Leave me alone! Just go away!

00:12:39.213 --> 00:12:41.547 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't bother with me anymore,
all right?

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:42.482 position:30% line:89% align:start
Kyou, listen!

00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:44.016 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go away!

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:48.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hold on...

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.585 position:19% line:89% align:start
C-Come on, stop it...

00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:04.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please don't be nice to
me anymore...

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:07.794 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm an idiot, all right?

00:13:07.794 --> 00:13:12.130 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you be nice to me, I'll get
the wrong idea...

00:13:14.897 --> 00:13:17.132 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] I was afraid...

00:13:17.132 --> 00:13:20.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't want to tell you
how I felt...

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:25.036 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because if I told you I loved
you and you turned me down...

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:29.171 position:7% line:83% align:start
then maybe we wouldn't be able
to be friends anymore...

00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:35.475 position:5% line:77% align:start
But even if you did like me and
we did go out, then it would
just make Ryou miserable...

00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:39.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I thought it would be
better if I just gave up on you.

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:44.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
That way, at least nobody would
get hurt...

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:50.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
But now, I just regret it...
Now I don't know what I want.

00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:56.018 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm so stupid. This was all my
decision in the first place.

00:13:57.286 --> 00:13:58.919 position:27% line:89% align:start
Kyou... listen-

00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:00.686 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tomoya.

00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:04.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm Kyou, all right?
I'm not my sister.

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:07.023 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not your girlfriend.

00:14:11.427 --> 00:14:13.294 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're too late...

00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:17.695 position:30% line:89% align:start
Bye Tomoya...

00:14:33.337 --> 00:14:37.705 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara] Hmm... Sounds like
things are getting complicated
with the twins.

00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:39.407 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's a real problem, huh?

00:14:39.407 --> 00:14:41.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What would you do?

00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:44.708 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara] What do you mean?
If I was in your position?

00:14:44.708 --> 00:14:46.609 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on. That's obvious.

00:14:46.609 --> 00:14:47.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
We'd have a threesome!

00:14:47.944 --> 00:14:49.845 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Can I punch you
until you stop moving?

00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:52.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara] Sorry, sorry.
I'll behave now.

00:14:54.347 --> 00:14:58.149 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know. Seriously this is
kind of a tough one.

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:01.018 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] [sigh] Maybe there's
nothing I can do you know?

00:15:01.018 --> 00:15:03.252 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara] Hmm, giving up
already, huh?

00:15:03.252 --> 00:15:08.121 position:7% line:77% align:start
You think either of them would
be happy if you just ran away?
That'd be pretty pathetic man.

00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:15.758 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know how you feel. Don't want
to get your hands dirty, right?
Can't blame you.

00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:22.828 position:7% line:71% align:start
But you got to face the facts.
Either way, you're going to end
up hurting one of them. You just
got ot make a choice.

00:15:22.828 --> 00:15:28.364 position:13% line:71% align:start
You probably don't want to
hearthis, but the longer you
take to come up with an answer,
the more painful it'll be.

00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:31.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
For Ryou... for Kyou...
and for you.

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:33.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] You're right...

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:38.203 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara] By the way, while
we're on the subject, can I say
one more thing?

00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:44.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your problems are a luxury,
you know that?!

00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:48.707 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:15:48.707 --> 00:15:49.875 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara] Good luck.

00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:52.243 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to get
something to eat.

00:16:07.284 --> 00:16:10.085 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Tomoya.

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:12.686 position:13% line:83% align:start
What did you want to talk
to me about?

00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:18.957 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's just like a TV show.

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:25.127 position:13% line:71% align:start
An empty classroom, a boy
andgirl meeting all alone after
school. First they talk, then
they kiss-

00:16:25.127 --> 00:16:27.128 position:30% line:89% align:start
Fujibayashi...

00:16:27.128 --> 00:16:30.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought we were using
our first names now?

00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:38.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, it's something
I've thought about a lot.

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:42.335 position:13% line:83% align:start
How I didn't want to lose
to my sister, I mean.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:49.272 position:5% line:77% align:start
I knew she had her eye on you. I
knew she was in love with you,
just like I was.

00:16:49.272 --> 00:16:54.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
But even though I knew, I didn't
think of her feelings at all...

00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:59.077 position:7% line:83% align:start
I asked her to help me so that
I could get closer to you.

00:16:59.077 --> 00:17:04.679 position:21% line:71% align:start
[Ryou] She seemed a
littlesurprised at first but
then a big smile spread across
her face.

00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:07.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
"Just leave it to me," she said.

00:17:07.647 --> 00:17:11.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course I knew how
she'd react...

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.918 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I knew I wasn't being
fair to her...

00:17:14.918 --> 00:17:22.054 position:5% line:77% align:start
It was an awful thing to do. But
I still did it because I wanted
to be with you.

00:17:22.054 --> 00:17:25.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's okay! I can try to be more
like my sister if you like!

00:17:25.923 --> 00:17:30.959 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know I'm kind of shy but I can
learn to be more outgoing if you
give me some time!

00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:34.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll grow out my hair,
I'll practice my cooking...

00:17:34.394 --> 00:17:37.596 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll be anything you want, just
please let us stay together,
okay?

00:17:37.596 --> 00:17:38.897 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No.

00:17:40.364 --> 00:17:41.864 position:44% line:89% align:start
No.

00:17:41.864 --> 00:17:44.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's terrible.
I would never ask for that.

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:49.902 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't want to give you up,
Tomoya. I still love you.

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.004 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:07.077 position:41% line:89% align:start
[bang]

00:18:13.747 --> 00:18:15.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
[teacher] Now, on to the
next question.

00:18:15.681 --> 00:18:17.815 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fujibayashi-Oh.

00:18:17.815 --> 00:18:21.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
[teacher] She's absent.
All right then, Suzuki.

00:18:33.124 --> 00:18:35.158 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara] Aren't you
going home?

00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:57.102 position:7% line:77% align:start
I never got to tell you this.
But I had a lot of fun while we
were going out.

00:18:57.102 --> 00:19:01.672 position:5% line:77% align:start
To be honest, I never felt like
anyone loved me or anyone needed
me before.

00:19:01.672 --> 00:19:04.773 position:21% line:89% align:start
It was really nice.

00:19:04.773 --> 00:19:10.842 position:5% line:77% align:start
We got along so well. I thought
we could be together for a long
time. But then I...

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:15.778 position:10% line:89% align:start
I ruined it for both of us.

00:19:17.712 --> 00:19:20.548 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry.
I did something terrible.

00:19:20.548 --> 00:19:24.983 position:10% line:77% align:start
Even though I had you, I was
always thinking about someone
else.

00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:28.319 position:13% line:83% align:start
By the time I realized how
I felt, it was too late...

00:19:29.485 --> 00:19:32.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
I kept quiet. I took
advantage of you...

00:19:33.321 --> 00:19:36.489 position:33% line:89% align:start
Because I...

00:19:36.489 --> 00:19:41.958 position:5% line:77% align:start
I wasn't in love with you... It
was Kyou that I was really in
love with...

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:47.061 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Tomoya...

00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:52.664 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Kyou?!

00:19:52.664 --> 00:19:56.932 position:7% line:83% align:start
What are you... W-What are you
doing here? And your hair...?

00:19:57.932 --> 00:20:00.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
She told me to come...

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:05.003 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ryou chewed me out...
She said not to run away.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:09.072 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I was fine with the way
things were.

00:20:09.072 --> 00:20:10.540 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just wanted her to be happy.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.541 position:30% line:83% align:start
I didn't mean
to fall in love with you.

00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:14.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
I didn't mean to hurt her.

00:20:14.975 --> 00:20:20.378 position:5% line:77% align:start
But she told me it was too late.
The damage had already been
done.

00:20:20.378 --> 00:20:26.047 position:16% line:71% align:start
That's why she said that
Icouldn't run away. If I really
loved you, then I had to take
responsibility for that.

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:32.284 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course she was hurt but
there was no other way.

00:20:32.284 --> 00:20:38.654 position:5% line:77% align:start
Since we both fell in love with
the same person, one of us would
end up suffering.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:45.223 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure she's crying right now.

00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:49.826 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look at us. Sure took us
a long time, didn't it?

00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:55.095 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not realizing our feelings,
hiding and running away...

00:20:57.162 --> 00:21:02.299 position:7% line:83% align:start
Today will be the last time we
hurt each other, all right?

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:07.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
For my sister, for me,
and for you...

00:21:08.868 --> 00:21:10.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:21:13.004 --> 00:21:16.339 position:21% line:89% align:start
I love you, Tomoya.

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:22.242 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I've loved you for
a long, long time.

00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:34.781 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] Please don't apologize.

00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:36.249 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] But...

00:21:36.249 --> 00:21:38.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you apologize, I'll have
to forgive you,

00:21:38.584 --> 00:21:41.586 position:7% line:83% align:start
and then it'll be like nothing
ever happened at all.

00:21:41.586 --> 00:21:46.254 position:10% line:77% align:start
I don't want that. I want to
cherish every moment we spent
together...

00:21:46.254 --> 00:21:48.389 position:13% line:89% align:start
I want to remember it all!

00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:49.889 position:27% line:89% align:start
The fun times...

00:21:49.889 --> 00:21:51.591 position:27% line:89% align:start
The sad times...

00:21:51.591 --> 00:21:53.057 position:30% line:89% align:start
Everything...

00:21:53.057 --> 00:22:00.128 position:33% line:83% align:start
So please...
please don't apologize.

00:22:01.094 --> 00:22:02.962 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I understand.

00:22:02.962 --> 00:22:04.863 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thank you...

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:13.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, by the way, where are
we going tomorrow?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
You said you wanted to do
something with me, right?

00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:17.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry. I got to cancel that.

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:19.070 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.004 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ryou said she wanted to go
shopping together.

00:22:21.004 --> 00:22:22.905 position:7% line:89% align:start
We haven't done that in ages.

00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:25.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll have to take a
rain check!

00:22:25.508 --> 00:22:28.175 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well I guess there's nothing
I can do.

00:22:28.175 --> 00:22:31.043 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right. Just be a man
and take it.

00:22:34.512 --> 00:22:36.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] It sure has been
hot lately.

00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:38.846 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No kidding.

00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:44.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Hey, are you sure you're
happy picking me? [Tomoya] Huh?

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.720 position:13% line:71% align:start
I mean, things would have
beenless complicated if you'd
stuck with Ryou and I know I can
be a pain.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.820 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't say that. I'll get mad.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:57.724 position:7% line:77% align:start
Go ahead. Get as mad as you'd
like. Actually I'd feel a bit
better if you did.

00:22:57.724 --> 00:23:00.425 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't even know what
you're saying anymore.

00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:03.893 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right, then I'll make it
plain and simple for you.

00:23:07.462 --> 00:23:09.862 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey! Give me a break!

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:26.137 position:21% line:89% align:start
Tomoya. I love you.

00:23:30.406 --> 00:23:32.708 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Summer's coming,
isn't it?

00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:34.308 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah...
