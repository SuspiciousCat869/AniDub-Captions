Kind: captions

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:09.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
You did real good
out there today.

00:00:09.638 --> 00:00:11.239 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?,

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're a quick learner
and everything you do

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.877 position:24% line:89% align:start
is really precise.

00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:16.779 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're probably well-suited
to this kind of job.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, are you actually
giving me a compliment...?

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:22.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
Try not to let it
go to your head.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
You do the same thing every day,
so it's only natural

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.191 position:21% line:89% align:start
that you get better.

00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:27.425 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fair enough.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.102 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: All the guys who
sat next to me in school

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.005 position:7% line:89% align:start
have probably moved away now.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're probably going
to college in other towns.

00:00:40.308 --> 00:00:43.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
But... even if I'm the
only one who stayed here...

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:46.148 position:10% line:89% align:start
that doesn't mean I'm alone.

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:48.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are other people
working and sweating

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:50.520 position:21% line:83% align:start
and getting covered
in grime just like me.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.625 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is the new place I chose
for myself. The place I earned.

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:30.275 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
Now it's time for a quiz!

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
ÚThank you, ladies. Thank you.
Yay!

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:35.715 position:7% line:83% align:start
@Now which of the followingúis
Akio's super hot event

00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:37.551 position:27% line:83% align:start
to kick off the
summer with a bang?!

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
One: Barbeque at the beach!

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:41.656 position:7% line:89% align:start
Two: Beauty rest at the beach!

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.160 position:19% line:83% align:start
Three: Barbara Fujioka
at the beach!

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
They sound so similar,
I don't know which to pick!

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:47.930 position:30% line:83% align:start
@But that last
oneúdoesn't fit at all.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure it does; It starts
with a "B", doesn't it?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who wouldn't want to play
with Barbara Fujioka?!

00:02:52.436 --> 00:02:54.072 position:10% line:89% align:start
@Is that evenúa real person?

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:55.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
You can have Barbara, I just
want to play with Nagisa!

00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:58.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've been so lonely without
her; I'll do anything!

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.612 position:24% line:89% align:start
I-I'm sorry, Dad!

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:03.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't mind him, he's just having
a tough time letting Nagisa go

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.585 position:19% line:89% align:start
after all these years.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.821 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's only natural for you
to spend time together.

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.056 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.659 position:7% line:89% align:start
So I guess I gotta share, huh?

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:20.570 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Good to see you
parents are as energetic as
ever.

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.408 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
Something on your mind?

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:30.448 position:7% line:89% align:start
I uh... think we need to talk.

00:03:30.448 --> 00:03:32.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
What is it? You need
a swimsuit for the beach?

00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:35.321 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mm-mmm. No, it's not that.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, I mean... now that
you mention it,

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:39.493 position:16% line:89% align:start
I could use a new one...

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:41.328 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right. I get off
work early tomorrow,

00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:42.262 position:24% line:83% align:start
so we can go shop
for one together.

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:45.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh... really? Are you sure?

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: You probably only have
your school swimsuit, right?

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:51.608 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Yeah. But it's
not bad. I don't mind.

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:54.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: I mind. I want my
girlfriend to look cute.

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, we don't get to
go to the beach very often.

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:58.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet all the other
guys'll be jealous

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.951 position:13% line:89% align:start
when they see you with me!

00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:01.586 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: No way! I don't look
that good in a swimsuit...!

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:03.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll see about that, won't we?

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:05.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
When I get off work,
we'll shop til we drop!

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:06.626 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:07.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now that's settled...

00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:11.398 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, that's not it.

00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not about swimsuits
after all? Oh, then...

00:04:13.968 --> 00:04:15.570 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:04:19.308 --> 00:04:21.011 position:13% line:89% align:start
I brought this up before,

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
but have you seen your
father since you moved

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:24.581 position:19% line:89% align:start
to your new apartment?

00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.117 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, did you at
least give him a call

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:28.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
to let him know where
you're living now?

00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:30.989 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not yet...

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:33.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: You understand the
situation, don't you?

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.361 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're pretty much completely
estranged from each other.

00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:38.498 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not something
that's gonna change.

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:40.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
But, you-

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:42.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
I work almost every day now!

00:04:43.737 --> 00:04:47.042 position:7% line:83% align:start
With my job, I'm totally worn
out by the end of the day.

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:50.546 position:16% line:83% align:start
When I DO get a day off,
I want to spend it with you.

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:53.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't want to do
anything unpleasant.

00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:57.121 position:21% line:83% align:start
I understand if you
can't do it right away...

00:04:57.121 --> 00:04:58.455 position:16% line:89% align:start
But one of these days...

00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:01.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
let's go talk to
your father... together.

00:05:02.194 --> 00:05:05.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right. Someday.

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:08.434 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Yeah. Someday for sure.

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:17.112 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Boss]: I know this is out of
the blue, but an old colleague
of mine

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:19.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
is the manager of
a contracting company.

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, he's looking
for a someone young

00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:24.288 position:13% line:83% align:start
to supervise construction
sites for him.

00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:25.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh...?

00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:27.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, it'd be an
apprenticeship at first.

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.161 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it's a salaried
position and everything.

00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:33.832 position:10% line:89% align:start
Umm... The pay is... Ummm...

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:36.569 position:7% line:89% align:start
Should be something like this.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.904 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow, that's pretty nice.

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.973 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah? Well, I'm glad
you think so,

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
since I was considering
recommending you for the job.

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:43.844 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.047 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you interested
in trying it out?

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:49.484 position:10% line:83% align:start
W-Wait a sec, I'm confused;
Does this mean I'm fired?

00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:51.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:52.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
The boss isn't looking
to get rid of you,

00:05:52.888 --> 00:05:54.758 position:7% line:89% align:start
he's trying to do you a favor.

00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:56.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't have to
decide right away.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.561 position:13% line:89% align:start
But, it's a good offer...

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.998 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd like for you to
seriously consider it.

00:06:00.998 --> 00:06:02.466 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:06.738 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]:
I don't see the downside.

00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:08.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know, but I put
a lot into this job;

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:11.011 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought I'd always
work for this company.

00:06:11.011 --> 00:06:12.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, I think you're
better suited for a

00:06:12.713 --> 00:06:15.116 position:21% line:83% align:start
supervising position
than someone like me.

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:17.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]: I'm not good
at dealing with people.

00:06:17.218 --> 00:06:20.789 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm a decent workman, but
I'd make an awful supervisor.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, you're younger
and you have more potential.

00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:26.430 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya sighs]
But this is so sudden.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.700 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]: Sudden or not, the
pay is more than you'll ever
make here.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.703 position:7% line:89% align:start
And even if you like it here,

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
someday you'll have a family
to support... Right?

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:38.244 position:24% line:83% align:start
If there's someone
you really care about,

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:41.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'd be surprised how much you
can overcome for their sake.

00:06:43.184 --> 00:06:44.584 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is that why you're here?

00:06:44.584 --> 00:06:45.886 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, did you
stick with this job

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:48.123 position:24% line:83% align:start
because of someone
you care about?

00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:53.930 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah, sorry, I guess that was
kinda personal. Forget it.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here, let me tell you
a little story.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.704 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?,

00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:02.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a story of a
rebel from this town

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
who used to play rock and roll.

00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:10.150 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]: Ever since he was a
kid, he did whatever he
wanted...

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.918 position:21% line:89% align:start
whenever he wanted.

00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:14.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
There was no one around to scold
him or teach him any better,

00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.958 position:27% line:83% align:start
so he was always
getting into trouble.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.926 position:7% line:83% align:start
When he was in high school, a
lot of kids thought it was cool

00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:22.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
to start your own band...
so, he took up the guitar.

00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
He didn't have anyone to play
with, so he'd storm the stage

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:26.903 position:7% line:83% align:start
while other bands were playing
and steal the spotlight.

00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:30.074 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was always doing
wild things like that.

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:36.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
When he was a senior,
he met someone.

00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:39.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
Much to his surprise,
she really liked his love songs.

00:07:40.553 --> 00:07:41.788 position:7% line:89% align:start
They had embarrassing lyrics,

00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:43.723 position:27% line:83% align:start
but she was able
to look past that

00:07:43.723 --> 00:07:46.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
and understand the
sincerity behind them.

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:48.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sometimes she would enjoy
talking to him so much

00:07:48.396 --> 00:07:50.632 position:10% line:83% align:start
that she would lose track of
time and forget that she had

00:07:50.632 --> 00:07:52.600 position:24% line:89% align:start
a class to teach.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:56.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
She was a bit clumsy,
but he didn't mind.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
The boy graduated
and was confident

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he could make a
living off of his music.

00:08:04.982 --> 00:08:06.684 position:7% line:89% align:start
His classmates laughed at him,

00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:09.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
but the teacher who liked
his love songs cheered him on.

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.292 position:13% line:83% align:start
"If you keep trying you'll
get your wish someday...

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.429 position:24% line:89% align:start
so never give up."

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:18.333 position:10% line:83% align:start
On the day they parted ways,
the boy told her.

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:22.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
"I'm gonna become a star. When I
do... please go out with me."

00:08:25.007 --> 00:08:27.243 position:19% line:83% align:start
From that day forward
he made up his mind...

00:08:27.243 --> 00:08:30.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
he was going to be a star,
no matter what.

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:35.820 position:13% line:83% align:start
As if it was meant to be,
he made his professional debut

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.655 position:33% line:89% align:start
in no time.

00:08:37.655 --> 00:08:40.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
He wanted to gloat to all those
who said he couldn't do it...

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:43.729 position:7% line:89% align:start
but they were long since gone.

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:45.699 position:16% line:83% align:start
From then on, he worked
with all his might...

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
he put everything he had
into his music...

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
he sang about what
he wanted to sing about

00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:52.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
with all the passion
he could muster.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.642 position:16% line:89% align:start
As if he was sobbing...

00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:56.279 position:13% line:83% align:start
As if he were vomiting up
the words from his belly,

00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:09.194 position:16% line:83% align:start
He sang of all the ugly
things in this world.

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:11.696 position:13% line:83% align:start
And yet, for all the bile
that escaped his lips,

00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:14.368 position:13% line:89% align:start
his songs were beautiful.

00:09:14.368 --> 00:09:17.838 position:27% line:83% align:start
To him, life was
the ugliest of things...

00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:21.776 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it was wonderful...
it was a refreshing.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.417 position:5% line:89% align:start
He had finally found his place.

00:09:31.622 --> 00:09:35.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
@One day, he received an
offerúfrom a television station.

00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:37.362 position:10% line:89% align:start
@He was going meet his fans.

00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:40.899 position:13% line:83% align:start
@But not just any fans...
úfans who had been inspired,

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:42.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
who had been saved
by his music...

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:47.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
@fans who were facing adversity
and turmoil even then.

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:51.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those who were sick... those who
had been hurt in accidents...

00:09:51.346 --> 00:09:53.081 position:21% line:83% align:start
those who had faced
terrible hardships

00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:55.850 position:13% line:89% align:start
because of their families.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.920 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those whose hearts were
so bruised and battered

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
that they could break down
at any moment...

00:10:03.293 --> 00:10:06.030 position:30% line:83% align:start
They were all
in the midst of suffering.

00:10:07.098 --> 00:10:08.933 position:16% line:83% align:start
They all used his music
for support

00:10:08.933 --> 00:10:11.303 position:10% line:89% align:start
when they had nothing else.

00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:15.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
The boy learned that his
songs were not only his own...

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:17.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
they belonged to
his listeners as well.

00:10:17.244 --> 00:10:19.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was something
he'd never imagined.

00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:25.087 position:16% line:83% align:start
Until then, he had been
making music only for himself.

00:10:25.087 --> 00:10:27.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
That was the only thing
that mattered.

00:10:28.157 --> 00:10:29.892 position:7% line:89% align:start
But things were different now.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
He realized that
he had to make music

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:32.862 position:27% line:83% align:start
for hundreds of
thousands of people...

00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:35.366 position:5% line:89% align:start
people he had never met before.

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:47.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
Suddenly... he couldn't
write songs anymore.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
He saw how big and grand
the world was...

00:10:50.318 --> 00:10:52.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
how foolish and
superficial he had been.

00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:56.425 position:16% line:77% align:start
@How could he create the
sameúselfish music he made
before?

00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:58.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
His agency told him
to take some time off.

00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:02.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
And then... half a year later...

00:11:04.235 --> 00:11:06.570 position:10% line:83% align:start
@He discovered that someone
he had met on the show

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.072 position:24% line:89% align:start
committed a crime.

00:11:08.072 --> 00:11:09.608 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was a serious crime...

00:11:09.608 --> 00:11:12.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
a terrible one that
couldn't be undone.

00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:17.050 position:19% line:77% align:start
@From that point on...
everything started to fall
apart.

00:11:22.022 --> 00:11:23.658 position:27% line:83% align:start
The man who had
committed the crime

00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:25.728 position:7% line:83% align:start
@said that the boy's songsúhad
helped him keep his life

00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:29.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
together in the past...
úthat they had helped him relax.

00:11:29.432 --> 00:11:30.900 position:21% line:83% align:start
He said he had been
waiting a long time

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.537 position:5% line:89% align:start
to hear new music from the boy.

00:11:33.537 --> 00:11:36.808 position:27% line:83% align:start
The boy thought
that it was all his fault.

00:11:36.808 --> 00:11:40.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
If only he had kept singing...
if only he hadn't taken away

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:44.149 position:10% line:83% align:start
the man's hope... then maybe
none of this would've happened.

00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:47.454 position:16% line:89% align:start
He began to sing again.

00:11:47.454 --> 00:11:51.425 position:5% line:83% align:start
He sang of impossible dreams...
high-sounding ideas...

00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:52.893 position:27% line:89% align:start
empty idealism.

00:11:52.893 --> 00:11:55.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
He didn't know why he was
singing about these things...

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:57.899 position:30% line:83% align:start
he didn't even
understand them, himself.

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:00.670 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, he brushed
aside his doubts

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
and sang with all his strength,

00:12:02.372 --> 00:12:05.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
bellowing meaningless words
at the top of his lungs

00:12:05.075 --> 00:12:06.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
in vain hope that he might save

00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:09.113 position:21% line:83% align:start
those who had placed
their faith in him.

00:12:09.113 --> 00:12:12.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
Before long his songs
strayed away from idealism

00:12:12.016 --> 00:12:13.686 position:27% line:89% align:start
and revolution.

00:12:13.686 --> 00:12:16.790 position:10% line:83% align:start
His desperate cries for hope
turned to screams of disgust

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
raised against a corrupt world.

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:22.764 position:5% line:83% align:start
Only despair and disillusionment
could be gained from his music.

00:12:22.764 --> 00:12:26.869 position:5% line:83% align:start
His lyrics became incoherent...
full of contradictions.

00:12:26.869 --> 00:12:28.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
Even so, he continued to sing.

00:12:28.704 --> 00:12:33.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
Desperately... hopelessly,
because he was afraid to stop.

00:12:35.245 --> 00:12:37.013 position:27% line:83% align:start
He was afraid of
what might happen

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:39.350 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the people who
depended on him.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.219 position:13% line:89% align:start
@And in his desperation...

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:44.256 position:10% line:89% align:start
@He completely lost his way.

00:12:44.256 --> 00:12:47.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
He made a mistake that he
could never take back.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.061 position:19% line:83% align:start
When word of his crime
reached the public,

00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:51.398 position:24% line:83% align:start
he was thrown out
like old garbage.

00:12:51.398 --> 00:12:53.735 position:16% line:83% align:start
He had hit rock bottom,
with nowhere to go

00:12:53.735 --> 00:12:55.804 position:16% line:89% align:start
and nothing to cling to.

00:12:55.804 --> 00:13:01.043 position:13% line:83% align:start
Only one thought echoed in
his mind... one final wish...

00:13:01.043 --> 00:13:03.078 position:19% line:89% align:start
He wanted to go home.

00:13:40.325 --> 00:13:44.128 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's been a while.
Are you still making music?

00:13:44.128 --> 00:13:47.266 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]: He had left
all of this far behind.

00:13:47.266 --> 00:13:49.268 position:16% line:89% align:start
Everything had changed.

00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:52.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you keep trying you'll
get your wish someday...

00:13:53.508 --> 00:13:55.776 position:10% line:89% align:start
so never give up, all right?

00:13:55.776 --> 00:13:58.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]: He realized
that he had lost sight

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:01.083 position:10% line:89% align:start
of something very important.

00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:02.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
No matter what turn
his life took,

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:05.856 position:10% line:89% align:start
he should have kept singing.

00:14:05.856 --> 00:14:08.726 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even if his songsúcouldn't
save the world...

00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:12.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
he could still sing
love songs... for her.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.499 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, we're here.

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:15.902 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:17.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just as well, since that's
the end of the story.

00:14:17.837 --> 00:14:20.039 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, right!

00:14:21.107 --> 00:14:23.510 position:27% line:89% align:start
@Okazaki. Yeah?

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.246 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't ever lose sight of
what's important to you.

00:14:26.848 --> 00:14:28.316 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yessir.

00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:34.323 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: I see...,

00:14:34.323 --> 00:14:35.892 position:10% line:89% align:start
I support you either way...

00:14:35.892 --> 00:14:39.329 position:7% line:83% align:start
so whichever choice you think
is best, is best for me.

00:14:39.764 --> 00:14:41.365 position:38% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:14:41.365 --> 00:14:43.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then, assuming you don't
have any objections,

00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:45.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think I might
take the deal after all.

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:47.372 position:7% line:89% align:start
Great. But why would I object?

00:14:47.372 --> 00:14:50.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're just taking notice
of your hard work, right?

00:14:51.177 --> 00:14:52.078 position:30% line:89% align:start
I guess so...

00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:53.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
I know so!,

00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:57.184 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right, it's settled!

00:14:57.184 --> 00:14:58.653 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yep!,

00:15:01.924 --> 00:15:03.359 position:33% line:89% align:start
Bring it on!

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:05.996 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm surprised, Okazaki,
aren't you going to play?

00:15:05.996 --> 00:15:07.698 position:10% line:89% align:start
[uneasy chuckle] I'm, uh...

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.001 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, I get it, you'd rather
stay with your girlfriend

00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:11.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
than play with children, right?

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:13.504 position:16% line:89% align:start
[uncomfortable chuckle]

00:15:13.504 --> 00:15:16.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't blame him; You've grown
up to be so pretty, Nagisa!

00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:18.811 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thanks! That's nice of you
to say, ma'am!

00:15:18.811 --> 00:15:21.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Hatted Woman] You look just
like I did when I was your age!

00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:23.216 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Brown-haired Woman]:
Really now!

00:15:23.216 --> 00:15:26.787 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:15:28.322 --> 00:15:30.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: We're going to
the beach tomorrow, huh?

00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:31.693 position:16% line:89% align:start
Man, it's been a while.

00:15:31.693 --> 00:15:33.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, I feel like
your kindness

00:15:33.763 --> 00:15:36.499 position:16% line:83% align:start
has really been shining
through lately.

00:15:36.499 --> 00:15:38.569 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even though you
were just talking

00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:40.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
with a bunch of housewives, you
seemed to be enjoying yourself.

00:15:40.604 --> 00:15:43.108 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your smile was really sincere.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.543 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: It's strange, I used
to think being nice to people

00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:48.447 position:10% line:83% align:start
was a hassle. That's ironic,
considering how I was always

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
butting into other
people's problems.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.353 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is being nice
still a hassle now?

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:56.924 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:16:05.702 --> 00:16:07.537 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:16:07.537 --> 00:16:08.905 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hold on just a sec.
I'll get it for you.

00:16:08.905 --> 00:16:10.941 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's great; Thank you.

00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:17.382 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hello, Okazaki residence.

00:16:17.382 --> 00:16:21.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes. He's in the other room,
I'll go get him for you.

00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:25.392 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tomoya... it's someone
from Hikarisaka Electric!

00:16:25.392 --> 00:16:28.195 position:10% line:83% align:start
Huh?! You don't think I got
the job already, do you?

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.299 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hello, Okazaki speaking.

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:34.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, hi Boss. Can I
help you with something?

00:16:35.438 --> 00:16:38.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? From Kinoshita?

00:16:38.507 --> 00:16:41.511 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, okay. What's his number?

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:45.583 position:33% line:89% align:start
Okay. Yeah.

00:16:45.583 --> 00:16:49.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
Got it. Yeah, thanks for giving
me a call; I appreciate it.

00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:51.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes sir, I'll talk to you soon.

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:55.228 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:16:55.228 --> 00:16:58.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
They said one of my dad's
associates called for me.

00:16:58.032 --> 00:16:59.633 position:35% line:89% align:start
I dunno...

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:04.272 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Kinoshita]:
Hello, this is Kinoshita.

00:17:04.272 --> 00:17:06.241 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah, this is Okazaki.

00:17:06.241 --> 00:17:08.578 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Kinoshita]:
Oh! Tomoya?! Bad news!

00:17:08.578 --> 00:17:10.446 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.716 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Kinoshita]Úit, uh... it's
about your father.@He was
arrested by the police.

00:17:12.716 --> 00:17:14.919 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kinoshita]: Apparently, he was
dealing in something illegal.

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:19.191 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just heard the story myself,
so I thought I'd better

00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:21.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
contact you, in case
you didn't know.

00:17:23.362 --> 00:17:26.500 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: This is a small town,
so rumors spread quickly.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.568 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know how it is.

00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:30.671 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, anyway... I'm sorry,
but the construction company

00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:33.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
is withdrawing their job offer.

00:17:34.143 --> 00:17:35.978 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see...

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it's any consolation, you're
still welcome here, of course.

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:41.651 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nothing has changed.

00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:43.721 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: This just
happened at a bad time...

00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:45.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'll have other opportunities.

00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:47.926 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't let it get you down.

00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:52.632 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:54.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:17:54.234 --> 00:17:56.236 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you say we leave
this town? Just you and me.

00:17:56.236 --> 00:17:59.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
I should've realized it sooner,
but my father is like

00:17:59.207 --> 00:18:02.010 position:21% line:83% align:start
some kind of curse.
He ruins everything for me.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want to start over
somewhere as far away

00:18:04.013 --> 00:18:05.581 position:19% line:89% align:start
from him as possible.

00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.118 position:16% line:89% align:start
No... you can't do that.

00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:09.986 position:5% line:89% align:start
That would be like running away!

00:18:09.986 --> 00:18:13.024 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is something
you have to work out!

00:18:15.092 --> 00:18:16.928 position:19% line:89% align:start
We don't have to run;

00:18:16.928 --> 00:18:19.665 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll be happy as long as
we have each other... right?

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:21.301 position:27% line:83% align:start
But why does it
have to be here?!;

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.435 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can be happy
anywhere, can't we?!

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
You said we'd be happy as
long as we have each other,

00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:29.176 position:33% line:89% align:start
didn't you?

00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:32.013 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't mean that we have
to stay here for sure;

00:18:32.013 --> 00:18:34.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll go anywhere as long
as I'm with you.

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:36.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... when we leave this town,
we have to leave with

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:39.755 position:7% line:83% align:start
positive feelings, not because
we're running away.

00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:42.391 position:7% line:83% align:start
If we leave with regret, then
we won't be able to come back;

00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:45.429 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'll be throwing it away.

00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:49.134 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is our town. This is the
place were you and I were born.

00:18:49.134 --> 00:18:53.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not something we
should just throw away.

00:18:53.138 --> 00:18:56.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even if nothing good
ever happened here?

00:18:56.643 --> 00:19:00.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
I dunno, a lot of good
things happened to me.

00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.151 position:7% line:83% align:start
Meeting you is the best thing
that's happened to me

00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:04.753 position:24% line:89% align:start
in my entire life.

00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:20.171 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:19:20.171 --> 00:19:24.710 position:7% line:83% align:start
What are trying to pull? What
the hell do you want from me?

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.381 position:7% line:83% align:start
You think it's fun to screw up
other people's lives,

00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:29.283 position:33% line:89% align:start
is that it?

00:19:29.283 --> 00:19:32.353 position:13% line:83% align:start
To be honest, I don't even
consider you my father anymore.

00:19:32.353 --> 00:19:35.056 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course... that doesn't seem
to make any difference

00:19:35.056 --> 00:19:36.658 position:27% line:89% align:start
to anyone else.

00:19:36.658 --> 00:19:39.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
To the rest of the world,
I'm still your son.

00:19:41.664 --> 00:19:45.669 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on! Don't you have
anything to say about this?

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:47.838 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you have anything
to say to the son who's life

00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:50.541 position:27% line:83% align:start
you've destroyed
over and over again?

00:19:52.611 --> 00:19:54.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
What the hell's wrong with you?!

00:19:54.446 --> 00:19:56.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
T-Tomoya, stop!

00:19:56.916 --> 00:20:00.054 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've had enough. I have
nothing more to say to you;

00:20:00.054 --> 00:20:01.121 position:24% line:89% align:start
There's no point.

00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:03.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can rot in Hell
for all I care!

00:20:03.457 --> 00:20:04.693 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tomoya!

00:20:04.693 --> 00:20:06.561 position:30% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:14.237 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Tomoya, wait!

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hold on, come back!

00:20:23.182 --> 00:20:24.650 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:20:26.386 --> 00:20:28.855 position:7% line:89% align:start
Stop it; What are you doing?!

00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:45.541 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tomoya! Tomoya, stop!

00:20:48.012 --> 00:20:51.216 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tomoya! Tomoya!

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.619 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa sobbing]

00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:11.907 position:16% line:89% align:start
Does... your hand hurt?

00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:14.044 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:21:14.044 --> 00:21:16.713 position:5% line:89% align:start
It'll hurt when you take a bath.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.183 position:30% line:89% align:start
Probably so...

00:21:22.054 --> 00:21:23.021 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa.

00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:23.789 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:25.791 position:21% line:89% align:start
Will you marry me?,

00:21:26.558 --> 00:21:27.927 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:21:32.733 --> 00:21:34.101 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:21:34.101 --> 00:21:35.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
For as long as we've
been together,

00:21:35.904 --> 00:21:39.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've known you were
the only one. I mean it.

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:42.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even if I'm like this? Even
though... I'm so pathetic?

00:21:42.778 --> 00:21:46.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's fine.; I'm
pathetic, too. But...

00:21:46.416 --> 00:21:50.154 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think if we're together...
we can grow stronger.

00:21:55.394 --> 00:21:57.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then... you'll stay with me...?

00:21:59.699 --> 00:22:02.369 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes... Of course
I'll stay with you.

00:22:02.369 --> 00:22:07.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: No matter what
happens. Forever and ever.

00:23:42.324 --> 00:23:45.228 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's fine. I'm the one
who should be sorry.

00:23:45.228 --> 00:23:48.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: Don't say that.
None of us feel that way...

00:23:48.165 --> 00:23:51.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
not me, not Akio and
certainly not Nagisa.

00:23:51.703 --> 00:23:54.038 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wish everyone else
was like that.

00:23:54.038 --> 00:23:56.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who knows if I'll ever get
a job offer that good again.

00:23:56.709 --> 00:23:57.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair.

00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:59.812 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, if your life
can change once,

00:23:59.812 --> 00:24:02.048 position:24% line:83% align:start
then it can change
again for the better.

00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:04.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: Look at that, just like
me, when I was that age.

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:08.155 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was in a hurry to grow up,
even though I didn't know why.

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:10.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess kids never learn, do they?
