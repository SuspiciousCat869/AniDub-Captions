[voice] <i>We finally ventured</i>
 <i>outside of the building.</i>

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
  [girl] Be careful
  not to go too far.

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:15.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you aren't careful, you might
not be able to make it back.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
[voice] <i>This is a world that</i>
 <i>has ended...</i>

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:20.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>an empty sad place.</i>

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:24.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>A place where we are all alone.</i>

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:26.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>We were looking for scraps...</i>

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:30.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
  <i>bits and pieces of anything</i>
  <i>that might be useful to us.</i>

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:31.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
   <i>In this world...</i>

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:36.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>we are forced to scavenge</i>
 <i>if we hope to survive.</i>

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here we go. This one too.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl] Were you scared?

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:45.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:48.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad you could make it back.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:52.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
There you go.

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:02.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's strange, isn't it?

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:08.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
They had such
a gentle aura to them...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are we eating lunch
in the cafeteria?

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
  Wait a sec. You just
  got here, didn't you?

00:03:50.434 --> 00:03:51.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then you gotta make some
kind of opening statement.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you don't, it'll throw
me off all afternoon.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:58.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei groans]

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:02.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, fine.
I'll just do it over again.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! How are you, Okazaki?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where would you enjoy
eating lunch today?

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:09.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sigh] Way too eloquent.

00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:11.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm saying that was too
eloquent for you.

00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:16.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was so out of character,
I don't know how to respond.

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then what do you want me to do?

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:18.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
Try saying "all that
and a toilet"

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:20.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
at the end
of your sentences.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
That'll take an edge
off the eloquence

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:24.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
and make it sound more
low-brow, like you.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:27.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, whatever.

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe some other time, okay?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Huh? Mei's staying at
your place again?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you okay with that?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Of course!
We don't mind at all!

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:42.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
The whole family loves Mei.

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:45.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
And just for the record,
she already told your parents

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:47.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
and okayed it with her
school back home.

00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:49.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
She wanted to stick around
and keep an eye on you.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:53.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
My brother's in his last
semester of high school

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
and he still doesn't know
what to do with himself.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:58.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd better stay here;
I'm too worried to go home.

00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Mei said she wants to have
 a nice, long talk with you,

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
 so you'd be ready.

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:04.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Sunohara,

00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:06.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
have you ever thought
about your future goals...

00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
or what you want
to do with yourself?

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:11.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmm. Can't say
it comes to mind, no.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Obviously, college
is out of the question,

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:18.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I guess I'll just find any
old job and work any old way.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:21.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... if I happened to find a
responsible girlfriend

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:22.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
to look after me,

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:25.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet Mei wouldn't be
so worried all the time.

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:29.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah! That's it!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
All you gotta do is pretend
like you're going out

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:32.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
with some nice girl.

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Someone really smart,
or dependable or whatever.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can introduce her to Mei,
and then she'll stop worrying!

00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:38.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
 I see what you mean,
 but it's not good to lie...

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:41.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know. You think anyone
would go for that?

00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:42.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, sure, why not?

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:44.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, It's not like you're
ugly or anything.

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:47.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if you have a rotten
personality,

00:05:47.234 --> 00:05:48.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
you still have a baby face!

00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:50.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
You appeal to their
maternal instinct!

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:52.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're Baby Sunohara!

00:05:53.634 --> 00:05:54.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Y-you think so?

00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:56.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
And just think, if you
and your fake girlfriend

00:05:56.767 --> 00:05:57.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
happen to hit it off,

00:05:58.067 --> 00:05:59.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
it might even turn into
a real relationship!

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:02.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa! The Okazaki magic, huh?

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:05.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right! Bring it on!
I'm ready to rock!

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:07.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, are you
actually helping him

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
or just having
fun at his expense?

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
A little bit of both,
but it'll be fine.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's see, let's see,
I need someone smart,

00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:16.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
with good manners and she's
gotta be cute, too...

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
See? Now there's a man
who knows what he wants.

00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:20.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! Of course!
She's perfect!

00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:22.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei chuckles]
Here I come!

00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hold on! You're not
really gonna ask her?!

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:27.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:06:30.133 --> 00:06:31.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ryou] What?!

00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:33.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, you don't have
to look that surprised!

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:34.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's just pretend!

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:35.934 position:50% line:83% align:start
Nothing to get
worked up about!

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:37.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you don't want to do it,

00:06:37.234 --> 00:06:39.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
then we're not
gonna force you, okay?

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, you know what
kind of guy he is,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I wouldn't exactly
blame you for saying no.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
  No, I can't do it!

00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:47.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
  It's just too much
  for me, way too much!

00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:51.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's so embarrassing just
thinking about it...

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:52.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just can't...

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:54.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Ryou crying]

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:56.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It's okay, Ryou.
Please don't cry!

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hate to admit it,
but the more she says no,

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:03.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
the more I wanna bug her
'til she says yes.

00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:05.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
Watch it, man. I wouldn't say
that if I were you...

00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:08.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Kyou grunting, yelling]

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [Youhei chuckles]

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:14.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:18.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
Was he picking on you?
I'm sorry, Ryou.

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:22.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I'm okay...
I-it's nothing like that.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
Which one of you brutes did this
to my precious little sister?!

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:26.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [screams]

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:28.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a misunderstanding!

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:32.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were just trying to find a
fake girlfriend for Sunohara...

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:34.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey, do you think
I should ask Kyou?

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:36.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp] What, are you kidding me?

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
She just kicked your ass!

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:40.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I guess she's
no good, huh?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's probably for the best,

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:43.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
since she's so bossy
and mean and violent.

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:45.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
Really, more like a gorilla
than a girl...

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm standing right here,
you know.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:48.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smack]

00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:50.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Wanna say
that to my face?

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:52.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
As a reward for your courage,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll stick my hand
down your throat,

00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:55.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
rip out your vocal chords,
and stomp on them.

00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:57.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] I-I'm sorry.

  -[smack]
  -[Youhei screams]

00:07:58.667 --> 00:07:59.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
I said sorry!

00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:01.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laugh] I know,
but for some reason

00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:03.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
 that pissed
 me off even more.

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:04.901 position:27% line:83% align:start

[Tomoya groans]

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:07.033 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Let's go, Sis.

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:08.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
Their stupidity
might be contagious.

00:08:08.868 --> 00:08:10.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, okay...

00:08:12.334 --> 00:08:15.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Really, acting like
a bunch of primates...

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Men are so insensitive.

00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:18.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, see you later.

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
you're okay,Sunohara?

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:24.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
That looked like it
really hurt...

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:25.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
He'll be fine.

00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:27.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's had so much experience
getting beaten up by girls,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
he should be a real pro
at it by now.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't trivialize
my suffering!

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:33.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:35.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if both Fujibayashi
and Kyou turned you down,

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:38.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
then we're kind of running
out of options, aren't we?

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:39.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hm?

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:43.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Well, Tomoyo is sitting
 right over there.

00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:45.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Why don't you ask her?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?! For real?

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:49.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why not? I think she'd
make a great girlfriend.

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:51.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's pretty and caring
and smart...

00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:52.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
-I dunno, it might be dangerous.
-[Youhei stammers]

00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:54.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Look at him,
 he's freaking out...

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sh-shut up! Wh-who's
freaking out, huh?

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
  Think we should
  take him to a doctor?

00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:01.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sigh] Calm down.
Just take a deep breath, okay?

00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:06.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [rhythmic breaths]

00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:07.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, time to deliver!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
I really think we need
to go to the doctor!

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
We may seem like enemies,
but we're really

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
more like rivals
now that I think about it.

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:16.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even though we couldn't help
getting into fights

00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:18.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
all the time...

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:22.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:24.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not like you to look
so troubled.

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:27.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Heh. None of your business,
 little missy.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I suppose it isn't.

00:09:31.234 --> 00:09:32.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
But, you know...

00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:35.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're rivals,

00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:37.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that means I don't
want to see you lose

00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:39.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
to anyone but me.

00:09:42.434 --> 00:09:45.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
Over time, we recognized
each other's strengths...

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
and even if we fought,
deep down,

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:48.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
we had a mutual affection
for each other.

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
 That's so touching!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why I can't turn back!

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:53.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmph!

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:55.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
[nervous whimper]

00:09:55.534 --> 00:09:58.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tea stains are actually
a substance called tannin.

00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
Baking soda does the best
job of getting rid of them,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if you don't have any,
then you can just-

00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:08.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then you can just
use vinegar, instead.

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:10.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
Don't pretend
like I'm not here!

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sakagami, is this person
a friend of yours?

00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:15.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't make eye-contact with him;
he's highly unstable.

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:18.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
  Don't treat me like
  some kind of wild animal!

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:22.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Tomoyo, please, hear Sunohara
 out, just this once.

00:10:22.234 --> 00:10:23.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's Furukawa.

00:10:24.033 --> 00:10:26.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our game yesterday sure
was fun, wasn't it?

00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:31.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I'm so glad you came.
You were really cool out there!

00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:34.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
I called you "Furukawa"
instead of "Nagisa."

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's okay, right?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
Call me anything!
Whatever you like!

00:10:38.834 --> 00:10:41.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Could you two stop having your
little chat without me?!

00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:43.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're still here?
What was it you wanted?

00:10:43.767 --> 00:10:45.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
He has a little favor
to ask.

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:47.000 position:38% line:83% align:start
 You think you could
 hear him out a sec?

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Tomoyo sighs]

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
Playing baseball
with you is one thing,

00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:53.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
but going out of my way
for Sunohara is asking a lot.

00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:55.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Youhei sighs]

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
 I'm really troubled right now.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
Really? Because you look about
the same as usual to me.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
[scoff] It's none of your
business, little missy.

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:05.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] That's what
I'm saying. See ya.

00:11:05.367 --> 00:11:06.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
No! You're supposed to say,
"We're rivals,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that means I don't want to
see you lose to anyone but me!"

00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:12.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it. Why would I say
something I don't mean?

00:11:12.634 --> 00:11:15.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just say it!
Let me move on with my life!

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:11:17.434 --> 00:11:19.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're rivals, and that means

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:21.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to see you lose
to anyone but me.

00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:24.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmph! Who said
anything about losing?

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:25.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's settle this now.

[smack]

00:11:26.934 --> 00:11:28.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
If he wanted
to pick a fight,

00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:29.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
he should have
said so sooner.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
See you later,

[Kotomi] Okay, I understand.
I'll help.

-Really?

You're so sweet, Kotomi.
Thank you!

Of course! I'll do anything
I can to help my friends!

00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:52.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just tell me what to do and
I promise I'll make it happen!

Since you two are supposed to be
dating,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
why don't you try doing
normal couple stuff,

00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
like having fun together
and hanging out?

you got the violin repaired!

Yup! It sounds much better
than before, don't you think?

00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:16.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know about "better,"

[Nagisa] Are you sure
about this, Sunohara?

00:12:20.601 --> 00:12:23.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems like a waste
after she agreed to help...

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't make me go back there.
I don't have the guts.

00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:27.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't do it...

you can call me, you hear me?

00:13:40.434 --> 00:13:43.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
No matter where I am,
I'll come running.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
butyou can't go outside yet!
Come back!

00:13:45.634 --> 00:13:47.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
You still need to hide!

00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:50.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
[door opens, closes]

00:13:52.234 --> 00:13:54.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is it just me,
or was that really strange?

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:58.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Guess she's got her own
 problems to deal with, huh?

00:14:01.534 --> 00:14:04.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I'm sorry,
but I'd better head home.

00:14:04.234 --> 00:14:05.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hate to leave you guys,

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:07.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I need to help
my family make dinner.

00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:10.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, Sunohara...
good luck out there.

00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:14.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [sigh]

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
Guess I could use all
the luck I can get.

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:19.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] The problem is we're
expecting people

00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:21.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
to do something for nothing.

00:14:21.267 --> 00:14:23.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Maybe we could offer a reward.

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:25.501 position:50% line:83% align:start
Huh? But I don't
have any money!

00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:27.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't need money.

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:30.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
To win a girl's heart
all you need's a little charm.

00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:32.567 position:50% line:89% align:start
Huh! Good point!

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:34.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
First things first,
you gotta flatter her.

00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:37.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
After that, make her feel like
her secrets are safe with you,

00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:40.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
'cause girls these days just
love to keep secrets.

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Finally, you gotta hit
the peer-pressure angle.

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:45.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell her that all
the cool kids are into you.

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:48.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
  I got it!
  Let's give it a shot!

00:14:48.334 --> 00:14:49.968 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Hey there, Cutie!

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:51.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You got a sec?
-Huh?

00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:53.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Hey, just hear me out,
 all right?

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
I promise it'll
be worth your time.

00:14:55.434 --> 00:14:58.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
I got a part-time job offer
you just can't turn down.

00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:01.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I'm in
a hurry right now.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] Come on,
your secret's safe with me.

00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:05.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to use
your real name

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:06.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I won't tell
your parents, either.

00:15:06.968 --> 00:15:08.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's no need to be shy!

00:15:08.434 --> 00:15:10.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, all the
cool kids are doing it!

00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:12.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
[girl screams]

00:15:12.234 --> 00:15:14.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're making me sound
like some kinda sleazy pimp!

00:15:14.501 --> 00:15:15.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya grunts]

00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:16.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Sanae] Um...

00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:17.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh!

00:15:17.968 --> 00:15:19.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Sanae!

00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:22.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
You two look upset.
Is something troubling you?

00:15:22.968 --> 00:15:24.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hmm...

00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:26.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
But if all you need
is a fake girlfriend,

00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:28.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
then I wouldn't mind
helping you out.

00:15:28.734 --> 00:15:30.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
[both] What?!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
about this, Sanae?

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:33.901 position:38% line:83% align:start
As long as Mei
is staying with us,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
I consider her
part of the family.

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:36.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
If you're her brother,

00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:38.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
that means you're
part of the family, too.

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:41.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[gasp]
-H-h-hold on, time out!

00:15:41.501 --> 00:15:44.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, you said that was
Nagisa's older sister, right?

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:46.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Her sister?

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:49.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, I guess I did say
that yesterday, didn't I?

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.367 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, dude!
Nagisa's sister,
I can't believe it!

00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:55.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's totally hot, man,
I'm freaking out, here!

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>I think I'm gonna wait</i>
 <i>and see how this plays out.</i>

00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:00.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
 -[Sanae] Um...
 -[gasp]

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
  I'm sorry,
  am I not good enough?

00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:04.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not it at all!

00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:05.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if you pretended to be
his girlfriend,

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
wouldn't Mei figure out you were
faking it right off the bat?

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:12.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't worry, it'll be fine.
I'll just wear a disguise.

00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:14.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you serious
about this, Sanae?

00:16:14.701 --> 00:16:17.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sure. But you have
to take good care of me.

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:20.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei cheers]

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Tomoya sighs]

00:16:22.534 --> 00:16:25.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] What?!
You have a girlfriend?

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei] I sure do.

00:16:26.767 --> 00:16:28.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's pretty and responsible...

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with her!

00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:31.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
[shocked groan]

00:16:31.801 --> 00:16:34.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
As you can see, I have
direction in my life after all.

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:35.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nothing to worry about!

00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:37.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why, you might say

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm climbing the stairs to
adulthood one step at a time.

00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:42.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [Mei] Let me meet her.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have to introduce me to her!

00:16:44.467 --> 00:16:46.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
As your sister, I think
I deserve to meet the person

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:49.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
you want to spend
the rest of your life with!

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, no problem.

00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:53.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll see when she has
some time off.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:58.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
Goodness, the drama club

00:17:00.634 --> 00:17:03.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
sure has a lot of different
costumes, doesn't it?

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:05.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll be meeting up
with Mei in two days.

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:06.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
That gives us tomorrow
to rehearse

00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:08.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
your big date with Sunohara.

00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:10.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Right! I'm so excited!

00:17:10.734 --> 00:17:13.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm getting mixed feelings
about this whole thing.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if it's just pretend,

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
my mom is going
out with one of my classmates.

00:17:18.334 --> 00:17:20.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure you wanna go
through with this?

00:17:20.267 --> 00:17:21.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara's really
looking forward

00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:23.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
to the whole date thing,
you know.

00:17:23.434 --> 00:17:26.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
He thinks you're Nagisa's
older sister, not her mom.

00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:29.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
 [squeal] Nagisa's older sister?

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:31.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
That's such
a nice thing to say!

00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:33.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wasn't trying
to flatter you...

00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:34.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know, Mom.

00:17:34.968 --> 00:17:36.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you mean well and all,

00:17:36.334 --> 00:17:39.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
but maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't said anything, but
ever since the baseball game,

00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:45.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been thinking
about Sunohara.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
At first glance,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
he seems a little awkward
and irresponsible,

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
but deep down, I think
he's really a sweet boy.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
If someone was there to push him
in the right direction,

00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:57.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like he might be
able to turn his life around.

00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:00.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
That's why I want
to help him

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
 in any way that I can.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
I feel the same way.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're really serious
about helping him out,

00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:08.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to do my best
for Sunohara, too.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
Great! Then let's
all work together, okay?

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:13.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but one more thing.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's not mention
this to your old man.

00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:16.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
Know what I mean?

00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:18.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
 No, I don't get it.

00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:20.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh, well,
even if your mom

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:22.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
is just doing this
to help out Sunohara,

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
it might make your dad
kinda, uh...

00:18:25.067 --> 00:18:27.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
flip out and
pound his face in.

00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:30.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
So let's keep this
our little secret,

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
for Sunohara's safety, I mean.

00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:34.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [both] Ohh!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [Youhei stammering]

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think I've ever seen
Sunohara so nervous before.

00:18:41.501 --> 00:18:44.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
  For some reason,
  he's really pissing me off...

00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:46.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why would you be angry?

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:18:47.968 --> 00:18:49.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way, Tomoya,

00:18:49.434 --> 00:18:51.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
don't tell me you've fallen
in love with my mom, too?

00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:55.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Wh-what?! Come on,
 now that's just crazy talk!

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:56.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, um...

00:18:57.067 --> 00:18:58.367 position:72% line:89% align:start
Y-yes!

00:18:58.467 --> 00:19:00.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we're supposed to be
boyfriend and girlfriend,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
then we should be
on a first-name basis.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I'm going to call
you "Youhei," all right?

00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:07.234 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Yeah? Y-y-yeah!

00:19:07.334 --> 00:19:09.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] You're so cute.

00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:12.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope we can
have fun together!

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:14.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [squealing]

00:19:15.934 --> 00:19:19.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, man! She just said
I was cute, dude!

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:21.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's start by walking
side by side, okay?

00:19:22.033 --> 00:19:24.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
O-okay!

00:19:25.734 --> 00:19:27.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sanae giggles]

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] You can come
a little closer.

00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:33.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're a couple after all.

00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:37.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei shrieks]

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, man!
She smells awesome, dude!

00:19:40.534 --> 00:19:43.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
Should we hold hands?
Here, don't be shy.

00:19:43.634 --> 00:19:44.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shriek]

00:19:45.634 --> 00:19:47.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, man! Her hands
are way soft, dude!

00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:50.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya] I don't need
  a play-by play...

00:19:52.934 --> 00:19:54.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you really think all this

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
is gonna push him
in the right direction?

00:19:56.267 --> 00:19:59.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now I'm having mixed feelings
all over again...

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
  <i>And the day arrives.</i>

00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:10.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]
Sunohara's already waiting!

00:20:10.434 --> 00:20:13.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Mei, try calling out to him
and see what happens.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet he'll think
it's his girlfriend

00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:16.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
and get really nervous.

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:18.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Mei giggles]

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you put it that way,
you make it hard to resist!

00:20:24.167 --> 00:20:26.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
 [Mei] Have you
 been waiting long?

00:20:26.234 --> 00:20:27.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
[chuckle]
Of course not!

00:20:27.968 --> 00:20:29.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
A-actually, I just got here...

00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:30.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mei?!

00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:33.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I don't get it.
What's with all the cans?

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:36.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
All part of my plan.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
When she gets here,
she'll see all the cans...

00:20:38.901 --> 00:20:40.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
 And then...

00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:42.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] <i>Sunohara...</i>

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>You mean you've been waiting</i>
 <i>for me all this time?</i>

00:20:46.534 --> 00:20:48.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[swoon]
-Hmph!

00:20:48.801 --> 00:20:50.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Pretty clever trick, huh?

00:20:50.434 --> 00:20:52.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, you're
a real smooth operator.

00:20:52.801 --> 00:20:56.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's part of the deadly game
we all know too well.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
A game of love!

00:20:58.067 --> 00:20:59.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
A boy's love game,
you might say!

00:21:00.067 --> 00:21:01.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That means
something else, you know...

00:21:01.701 --> 00:21:06.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
Damn it! I drank too much!
Gotta take a potty break...

00:21:11.634 --> 00:21:14.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] This place is a mess.
We can't leave it like this.

00:21:14.834 --> 00:21:17.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, you're right.
I'll help clean it up.

00:21:17.767 --> 00:21:19.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Thanks.

00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:24.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Here, let me help too.

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:26.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Oh, uh, thank you.

00:21:26.567 --> 00:21:28.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, don't mention it.

00:21:29.634 --> 00:21:31.400 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:35.968 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:37.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
She looks so cute...

00:21:37.634 --> 00:21:40.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Hey, you're not staring at my
 mom and blushing, are you?

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.834 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [stammering]

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
[relieved sigh]
That's the stuff.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Oh... hi, Youhei!

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
[startled scream]

00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:50.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry! I didn't make you
wait, did I?

00:21:51.033 --> 00:21:52.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's fine.

00:21:53.234 --> 00:21:55.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, I just got here.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
[awkward laugh]

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:05.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is that really my
brother's girlfriend?

00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:42.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure is nice having someone
who cares for you, isn't it?

00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:44.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, where did this come from?

00:23:44.701 --> 00:23:46.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
I... I dunno.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I go after her, I might
end up missing Sanae's call...

00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:51.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but you can't tell
someone who to love.

00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:52.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
[uneasy chuckle]

00:23:52.801 --> 00:23:55.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, I said wait...

00:23:56.734 --> 00:23:58.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [frustrated grunt]

00:24:03.601 --> 00:24:05.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scoffs]
