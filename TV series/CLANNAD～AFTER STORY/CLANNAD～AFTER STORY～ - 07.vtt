 <i>but it felt like time</i>
 <i>had stopped.</i>

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:12.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>They shimmered so brightly</i>
 <i>I could almost feel</i>

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>their warmth</i>

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Along with the coming</i>

 <i>a few days ago,</i>

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:37.560 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>The clouds will eventually</i>
 <i>cover this world,</i>

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>and bury the Earth</i>

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.735 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>to make a decision.</i>

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.576 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, hello.

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.178 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've been here watching
over me, haven't you?

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:02.813 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [giggle]

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:05.149 position:50% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:12.021 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there something outside?

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.889 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you want to go see?

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:18.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
Careful. Winter's coming soon.

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:21.228 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it gets any colder
than it is now,

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:23.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
I won't be able to move anymore.

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:28.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
Also, if we leave
this house now,

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have a feeling we won't
be able to come back ever again.

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:34.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you still want to go?

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:38.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's out there? What do you
want to see so badly?

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:44.578 position:5% line:83% align:start
A place that's different
than this one?

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
A warm place full of secrets?

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:48.983 position:5% line:89% align:start
A world where every day is fun?

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:53.086 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:03:28.693 --> 00:03:31.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why is there a portable stove
in the reference room?

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:33.797 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] We have a lot more here
than just books

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:35.365 position:5% line:89% align:start
and reference materials.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
We also have a bunch
of random things

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:38.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
that people don't use anymore.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're smart, you're cute and
you're great at cooking too.

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:43.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
On top of that, you're
easy to get along with.

00:03:43.638 --> 00:03:45.006 position:38% line:83% align:start
Every time
I come to visit you,

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:47.509 position:27% line:83% align:start
it feels like all my
worries just fade away.

00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:49.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's very sweet of you to say.

00:03:49.143 --> 00:03:51.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems like the three
of you are always so cheery.

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:54.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yep! We're always finding
ways to have fun!

00:03:54.813 --> 00:03:56.014 position:27% line:89% align:start
What about you, Yukine?

00:03:56.114 --> 00:03:57.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're always holed up
in here by yourself;

00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.650 position:38% line:83% align:start
  doesn't it get
  boring sometimes?

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, not at all.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
How could I bored when I have
so many visitors all the time?

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:05.922 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Visitors, huh?

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:12.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>What the hell was</i>
 <i>that about, anyway?</i>

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] So why did you stop by?
What can I help you with?

00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:17.864 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yukine, I'm here
today to express

00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:20.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
my undying affection
for you!

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:23.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
Although it's only recently that
I became aware of my feelings...

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:25.371 position:5% line:89% align:start
this love cannot be denied!

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:27.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm flattered that you feel that
way.

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:30.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
However, I think you may be more
happy finding love with someone

00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:32.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
a bit better suited to you.

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:37.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just like Nagisa! Why do girls
have to turn me down so fast?!

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:38.581 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [groaning]

00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:40.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
B-Big Sis...

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:41.384 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:42.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Sudou!

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:50.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
Poor Sudou. Are you all right?

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:51.758 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [chuckle]

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.426 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I screwed up real bad.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:54.793 position:16% line:89% align:start
  Because of my stupid ass,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.695 position:27% line:83% align:start
all my bros got
slaughtered out there...

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:59.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
  I can't show my face to them,
  I'm too ashamed.

00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:02.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
  I'm leaving and
  never coming back here.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:06.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
This life is over for me.
From now on, I'm a lone wolf.

00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:10.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
But before I fade away,
I had to say goodbye.

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:12.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had to see your face
one last time.

00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:13.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [chuckle]

00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:16.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
So go ahead and laugh
at a what a pussy I am.

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:19.580 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, guys, this is still the
school's reference room, right?

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:20.646 position:27% line:89% align:start
So they say.

00:05:20.746 --> 00:05:22.014 position:5% line:89% align:start
He looks like he's really hurt!

00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:24.083 position:5% line:89% align:start
Should we call the school nurse?

00:05:25.218 --> 00:05:27.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, don't say
such terrible things.

00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:30.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you became a lone wolf
and faded away,

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:32.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
your bros would miss
you dearly, Sudou.

00:05:33.357 --> 00:05:34.624 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I would too.

00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:36.059 position:38% line:89% align:start
  You mean it, Sis?

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now watch and I'll teach you
a little charm.

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:40.262 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Do this...

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
 and this...

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:45.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now stay like that and chant,

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:48.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
"I'll always be watching
over you" three times.

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:51.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you do it, you'll be able
to make peace with your bros.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll always be
watching over you...

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:55.040 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'll always be
watching over you...

00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:57.942 position:38% line:83% align:start
 I'll always be
 watching over you.

00:05:59.644 --> 00:06:01.845 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like I have
the power to live again!

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
Quick to recover, isn't he?

00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:05.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, what a great charm.
I'll have to remember that one!

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:08.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now you just have to go
apologize to your bros.

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:10.553 position:5% line:89% align:start
No matter how scared you may be,

00:06:10.652 --> 00:06:12.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
you can't solve anything
by running away.

00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:14.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're right as usual,
Big Sis.

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:16.757 position:38% line:83% align:start
Heh. My heart got
all mixed up

00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:19.126 position:38% line:83% align:start
  and I dunno what
  I was thinking...

00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:24.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll always tell you, it's no
good to get in fights like that.

00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:26.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're right, but there are
times in a man's life

00:06:26.598 --> 00:06:29.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
when he's gotta use his fists
to speak for his heart.

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:31.936 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, guys, hate to interrupt,
but I'm kinda lost here,

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:33.538 position:5% line:89% align:start
could tell me what's going on?

00:06:33.638 --> 00:06:34.771 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:36.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
-The truth is-
-[Sudou] The truth is,

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:38.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yuki isn't just like
a big sister to our gang,

00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:39.775 position:38% line:89% align:start
she's like our boss.

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.177 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Your boss?

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:42.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like a real big sister,

00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:44.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
she's always looking out
for us guys.

00:06:44.212 --> 00:06:47.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
Patches us up,
body and soul, after a fight.

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:49.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
 -And it's not just us, but-
 -[window opens]

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.552 position:50% line:83% align:start
Figured I'd find
you here, Sudou.

00:06:51.652 --> 00:06:54.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, you're chasing me down, huh?

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
If you thought I'd
just let you go,

00:06:55.854 --> 00:06:57.088 position:38% line:83% align:start
you're even dumber
than you look!

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.790 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Let's do this!
-[Yukine] Wait, you two!

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry, Yukine.

00:07:01.426 --> 00:07:03.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the last person I wanna
see suffer from all this crap.

00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:06.564 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't even count the times
you've done favors for my pals.

00:07:06.664 --> 00:07:09.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
 [Sudou] I'm sorry too, Big Sis,
 but I can't back down.

00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:11.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
This fight is for
the sake of my bros

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.001 position:5% line:83% align:start
and for the sake of our honor!
We'll take this outside!

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna put my big sis
through any more trouble!

00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:20.440 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm with you on that one!
Bye, Yukine. Sorry again!

00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:24.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
Big Sis, there's one last thing.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
If another idiot like me
comes wandering in,

00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:28.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
then take good care
of him for me.

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:30.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
So long!

00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:32.450 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sudou, wait!

00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:40.523 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know this must seem
strange to you,

00:07:40.623 --> 00:07:43.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
but my older brother is actually
the leader of Sudou's gang.

00:07:43.892 --> 00:07:44.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now that you mention it,

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:47.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
you told me you had
a scary brother.

00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:49.630 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Right now,
there are two different gangs

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:52.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
fighting for dominance
in this town.

00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:56.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's the gang my brother
and Sudou come from,

00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:58.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
and there's the gang
the other man

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
in the leather jacket
belongs to.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
Their turf is separated
by the river.

00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:05.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ever since my brother became
the leader of Sudou's gang,

00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:09.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
the other gang has started to
lose ground and can't keep up.

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:12.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
Regardless, they still seem to
get into brawls with each other

00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:13.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
nearly every day.

00:08:13.748 --> 00:08:16.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
If your big brother could turn
the whole gang battle around,

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
he must be
a really tough guy, huh?

00:08:18.653 --> 00:08:19.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's hard to say,

00:08:19.886 --> 00:08:22.021 position:5% line:83% align:start
but apparently,
he's never lost a fight.

00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:24.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do know that he keeps his
identity and location a secret,

00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:27.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
so that the rival gang
can't ambush him.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ruling the gang
from the shadows?!

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's so cool!

00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:32.630 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] What's his name?

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, if it's not
a secret, of course.

00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:37.166 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] It's Kazuto.
Kazuto Miyazawa.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[boy] Don't move!
-[Yukine gasps]

00:08:38.735 --> 00:08:40.737 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Miyazawa?!
-You're Yukine, aren't you?!

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:42.371 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give me back my sister!

00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:43.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you trying to pull?!

00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:45.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you in the same gang
as that guy who...

00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:46.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:50.110 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [straining]

00:08:51.544 --> 00:08:55.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine, Okazaki.
I can handle this on my own.

00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
There we go.

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:59.984 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ahh! What are you doing?!

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:02.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
Put me down! Let me go!

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's just talk this
through, now shall we?

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:14.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
So this sister of yours that you
mentioned, do I know her?

00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:17.197 position:38% line:83% align:start
Don't play dumb!
I know who you are!

00:09:17.298 --> 00:09:19.066 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know you're in charge
of all those gangs!

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:22.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Don't act like such
a big-shot, you little twerp.

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:24.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Who are you?!

00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:28.240 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! You're Kazuto Miyazawa,
aren't you?!

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.974 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-I see.

00:09:30.074 --> 00:09:32.243 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've got blonde hair
just like the rumors say!

00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:34.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the boss
on this side of the river, huh?

00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:35.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
The guy who calls all the shots?

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:37.414 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [chuckle]

00:09:37.514 --> 00:09:41.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
You got it, kid.
I'm Kazuto Miyazawa, all right.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
  [Yukine]
  Wait... but, uh...

00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:44.952 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, no, worry not,
sweet sister.

00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:46.887 position:38% line:83% align:start
Let big brother
take care of this.

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:49.990 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm the man who rules
this town from the shadows.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.292 position:38% line:83% align:start
You touch Yukine,
you answer to me!

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.660 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [angry grunt]

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it.
What's he doing?

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.064 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's just a lame excuse
to look tough.

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:01.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the rare event that he finds
someone weaker than him,

00:10:01.398 --> 00:10:03.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
he can't wait
to rub it in their face.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.502 position:16% line:89% align:start
Um, hey...

00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:06.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why don't we find a nice,

00:10:06.869 --> 00:10:09.572 position:27% line:83% align:start
quiet place to talk
this through, okay?

00:10:11.606 --> 00:10:14.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] I still don't see why
we had to come to my room...

00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:17.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
A bigshot like you shouldn't
sweat the small stuff.

00:10:17.178 --> 00:10:19.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, you said
your name was Yuu, right?

00:10:19.412 --> 00:10:22.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
I suppose I never had the chance
to properly introduce myself.

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:25.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
As you guessed,
my name is Yukine Miyazawa.

00:10:25.883 --> 00:10:26.951 position:27% line:89% align:start
A pleasure to meet you.

00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:28.687 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pleased to meet you.

00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:33.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now these are my friends, Tomoya
Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa.

00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:35.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pleased to meet you.

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:38.694 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have great manners,
Yuu, I'm impressed.

00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:40.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
F-flattery will get you nowhere!

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:42.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
What a letdown.
I was hoping for violence

00:10:42.798 --> 00:10:44.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I get a nice
little chat instead.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:46.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Now, Yuu, when we met earlier,

00:10:46.601 --> 00:10:48.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
 you said something about
 me returning your sister?

00:10:48.736 --> 00:10:52.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, my sister ran away
from home and joined your gang.

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:55.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
My best friend's big brother
said the gang was run by the

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
Miyazawas and that one of them
went to Hikarisaka High School.

00:10:58.377 --> 00:11:01.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I went there to check it out
and sure enough, I ran into you.

00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:03.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you're willing
to fight a gang boss

00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:04.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
to get your sister back?

00:11:04.715 --> 00:11:06.949 position:16% line:83% align:start
Aw, what a good boy!
You're so brave!

00:11:07.049 --> 00:11:08.317 position:16% line:89% align:start
I heard that Kazuto Miyazawa

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.085 position:38% line:83% align:start
gives his orders
from the shadows,

00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:12.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that no one outside of his
gang has ever seen his face.

00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:14.756 position:27% line:83% align:start
  I figured looking for
  him was a lost cause,

00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:17.692 position:50% line:83% align:start
so I came to his
sister instead.

00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:19.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
How old's this sister
of yours, anyway?

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:23.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh... pretty sure she's 21.

00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I got a
phone call from her.

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:29.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
She said she was renting
out an apartment

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:31.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that she wouldn't
be coming home for a while.

00:11:32.035 --> 00:11:34.904 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Uh, is that
something to be worried about?

00:11:35.406 --> 00:11:36.439 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Oh jeez...

00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:38.940 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look, kid, you've
got a sister complex.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sister, what?

00:11:40.175 --> 00:11:41.743 position:5% line:89% align:start
  When a 21-year-old moves out,

00:11:41.844 --> 00:11:43.378 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's not called
"running away from home,"

00:11:43.478 --> 00:11:45.312 position:27% line:83% align:start
it's called "becoming
independent."

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.614 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's no big deal.

00:11:46.714 --> 00:11:48.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah? Well it's
a big deal when

00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:50.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
she's going out
with some gangster thug!

00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:51.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen...

00:11:51.718 --> 00:11:53.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
while it may be true
that my friends are in a gang

00:11:53.686 --> 00:11:56.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it may be true that they
have a bad reputation,

00:11:56.288 --> 00:11:58.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
that doesn't mean
they're bad people.

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:00.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're a bit short-tempered
and they fight an awful lot,

00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:03.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
but they're also chivalrous
in a manly sort of way.

00:12:03.895 --> 00:12:07.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What about us? Do we
look like bad people to you?

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.198 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuu] You do.

00:12:09.298 --> 00:12:11.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this lady
looks nice enough, I guess.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
Aw, that's sweet, Yuu.
Thank you very much.

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:16.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not cute, kid...

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.206 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yuu, you're like a
floating dandelion seed.

00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:20.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:22.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
Carried away by the wind on
an incredible journey.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:26.378 position:5% line:83% align:start
You'll go to new places and meet
wonderful new people as well.

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:29.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
Carried away by the wind...
to new places and new people?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't be dependent
on your sister

00:12:31.816 --> 00:12:32.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
for the rest of your life.

00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:34.585 position:5% line:89% align:start
Although you may be apart,

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:35.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
you still share a bond.

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:38.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's what being
family is all about!

00:12:38.555 --> 00:12:39.588 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:41.623 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That's a pretty
impressive lecture,

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:43.024 position:27% line:89% align:start
coming from him.

00:12:43.124 --> 00:12:45.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
He just went through some
sister troubles himself.

00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:47.495 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he's given this sort
of thing a lot of thought.

00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:49.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yuu, I'm sure you're
still worried about

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:51.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
where your sister ran off to.

00:12:51.298 --> 00:12:52.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll try talking
to some of my friends

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:55.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
to see if anyone knows where
she's staying right now.

00:12:55.401 --> 00:12:57.435 position:16% line:89% align:start
Does that sound good to you?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, thanks.

00:13:02.105 --> 00:13:04.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
I really hope you can
find my sister for me.

00:13:04.808 --> 00:13:06.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you, Yukine.

00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:09.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right. I promise I'll
give it everything I've got.

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
Somehow, looks like
everything worked out nicely.

00:13:12.247 --> 00:13:13.782 position:16% line:89% align:start
Miyazawa's so easygoing,

00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:15.717 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't think anyone
can stay mad at her!

00:13:15.817 --> 00:13:17.984 position:27% line:5% align:start
 She's really something!

00:13:21.987 --> 00:13:24.858 position:5% line:83% align:start
Remind me, why is
this happening again?

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yuu here is gonna follow
me around today

00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:28.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
and learn what it means
to be a real man.

00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:30.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's got spirit,
I'll tell you that much.

00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:32.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
He even skipped school!

00:13:32.128 --> 00:13:33.430 position:5% line:89% align:start
Teach me your secrets, Master!

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.465 position:38% line:83% align:start
Sure, just watch
and learn, kid.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I like to teach by example.
 You ready to man up?

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:39.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.504 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:47.307 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [schoolbell rings]

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:49.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
Master, I think
the bell just rang.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.210 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah. I guess it did.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.012 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't class starting?

00:13:54.012 --> 00:13:55.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
As long as you do what
you're supposed to do,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.949 position:50% line:83% align:start
you don't need
to go to class.

00:13:57.048 --> 00:13:58.783 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Got it?
 That's rule number one.

00:13:58.884 --> 00:14:00.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
Does he do what
he's supposed to do?

00:14:01.085 --> 00:14:03.186 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Not even close.
-Neither do you!

00:14:03.287 --> 00:14:04.722 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll have you know
I've been going to class

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:06.189 position:27% line:89% align:start
every day for weeks.

00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:08.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just hanging around
because you two need my help.

00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:09.959 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you don't go to class,

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
does that mean you guys
are deadbeats?

00:14:11.426 --> 00:14:13.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
One of us is a deadbeat,
but it's not me.

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't say that out loud!

00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:17.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're ruining my reputation
as an educator!

00:14:17.264 --> 00:14:19.165 position:27% line:83% align:start
What exactly were
you teaching him again?

00:14:19.266 --> 00:14:21.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've heard of a negative
exemplum, right?

00:14:21.434 --> 00:14:23.904 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was using that kind
technique to teach him.

00:14:24.004 --> 00:14:26.104 position:38% line:83% align:start
Uh, do you even know
what that means?

00:14:26.204 --> 00:14:28.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not really,
I just heard it on TV.

00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:30.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it sure does
sound cool, doesn't it?

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:34.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, I think someone's coming.

00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:36.712 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is somebody in here? Ah.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.753 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gimme a break. That's the best
hiding spot he could find?

00:14:49.857 --> 00:14:52.057 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Class is already starting.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I was playing
hide-and-seek

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:55.028 position:5% line:89% align:start
with some friends of mine

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:56.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I guess I lost
track of the time...

00:14:56.728 --> 00:14:58.030 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hide-and-seek?

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.032 position:38% line:83% align:start
And where are your
friends right now?

00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:03.166 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey! Okazaki!
It's time for class!

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:06.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
Little bastard.

00:15:06.469 --> 00:15:08.337 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] What happened?
Did you get in trouble?

00:15:08.437 --> 00:15:10.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nah, not really. They just
dragged us to the office

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
and lectured us
half to death.

00:15:12.407 --> 00:15:13.975 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wasn't about
to take one for the team

00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:15.543 position:38% line:83% align:start
when he was
skipping class, too.

00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:18.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, is this supposed
to teach me how to be a man?

00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:21.614 position:5% line:83% align:start
As a negative exemplum,
I'd say he's doing a great job.

00:15:21.714 --> 00:15:23.249 position:61% line:89% align:start
Gee, thanks!

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:26.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
Good news; I was able
to get in touch with them.

00:15:26.484 --> 00:15:28.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not only that,
they know where Yuu's sister

00:15:28.653 --> 00:15:29.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
is staying right now.

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
[excited laughs]

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:34.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your sister wants
to see you too,

00:15:34.992 --> 00:15:37.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
so we can stop by
right now if you want.

00:15:37.427 --> 00:15:39.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
The place where she hangs out
isn't too far from here,

00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:41.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I'd be happy
to show you the way.

00:15:41.463 --> 00:15:43.397 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thanks a lot, Yukine,
you're the best!

00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:46.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
Good for him, but we don't
have to tag along, do we?

00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:49.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna get stuck in
the middle of another big fight.

00:15:49.102 --> 00:15:52.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure the big shadow boss
could handle a brawl just fine.

00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:54.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Isn't that right, Kazuto?

00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:57.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
If some bad guys show up, I know
you can beat them, Kazuto!

00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:58.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not scared!

00:15:58.343 --> 00:15:59.677 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [awkward chuckle]

00:15:59.777 --> 00:16:02.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it might not hurt
to be a little scared.

00:16:10.585 --> 00:16:13.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm worried. I've never been
to a place like this...

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:15.991 position:27% line:83% align:start
No need to worry.
They may look tough,

00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:17.825 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I assure you they're
all quite kind.

00:16:17.925 --> 00:16:19.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just thought of something.

00:16:19.459 --> 00:16:21.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
As soon as those thugs see me,
Yuu is gonna find out

00:16:21.527 --> 00:16:23.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I'm not really Yukine's
brother after all!

00:16:23.663 --> 00:16:25.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
Really? It took you that
long to realize that?

00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:27.231 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm leaving!

00:16:27.331 --> 00:16:30.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
You dug your own grave.
Now let's go.

00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:32.402 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hello, everyone!

00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:34.404 position:61% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:16:34.504 --> 00:16:36.205 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Big Sis!
-Hey, what's up?

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:37.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
Long time no see, Sis!

00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:40.376 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems like all of you
are doing well!

00:16:41.142 --> 00:16:42.878 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [gasp] There you are!

00:16:42.978 --> 00:16:44.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yuu!

00:16:47.347 --> 00:16:49.516 position:38% line:83% align:start
I was so worried!
Why'd you run away?!

00:16:49.616 --> 00:16:52.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I know
you must've been scared,

00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:53.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I'm doing fine.

00:16:53.486 --> 00:16:55.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is this kid your little brother?
He's adorable!

00:16:55.921 --> 00:16:58.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
He may be a pipsqueak now, but
he's got the look of a real man.

00:16:58.957 --> 00:17:01.425 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you say we all celebrate
with a round of drinks?

00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:03.292 position:16% line:89% align:start
 No alcohol. He's underage.

00:17:03.394 --> 00:17:05.095 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Oh, is he? That's a shame.

00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:06.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sudou's here!

00:17:06.596 --> 00:17:08.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess that means
he was able to make peace

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
with all the guys!

00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:11.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
I still can't believe
how popular Miyazawa is.

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:14.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's no surprise, since
Big sis Yuki takes care of folks

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
no matter what side
of the fight they're on.

00:17:16.637 --> 00:17:18.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
 I can't even count
 how many times

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:20.240 position:38% line:83% align:start
 she's saved my ass
 when I was hurt.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, wait... I know you.

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:24.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Sorry I couldn't
introduce myself back then.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:25.978 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I was having a tough time.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:28.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine.
We know it's not your fault.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.714 position:61% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:17:29.814 --> 00:17:32.016 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do I see someone else
hiding over there?

00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:33.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
[deeper voice] Ah... no...

00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:35.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
No one worth mentioning
at least.

00:17:36.652 --> 00:17:37.553 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:17:37.653 --> 00:17:39.588 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [whimpering]

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.626 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hmm? Hey, Kazuto,
what are you doing?

00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:46.593 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:48.896 --> 00:17:49.997 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wh-What?

00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:51.831 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [screaming]

00:17:52.598 --> 00:17:54.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
Little punk.

00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:56.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
You trying to make a move
on our big sis Yuki?!

00:17:56.334 --> 00:17:58.636 position:16% line:83% align:start
No sir! No sir!
I'm just a friend, I swear!

00:17:58.737 --> 00:18:02.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
Does that mean he's not
Kazuto Miyazawa after all?

00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:04.874 position:27% line:83% align:start
No way! You were lying
all this time?!

00:18:04.974 --> 00:18:08.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
L-look, guys, it's a Drama
Club thing, that's all.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I was just honing
my craft for a play!

00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:13.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
 What gives you the right to
 throw around Kazuto's name?

00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:15.049 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Arrogant prick!

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:16.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you weren't pals
with our big sis,

00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:18.719 position:5% line:83% align:start
we'd string you up
and hang you out to dry!

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:22.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, you guys. I owe him for
looking after my little brother.

00:18:22.155 --> 00:18:24.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
If nothing else, can you forgive
him for my sake, can't you?

00:18:24.857 --> 00:18:27.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, it looks like
he's really sorry.

00:18:27.225 --> 00:18:28.293 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [whimpering]

00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:29.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
You guys are like
family to me!

00:18:29.894 --> 00:18:32.529 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll never forget this!

00:18:32.629 --> 00:18:36.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yesterday, I had a long talk
with Yuu before he went home.

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:37.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
He said his parents
and his sister

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:40.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
weren't getting along very well
before she moved out.

00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:42.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
Apparently, his mother
and his sister

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:44.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
got into a big fight
about something,

00:18:44.605 --> 00:18:47.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that was why she decided
to leave the house.

00:18:47.108 --> 00:18:49.442 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was no surprise.

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:51.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
Many of the people here
aren't on good terms

00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:52.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
with their parents.

00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:55.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
They don't feel like they belong
with their family,

00:18:55.614 --> 00:18:58.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
so make a new home for
themselves in places like this.

00:18:58.916 --> 00:19:01.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
 They may look like a gang to
 some people, but to each other,

00:19:01.753 --> 00:19:03.787 position:27% line:83% align:start
they're probably more
like family, right?

00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:05.421 position:5% line:89% align:start
My brother felt that way.

00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:07.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was never very close
to our parents,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
so he had to find
somewhere to belong.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Someone once told me
that you need a family

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
to keep yourself
on the right path.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
In her case, she didn't mean
your real family, either.

00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:20.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
She was on bad terms
with her parents, too.

00:19:20.767 --> 00:19:23.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
They had just gone
through a messy divorce.

00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:26.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
 [Yukine] What happened to her?
 Is she all right now?

00:19:27.005 --> 00:19:28.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
She went through a lot,

00:19:28.606 --> 00:19:31.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it seems like her family
is on good terms these days.

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:34.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
  I see... That's good to hear.

00:19:35.845 --> 00:19:38.747 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was wrong, you're a pretty
funny guy after all.

00:19:38.847 --> 00:19:40.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
Y-you think so?

00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:41.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Here you go.

00:19:41.884 --> 00:19:44.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Huh? Oh...thank you.
-Thanks, it looks delicious!

00:19:44.285 --> 00:19:46.353 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You're welcome.
-So, uh...

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:49.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
Will Kazuto be stopping by?
I'd like to meet him.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, my brother is...

00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:53.559 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid Kazuto is in
the hospital right now.

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:57.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
He was hit by a car when he was
trying to save one of his bros.

00:19:57.395 --> 00:19:58.930 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, sorry to hear that...

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.364 position:27% line:89% align:start
Before he got hurt,

00:20:00.464 --> 00:20:02.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kazuto used to do some
work for the barkeep here.

00:20:02.533 --> 00:20:04.201 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now we're taking care
of the place for him

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.302 position:27% line:89% align:start
 until he can come back.

00:20:06.402 --> 00:20:07.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
We do what we can.

00:20:07.837 --> 00:20:09.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
I help out in the kitchen
whenever I have the time.

00:20:09.838 --> 00:20:13.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
  The more I hear about Kazuto,
  the more I want to meet him.

00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:14.242 position:38% line:89% align:start
He sounds wonderful!

00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:15.442 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:20:15.543 --> 00:20:17.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kazuto's like a brother
to all of us.

00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:18.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
He doesn't just
hold us together,

00:20:18.812 --> 00:20:20.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
he helps keep us on track, too.

00:20:20.547 --> 00:20:21.948 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you have a picture handy?

00:20:22.048 --> 00:20:24.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm kinda curious
to see what he looks like.

00:20:24.383 --> 00:20:26.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid I don't
have any pictures.

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:27.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
But if it's any consolation,

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
people are always
telling me that we look alike.

00:20:31.354 --> 00:20:32.656 position:50% line:89% align:start
Is that true?

00:20:32.756 --> 00:20:33.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:20:33.824 --> 00:20:34.958 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:20:39.528 --> 00:20:41.429 position:5% line:89% align:start
That sure was fun, wasn't it?

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:43.998 position:5% line:83% align:start
Think I had a few years
shaved off my life...

00:20:44.098 --> 00:20:45.399 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, look on the bright side.

00:20:45.499 --> 00:20:46.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
You got a taste of
what it feels like

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
to be a big shadow boss, right?

00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:52.972 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Kazuto Miyazawa!

00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:54.207 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh? M-me?

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:56.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
So we finally get
to see your face, huh?

00:20:56.441 --> 00:20:58.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
Didn't know you were
out of the hospital!

00:20:58.409 --> 00:21:00.344 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll make you sorry
you ever crossed us!

00:21:00.444 --> 00:21:01.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Y-you got it all wrong!

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone, wait! This isn't him!

00:21:03.446 --> 00:21:05.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, Yukine, but there's
no stopping us now!

00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:08.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
Careful, guys, don't hurt Yukine
or the other girl. Go!

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:11.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is bad. Run away!

00:21:11.253 --> 00:21:12.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Ah! Wait!

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Hey, get back here!
-[thugs yelling]

00:21:18.226 --> 00:21:20.392 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[numerous punches]
-[thugs scream]

00:21:20.492 --> 00:21:23.162 position:50% line:83% align:start
What the hell
just happened?

00:21:23.263 --> 00:21:26.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
Was that really...
Kazuto Miyazawa?

00:21:26.497 --> 00:21:27.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's a monster...

00:21:27.832 --> 00:21:30.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
  No human is that strong...

00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:33.971 position:50% line:83% align:start
Picking a fight
was bad enough.

00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:36.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't have to
insult me on top of that.

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:40.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Thanks, Tomoyo!
You saved us!

00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:41.543 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, thanks.

00:21:41.643 --> 00:21:42.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
But what the heck
are you doing here?

00:21:43.078 --> 00:21:45.280 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard there have been
a lot of violent incidents

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:46.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
happening around here lately.

00:21:46.981 --> 00:21:49.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought it would be bad if one
of our students got involved,

00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:51.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I was patrolling the area.

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:52.819 position:5% line:89% align:start
But never mind that.

00:21:52.919 --> 00:21:55.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why would a bunch of gang
members be targeting you guys?

00:21:55.187 --> 00:21:58.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a long story; I don't
quite know where to start...

00:22:00.423 --> 00:22:02.293 position:38% line:83% align:start
So now that they got
the wrong idea,

00:22:02.392 --> 00:22:04.027 position:16% line:89% align:start
 what are we supposed to do?

00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:05.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's a good question.

00:22:05.394 --> 00:22:06.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:23:44.372 --> 00:23:45.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
What about your brother?

00:23:45.973 --> 00:23:47.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
Does he even know what's
going on right now?

00:23:47.808 --> 00:23:49.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure he's in the hospital,

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:52.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he can still reason with his
gang over the phone, can't he?

00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:55.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] If I were you, I would
stop all this silly fighting

00:23:55.513 --> 00:23:57.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
and resolve your differences
while you still can.

00:23:57.716 --> 00:24:00.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't, then both
sides are going to suffer.

00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:07.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] If Kazuto told them
to stop fighting,

00:24:07.457 --> 00:24:09.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
they'd listen, right?
