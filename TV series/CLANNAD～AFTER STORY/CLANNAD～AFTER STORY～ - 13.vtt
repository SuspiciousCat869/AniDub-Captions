00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry Tomoya. Akio
must have sneaked out

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:07.394 position:16% line:89% align:start
while I wasn't looking.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:09.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know him, he's always
running off to play.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:12.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's a shame. I really
needed to talk to him.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.369 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry about your father.
That must be hard on you.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm fine. I'm the one
who should be sorry.

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:20.140 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: Don't say that.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.376 position:10% line:83% align:start
None of us feel that way...
not me, not Akio,

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:25.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
and certainly not Nagisa.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.213 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wish everyone else
was like that.

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:31.216 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who knows if I'll ever get
a job offer that good again.

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:32.952 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair.

00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:36.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
If your life can change once, it
can change again for the better.

00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:38.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, I'm sure Nagisa
will follow you to the end,

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:42.060 position:13% line:83% align:start
no matter how many twists
and turns your life might take.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah. That's what she told me...

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:47.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
If she says she'll stay
with you... she means it.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks for your support.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.168 position:19% line:89% align:start
(good-natured chuckle)

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:51.769 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you two waiting!

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.871 position:19% line:83% align:start
There! Maybe some tea
will cheer you up!

00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:55.140 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.041 position:7% line:89% align:start
@Speaking of cheering you up;

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.310 position:13% line:77% align:start
@I just made a new kind of
breadúl can't wait for you to
try out!

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.012 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wait right here,
I'll go get some.

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.583 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: Oh? My little
princess came to visit?

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:08.685 position:13% line:89% align:start
Visit? I still live here!

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.187 position:10% line:89% align:start
Playing baseball, as usual?

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:13.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
I do other stuff! Anyway,
what are YOU doing here?

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:14.624 position:16% line:89% align:start
I called you, remember?

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
I said I was stopping by
for something important.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
Buying bread's not that
big of a deal.

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.262 position:7% line:89% align:start
You don't have to call ahead.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:22.132 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who said I came here
to buy bread?

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:23.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hate to break it to you, kid,

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.068 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you're not getting
a discount just cause

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:26.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're my daughter's boyfriend.

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:28.437 position:24% line:83% align:start
Actually, I should
charge you double!

00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:30.506 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, except for
Sanae's bread...

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:32.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can have her's
for the regular price.

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.777 position:7% line:89% align:start
@Dad, Mom'súright behind you.

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:38.781 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, I see how it is now...
my bread's nothing but...

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's nothing but
regular price to you!

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait! Is regular price
all that bad!?

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.420 position:21% line:89% align:start
He doesn't mean it!

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:49.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
(muffled) I love your bread!

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:50.992 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Old Man!

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:52.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need to talk to you,
all right? It's important.

00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:57.430 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see. So that's
why you're here.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.866 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. A man-to-man talk.

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.869 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right, in that case...

00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:07.373 position:24% line:89% align:start
We'll have a duel.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.532 position:10% line:83% align:start
(wicked chuckle) You're long
overdue for a beatdown.

00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:48.168 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why did I agree to this again?

00:03:48.168 --> 00:03:50.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come on, I'll show you why
everyone in the neighborhood

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:52.538 position:33% line:83% align:start
calls me the
bread-baking Cy Young!

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:55.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here comes my hundred
mile an hour fastball!

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:56.743 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hit it if you can!

00:03:56.743 --> 00:03:57.944 position:10% line:89% align:start
@You know about my shoulder!

00:03:57.944 --> 00:03:59.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Why do you alwaysúmake
me do this crap?

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:02.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
So says the guy who got
the game-winning hit

00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:03.716 position:16% line:89% align:start
the last time we played.

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen... I'm not saying
you gotta hit a home run.

00:04:05.952 --> 00:04:08.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just saying you gotta
hit something, all right?

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:12.090 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Akio]: As long as it ain't a
grounder or a pop fly, you're
good.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.992 position:24% line:89% align:start
You win the duel.

00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:15.894 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure those are the rules
you wanna play by?

00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:18.196 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah. If you win,
then I'll listen

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.098 position:10% line:89% align:start
to whatever you have to say.

00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:21.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
@[Tomoya]ÚListening
isn't@good enough.

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
@You have to agree to
whateverúl say; No objections.

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:30.741 position:41% line:89% align:start
Tomo-

00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:37.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, fine.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.251 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you score a solid hit, I'll
do anything and won't complain.

00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:43.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if I win, I ain't listening
to a single word you say.

00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:45.155 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Akio]: Fair enough?

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:45.889 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.657 position:19% line:89% align:start
Heh. Sounds like fun.

00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:49.826 position:27% line:89% align:start
Here we go, kid!

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:15.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lemme know when you're
ready to lose again!

00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:18.119 position:30% line:89% align:start
[robust laugh]

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:22.023 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you all right?

00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:23.458 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:25.026 position:7% line:89% align:start
@What the hell was I thinking?

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:27.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
@This is too important to betúon
a stupid game of baseball.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:31.999 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]ÚDon't give up yet. If
you work hard enough, you can do
it.

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:38.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stand up and keep fighting. You
have to win for Nagisa's sake!

00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:49.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's with this
all of a sudden?

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:52.551 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been challenged to a
duel to decide my future!

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:53.886 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh...?

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:58.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hmph. This kid doesn't
know when to quit, does he?

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:00.859 position:27% line:89% align:start
You can do it...

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:03.695 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on boys, show us a
good fight out there!

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:07.433 position:13% line:77% align:start
@My forkball drops a solid
meter, better keep your eyes
open!

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
What, are you a pro?

00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:20.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
@[robust laugh]úBetter
luck next time!

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why the hell do I
have to play in the rain?

00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:27.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
Couldn't this wait
until tomorrow!?

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:30.220 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is a duel. I don't care
if it's rain or shine!

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.823 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, you two! I'll get
a bath ready when you're done!

00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:36.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
All you're doing
is wasting my time.

00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:37.727 position:16% line:89% align:start
This's your last chance.

00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:39.295 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then let's do it.

00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:54.444 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Akio]: You can't win.

00:06:54.444 --> 00:06:56.778 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's tough, but sometimes,
you gotta face the facts.

00:06:56.778 --> 00:06:58.914 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm better than you, kid.

00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:05.253 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:07:05.253 --> 00:07:09.558 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he knows by now.
I can tell.

00:07:09.558 --> 00:07:11.460 position:19% line:89% align:start
He knows? Knows what?

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.695 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's like he's saying...
I'm still just a kid.

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:16.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
This isn't a fight
I can win right now.

00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:19.166 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was stupid to think
I could protect anyone;

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I still have
a long way to go.

00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.104 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think you're reading
into it too much.

00:07:23.104 --> 00:07:26.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
Akio always acts like that;
Don't take it personally.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.442 position:24% line:83% align:start
C'mon... I'll make
you a nice bath.

00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:30.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: No. Not yet.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.945 position:7% line:89% align:start
If I can't beat him in skill,

00:07:31.945 --> 00:07:33.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll just have to
beat him in willpower.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.082 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna stay and practice.

00:07:36.082 --> 00:07:36.815 position:38% line:89% align:start
But you-

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:38.251 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: He's right.

00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:39.052 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't encourage him!

00:07:39.052 --> 00:07:41.321 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know this is important to you.

00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:44.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you're determined to keep
fighting, then I won't stop you.

00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:45.924 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.993 position:24% line:83% align:start
@At any rate, I'm
goingúback to the bakery

00:07:47.993 --> 00:07:51.330 position:7% line:83% align:start
@to make a bath for Akio.úYou
come along too, Nagisa.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.898 position:38% line:89% align:start
But I...

00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:54.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nagisa... when two men
are dueling for their lives,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
you have to stand back
and respect that, okay?

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.005 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess so...

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa?

00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:33.202 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh! Dad...

00:08:38.307 --> 00:08:39.707 position:35% line:89% align:start
Old man...

00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:42.810 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sure is coming down hard.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
Guess it's another
rainy autumn, huh?

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:52.987 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hit or miss, this is the last
pitch you're gonna get. Ready?

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.474 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tomoya!

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:16.842 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: Homerun!

00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:24.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
Give me Nagisa's
hand in marriage!

00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.964 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look at that, just like
me, when I was that age.

00:09:38.964 --> 00:09:41.032 position:24% line:83% align:start
Really honey, I've
known you were alike

00:09:41.032 --> 00:09:43.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
since I first met him!
You're two of a kind!

00:09:43.802 --> 00:09:47.038 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio]: I was in a hurry to grow
up, @even though I didn't know
why.

00:09:47.038 --> 00:09:49.174 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess kids never learn, do they?

00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:51.942 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: All the more reason
you should understand.

00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:54.845 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Akio]: Pick your head up.

00:09:57.414 --> 00:09:59.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you ever make my
little girl suffer,

00:09:59.283 --> 00:10:01.051 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I'm taking her
back from you.

00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.053 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't want to
test me on that, kid.

00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:04.622 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then, you mean...

00:10:04.622 --> 00:10:06.022 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Dad...

00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:12.495 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: Tomoya...

00:10:12.495 --> 00:10:14.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nagisa isn't just our
daughter, she's our hope.

00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:17.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I want you to know...
that from today on,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're a part of that hope, too.

00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:23.206 position:7% line:83% align:start
So never forget-your happiness
is our happiness as well.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:27.009 position:24% line:83% align:start
In other words...
try your best to be happy, okay?

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:38.153 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Before long,
autumn changed into winter.

00:10:40.322 --> 00:10:42.290 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since I didn't have
to work on Christmas,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nagisa and I spent
the day together.

00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:00.541 position:10% line:83% align:start
Feel like I've beenúwaiting
for this all my life!

00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.044 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Akio]ÚThe day I can finally
have@a drink with my daughter!

00:11:04.044 --> 00:11:06.079 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is your first time
drinking sake, huh?

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:09.115 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes. It's a new
experience for me.

00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:15.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nagisa... no need
to force yourself, okay?

00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:19.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I can have one cup at least.
I have to... for dad's sake.

00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:23.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Nagisa... You have
noúidea how proud I am

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:24.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
@to call youúmy daughter!

00:11:24.263 --> 00:11:26.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Booze really means a lot to you.

00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:28.233 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here I go.

00:11:29.468 --> 00:11:32.437 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Akio]:
Whoo! Just look at her go!

00:11:32.437 --> 00:11:34.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
[hearty chuckle]

00:11:37.475 --> 00:11:40.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh... you look dizzy,
are you all right?

00:11:43.348 --> 00:11:47.452 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey Tomoya... you're so far
away; And why are you spinning?

00:11:47.452 --> 00:11:48.452 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:56.293 position:13% line:89% align:start
I like you up close. Yeah.

00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:57.327 position:10% line:89% align:start
@You're drunkúalready, huh?

00:11:57.327 --> 00:11:59.529 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not drunk, how dare you!

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:02.366 position:10% line:83% align:start
@I hate to break it to you,
úbut that's what all drunks say.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.401 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:08.070 position:10% line:89% align:start
You two are so lovey-dovey!

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't think lovey-dovey
is the word for this!

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:11.407 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tomoya!

00:12:11.407 --> 00:12:12.708 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, Yes?

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:14.610 position:10% line:83% align:start
I see you staring at my mom!
You cut that out!

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.312 position:19% line:83% align:start
What the heck are you
talking about?

00:12:16.312 --> 00:12:19.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
@[Sanae]ÚYeah, Tomoya.
Like, @what's the deal, huh?

00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:22.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, now you've got Sanae
drinking, too! Great!

00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:23.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh my, Tomoya,

00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:25.954 position:7% line:83% align:start
could it be that you've taken
an interest in little old me?

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.022 position:7% line:89% align:start
Bored with me already, Tomoya?

00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:29.691 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Here comes the cat fight!

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
One of those cats
is your wife, you know!

00:12:31.526 --> 00:12:33.628 position:30% line:83% align:start
C'mon, Tomoya!
Who do you like better?

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh my! Is he gonna
confess his love to me?

00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:38.132 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you mean? Of course I-

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:40.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
@[Akio]ÚPick Sanae.
Her boobs@are bigger.

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:44.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey buddy! What are you getting
all flustered about... huh?

00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:45.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
That proves he likes
Sanae after all.

00:12:45.672 --> 00:12:46.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:47.974 position:24% line:89% align:start
You don't like me?

00:12:47.974 --> 00:12:49.543 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, it's not that! I mean,

00:12:49.543 --> 00:12:51.578 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, like you as
a person, you know...

00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:52.813 position:30% line:89% align:start
You admit it!

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:55.849 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ahhh! What the hell did I do
to deserve this!?

00:12:55.849 --> 00:12:58.886 position:19% line:77% align:start
@[laughs] All right, I
thinkúwe've teased the boy
enough.

00:12:58.886 --> 00:13:01.320 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Who cares if he likes you
orúnot; You've got me, don't ya?

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.356 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wasn't teasing him,
I was serious.

00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:06.224 position:7% line:89% align:start
I might be interested, myself.

00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:10.061 position:5% line:71% align:start
@What!? Don't leave me Sanae, úl
need your love! Make up your
mind, Tomoya! I'm waiting for an
answer!

00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:12.397 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: Look at that!
Sleeping like a baby.

00:13:12.397 --> 00:13:15.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: Nagisa sure is
happy, isn't she?

00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:17.269 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sure seems that way.

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:19.604 position:27% line:83% align:start
@What about you
TomoyaÚare you happy?

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:22.407 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course I am.

00:13:22.407 --> 00:13:24.776 position:7% line:89% align:start
All I want is to be with her.

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:27.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's funny. I guess that's
all I ever needed.

00:13:33.184 --> 00:13:35.386 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: When her last
semester came around,

00:13:35.386 --> 00:13:39.222 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nagisa's condition
worsened again.

00:13:39.222 --> 00:13:41.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sorry, maybe I dragged
you around too much

00:13:41.024 --> 00:13:42.392 position:24% line:89% align:start
during the break.

00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:44.662 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, no... it's not your fault;

00:13:44.662 --> 00:13:46.931 position:21% line:83% align:start
This always happens
around this time of year.

00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:48.431 position:7% line:89% align:start
Will you be able to graduate?

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:51.568 position:24% line:83% align:start
It should be okay;
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:54.337 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even if I miss the rest of the
year, I attended enough days

00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:55.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
in my last semester to pass.

00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:59.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
I see... That's a
relief, at least.

00:13:59.876 --> 00:14:01.243 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:14:08.584 --> 00:14:10.285 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:12.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: On the day of
the graduation ceremony...

00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:16.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa stared out towards school
from the window in her room.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.195 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Mei]:
Hello, Sunohara residence.

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi, Mei. It's, uh, Okazaki.

00:14:23.498 --> 00:14:28.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mei]: Huh? OH! Okazaki?
Wow, it's been a while!

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:29.871 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, how are you doing?

00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:33.006 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Mei]: Oh, I'm fine. Same old
same old. How are you and
Nagisa?

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:35.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
Y'know, not bad.
Is Sunohara around?

00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:38.078 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Mei]: Actually,
he's not living here right now.

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:39.646 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's staying in a dorm.

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:40.847 position:38% line:89% align:start
A dorm?

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:42.816 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei]: Yeah, his company's dorm.

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:46.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hold on just a sec...
I'll get the number for you.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara]: Yes, can I help you?

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:50.891 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sunohara? It's me.
Your pal Tomoya...

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.058 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Okazaki? Seriously?

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.059 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah. How's it going?

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:57.263 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eh, I'm fine. Work kinda sucks.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:59.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
A lot of stupid stuff
goes on at this company.

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.433 position:10% line:89% align:start
Actually, you got a minute?

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:03.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd like to hear about it,
but some other time.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.838 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have something
important to ask you.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.506 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, so here's the deal...

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:10.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
Whatever time and date works
for you, works for me.

00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:13.076 position:13% line:83% align:start
I still have to coordinate
things with everyone else,

00:15:13.076 --> 00:15:14.879 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I'm sure it'll
work it out somehow.

00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:16.481 position:38% line:89% align:start
You in?

00:15:16.481 --> 00:15:18.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara]: I'm in the
middle of training right now.

00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:19.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I leave the dorm
without permission,

00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:21.653 position:13% line:89% align:start
they'll fire me for sure.

00:15:21.653 --> 00:15:22.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
@Deal with it.

00:15:22.686 --> 00:15:24.521 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara]:
You don't even care?!

00:15:24.521 --> 00:15:25.957 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Ah come on, you can swing
itúfor a day, can't you?

00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:27.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara]: I'm telling
you, it's not that simple.

00:15:27.824 --> 00:15:29.826 position:16% line:83% align:start
This company isn't very
flexible, trust me.

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:31.060 position:19% line:89% align:start
@Please. Do it for me!

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara]: You mean for
Nagisa, right?

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
[sigh] All right,
I'll come up with something.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:37.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
@That's better!

00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:40.603 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara]: [sigh] So much
trouble for someone else's
girlfriend...

00:15:40.603 --> 00:15:43.372 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't believe it. I must
be a really nice guy, huh?

00:15:43.372 --> 00:15:45.207 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course. That's why
I'm asking you.

00:15:45.207 --> 00:15:47.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara]: [chuckle] All right.

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:50.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can always catch me at this
hour, so call me again sometime.

00:15:50.947 --> 00:15:53.114 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah. You bet.

00:15:57.385 --> 00:16:00.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wow! The cherry trees
are so pretty!

00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:02.390 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aren't you glad you came?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
Being together like this really
brings back memories;

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.661 position:21% line:83% align:start
It makes me realize
how nice it was

00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:08.295 position:24% line:83% align:start
to walk to school
with you every morning.

00:16:08.295 --> 00:16:09.831 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, same here.

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you sure we can go
in here without permission?

00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:18.606 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nah, it'll be fine.
I got it all worked out.

00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:20.273 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kyou]: Nagisa!

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:26.847 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:16:26.847 --> 00:16:28.214 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara]: Hey Nagisa!

00:16:28.214 --> 00:16:29.782 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been a while.

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:31.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you?

00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:33.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
Really. We haven't seen
each other in months

00:16:33.453 --> 00:16:35.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
and that's what you say?

00:16:37.657 --> 00:16:40.627 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya laughing] [Kyou]: I
know, pretty funny, huh?

00:16:40.627 --> 00:16:43.930 position:13% line:83% align:start
When I saw him, I was like
who the heck invited this guy?

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.498 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Misae]: Yeah, we were making
fun of Sunohara the whole time

00:16:46.498 --> 00:16:49.401 position:21% line:83% align:start
we were waiting for
you guys to show up.

00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:52.371 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi]: I think it's a
little depressing, in a way.

00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:55.373 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sunohara just isn't Sunohara
without his blond hair.

00:16:55.373 --> 00:16:57.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Ryou]: In that case,
why don't we dye it for him

00:16:57.241 --> 00:16:58.542 position:13% line:89% align:start
before he goes back home?

00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:00.311 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're gonna get me fired!

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.980 position:16% line:83% align:start
It feels like I haven't
seen you in ages.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.314 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you doing all right?

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.483 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Yeah... I'm better now!

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.218 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm just glad this worked out.

00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:10.021 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was afraid we wouldn't get to
see each other like this again.

00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:11.789 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah. We were all disappointed

00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:14.224 position:7% line:83% align:start
when we found out you weren't
coming to graduation,

00:17:14.224 --> 00:17:15.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I imagine it was
even harder on you.

00:17:15.726 --> 00:17:18.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't believe Rie and I
were able to make it today;

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:19.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
Guess it just happened
to work out.

00:17:19.963 --> 00:17:22.198 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm surprised a lot of us
could make it.

00:17:22.198 --> 00:17:24.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
The fact that we're all here
today is practically a miracle.

00:17:24.601 --> 00:17:27.537 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah. If anything, I'd say
this is a miracle of love.

00:17:27.537 --> 00:17:29.639 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh my gosh, Yoshino,
you're SO right!

00:17:29.639 --> 00:17:32.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
W-wait... I don't know
what's going on.

00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:41.249 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a graduation ceremony.

00:17:41.249 --> 00:17:42.316 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:42.316 --> 00:17:43.184 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Ryou]: For you, Nagisa.

00:17:43.184 --> 00:17:45.353 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Huh?!

00:17:49.557 --> 00:17:50.959 position:7% line:89% align:start
We had to pull a few strings,

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:53.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
but luckily, we had
Mr. Koumura on our side.

00:17:53.428 --> 00:17:54.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since he worked here
for so long,

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:57.031 position:27% line:83% align:start
they didn't mind
lending him the school.

00:17:57.031 --> 00:17:58.700 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm happy to help.;

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.002 position:7% line:83% align:start
I couldn't turn down a request
from one of my last students.

00:18:01.002 --> 00:18:03.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: It really means
a lot, sir. Thank you.

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:07.607 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Koumura]:
And now, without further ado...

00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:10.844 position:27% line:83% align:start
let's begin the
graduation ceremony.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.820 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nagisa Furukawa.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Yessir!

00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:31.597 position:10% line:89% align:start
Congratulations, young lady.

00:18:31.597 --> 00:18:34.399 position:16% line:83% align:start
This graduation diploma
certifies that you have

00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:37.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
completed this school's
prescribed curriculum.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.579 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much, sir.

00:19:02.826 --> 00:19:06.496 position:16% line:77% align:start
@In the time I spent at
thisúhigh school... I worked
hard...

00:19:06.496 --> 00:19:09.233 position:10% line:89% align:start
@and faced many challenges.

00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:11.101 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm always shy
around strangers...

00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:13.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I'm not very good
at making friends, either.

00:19:13.803 --> 00:19:16.339 position:13% line:83% align:start
That became a big problem
for me when I got sick

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:19.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
and had to repeat
my senior year.

00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:22.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
In the spring, when I started
my second year as a senior...

00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:25.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
I found myself all alone
in my new class;

00:19:25.347 --> 00:19:27.582 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was really crushing.

00:19:27.582 --> 00:19:29.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was like time
had carried on without me

00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:32.420 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the world had
left me behind.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.256 position:19% line:83% align:start
When I realized that,
suddenly, I couldn't

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
move forward any more.

00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:38.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why I stood there
each morning,

00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:41.263 position:21% line:83% align:start
frozen at the bottom
of this hill.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:45.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
But then... Tomoya showed upúand
gave me the courage I needed

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.102 position:21% line:89% align:start
to climb that hill.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:51.472 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: After that... I met
all sorts of wonderful people.

00:19:51.472 --> 00:19:53.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks to the help
of all my friends here,

00:19:53.007 --> 00:19:55.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was able to form
the drama club...

00:19:55.943 --> 00:19:57.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
and even though
I was being selfish,

00:19:57.745 --> 00:20:00.880 position:10% line:83% align:start
you helped me put on a play
for the school festival.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
But then, in the next semester,
I got sick just like before.

00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:06.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
And even though so many
of my friends graduated,

00:20:06.753 --> 00:20:09.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had to repeat my
senior year again.

00:20:09.088 --> 00:20:12.659 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even still, I was
determined to try my best!

00:20:12.659 --> 00:20:15.727 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wanted to fight... to grow
stronger than I was before!

00:20:15.727 --> 00:20:17.763 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even if my body was weak,

00:20:17.763 --> 00:20:22.034 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wanted to live my life with
all of the strength I could.

00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:24.436 position:10% line:83% align:start
And all the people standing
here today were the ones

00:20:24.436 --> 00:20:27.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
who gave me the
courage to do that.

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:28.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
But it was even harder
than I thought,

00:20:28.841 --> 00:20:31.642 position:16% line:83% align:start
since Tomoya, Miyazawa,
and Nishina all ended up

00:20:31.642 --> 00:20:33.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
in different classes from me.

00:20:33.578 --> 00:20:35.047 position:13% line:89% align:start
Although I had friends...

00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:36.814 position:30% line:83% align:start
I started the
semester alone again,

00:20:36.814 --> 00:20:39.250 position:5% line:89% align:start
just like I did the year before.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:45.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
Despite all that... despite how
tough it was for me...

00:20:45.122 --> 00:20:47.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think the time I spent at
this school was priceless,

00:20:47.657 --> 00:20:50.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I wouldn't trade
it for the world.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, it took me five
years to graduate,

00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:56.867 position:10% line:83% align:start
and it wasn't always fun...
but I still love this school.

00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:00.971 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because it's the place where I
gave it my all every single day.

00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:04.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thank you. I couldn't
have done it without you.

00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:08.711 position:7% line:89% align:start
Congratulations on graduating.

00:21:10.446 --> 00:21:12.882 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
And so... at long last...

00:21:12.882 --> 00:21:17.119 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa's time at this school...
finally came to an end.

00:21:23.758 --> 00:21:26.694 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway... we're going
to get married.

00:21:26.694 --> 00:21:29.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
@I see... úCongratulations.

00:21:29.297 --> 00:21:32.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.336 position:24% line:83% align:start
@[Naoyuki]ÚAh...
I'm sorry, @Nagisa, was it?

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:38.405 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes. That's right, sir.

00:21:38.405 --> 00:21:40.908 position:27% line:83% align:start
@Take good care
of him... Nagisa.

00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:42.709 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes sir, I will.

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:44.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
@[Naoyuki]ÚI wish
you both@the best.

00:21:52.818 --> 00:21:56.489 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: We registered our
marriage without a ceremony.

00:22:00.192 --> 00:22:03.362 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: "Nagisa Okazaki."

00:22:03.362 --> 00:22:04.764 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's funny...

00:22:04.764 --> 00:22:08.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
but somehow, it makesúme
happy just to hear that.

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:58.237 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Calm down!

00:23:58.237 --> 00:24:00.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come on, Tomoya, you've heard
her taking a bath at her house

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:00.705 position:27% line:89% align:start
plenty of times!

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:01.806 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's no big deal!

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:04.043 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: What's wrong?!

00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:06.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: I'm sorry! I didn't
know the water would be so cold!

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:10.615 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: And thus, Nagisa and
I began our new life together.
