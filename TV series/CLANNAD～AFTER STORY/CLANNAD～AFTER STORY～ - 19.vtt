@[in unison] We're home.

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.125 position:19% line:89% align:start
@Welcome back you two.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.063 position:24% line:83% align:start
@Did you have fun
on yourúbig trip?

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:21.804 position:5% line:77% align:start
@Yup.ú[Tomoya] I had a good time
but@I'm still waiting on my
dateúwith you.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:25.546 position:10% line:77% align:start
@Huh?ú[Tomoya] It's not fair
to@promise a guy a date then
notúshow up.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.886 position:10% line:77% align:start
@Such a shame. I wasúreally
looking forward to our@little
vacation together.

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:31.525 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Hey asshole you better
stopúhitting on my wife.

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:33.463 position:41% line:89% align:start
@Akki!

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:37.338 position:10% line:77% align:start
@Of course, you're coming on
ourúdate too, Ushio.
Right?@[Ushio] Yup!

00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:39.175 position:24% line:83% align:start
@Alright, then you
can countúme in too!

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:42.014 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Perfect! The three of us
willúhave a great time.

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:45.388 position:7% line:77% align:start
@Right, Tomoya? Ushio?ú[Akio]
Don't leave me out! I@want to
play too!

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.982 position:35% line:89% align:start
@Nagisa...

00:01:15.654 --> 00:01:17.256 position:19% line:89% align:start
@[Sanae] Hey Tomoya...

00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:21.933 position:5% line:89% align:start
@It hasn't changed at all, huh?

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:26.209 position:5% line:77% align:start
@We've hardly touched thisúroom
since she married you and@moved
out all those years ago.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.181 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Yeah... It's almost
like goingúback in time.

00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:32.422 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Oh would you like to take
thoseúwith you?@[Tomoya] Huh?

00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:37.031 position:10% line:83% align:start
@[Sanae] The stuffed dangos
Iúmean. Ushio loves them.

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:43.846 position:16% line:77% align:start
@I've really imposed on
you.úPlease forgive me.@[Sanae]
Huh?

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:47.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Sorry for forcing Ushio
onúyou all this time.

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:52.898 position:16% line:71% align:start
@But I think this little
vacationúyou sent me on taught
me a lot.@I mean about being a
father.

00:01:52.898 --> 00:01:56.374 position:10% line:77% align:start
There's nothing to be sorry
about. We didn't do anything
special.

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:59.647 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't say that. You raised
Ushio to be a good girl.

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:01.049 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't know how to thank you.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.656 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Okay, next impression
is Egawa! Go!

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.561 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Egawa!

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:10.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hope I can do half as good
as you've done raising her.

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:15.280 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'll try my best to do it on my
own. To teach her to be strong
and kind like her mother.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.688 position:16% line:77% align:start
This really brings back
memories. Akio and I quit our
jobs and

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:22.962 position:7% line:77% align:start
opened this bakery for Nagisa
when she was the same age as
Ushio is now.

00:02:22.962 --> 00:02:25.436 position:30% line:83% align:start
So good luck.
I know you can do it.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:29.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
@I promise I'll repay
yourúkindness anyway I can.

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.915 position:19% line:77% align:start
@It's fine. As long as
you'reúhappy that'll be payment
enough.

00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:37.795 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Thank you. I'll try to
makeúUshio happy too.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.799 position:41% line:89% align:start
@Good.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.470 position:33% line:89% align:start
@Hey Daddy!

00:02:44.576 --> 00:02:46.279 position:19% line:89% align:start
@Hey Ushio. What's up?

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Akki says he wants
toúplay baseball with you.

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:50.522 position:41% line:89% align:start
@Huh?

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.924 position:27% line:89% align:start
@You can do it!

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:54.029 position:24% line:83% align:start
@Give it your best
out thereúyou two!

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:59.207 position:5% line:77% align:start
@Finally decided to wake upúhuh?
Welcome back to the world@of the
living, kid.

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:00.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
@Just shut up and
pitch the ball.

00:03:00.677 --> 00:03:03.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Ushio! I'll show you what
aúloser your daddy is...

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.153 position:10% line:83% align:start
@so you can tease him about
itúfor the rest of your life.

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:06.590 position:13% line:89% align:start
@Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.995 position:7% line:83% align:start
@So who do you think is going
toúwin the match, Ushio?

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:10.030 position:41% line:89% align:start
@Akki!

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
@Give me a break!

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:14.841 position:16% line:77% align:start
@She's been watching my
powerfulúpitches her entire
life.

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:18.682 position:19% line:83% align:start
@Fine! Then I'm going
to showúher a homerun!

00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:20.687 position:33% line:89% align:start
@We'll see.

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.203 position:38% line:89% align:start
@[ping]

00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:29.972 position:19% line:89% align:start
@Huh? I'll be damned!

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:31.008 position:19% line:89% align:start
@You see that, Ushio?

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:33.314 position:19% line:89% align:start
@Yup!ú[glass shatter]

00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:36.688 position:16% line:71% align:start
@That's okay. Nothing a
littleúapology can't fix,
right?@[Ushio] Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!

00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:36.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I couldn't cry, Sanae...
You know that.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.483 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] 'Cause you haven't shed a
tear since that day yourself.

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:45.897 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] You know me pretty
well, don't you?

00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:50.106 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Akio] You bet I do. Who the
Hell do you think you're talking
to?

00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:55.718 position:7% line:71% align:start
I had an important job to do.
Icouldn't cry. I had to raise
Ushio in a way that would make
Nagisa proud.

00:05:57.755 --> 00:05:59.794 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I'm grateful I had that.

00:05:59.794 --> 00:06:02.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because I had her here, I never
lost sight of myself.

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:08.813 position:7% line:71% align:start
Five years, huh? Got to admit
that little girl helped us
through some pretty tough times,
didn't she?

00:06:08.813 --> 00:06:11.652 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] Yeah, she really did.

00:06:11.652 --> 00:06:15.159 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] But that's all over now.
It's okay.

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.629 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] You're right.

00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:20.537 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Akio] You worked hard all
these years.

00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:24.078 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] It was nothing. We're
family, after all.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] It's alright. Let it go.

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:36.305 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] You did a fine job. It's
your turn to cry now. [Sanae]
Akio...

00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:39.345 position:13% line:77% align:start
When it feels like there's
nothing you can do, I'll be
there to help you.

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:42.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll stay by your side until
you don't need to cry anymore.

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:45.557 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akio] So it's okay now.
Let it go.

00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:52.138 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sobbing]

00:07:16.157 --> 00:07:17.392 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right, see you later.

00:07:17.392 --> 00:07:18.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
Away we go!

00:07:18.628 --> 00:07:19.697 position:24% line:89% align:start
Take care you two.

00:07:19.697 --> 00:07:21.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Go get 'em, Ushio!

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:23.071 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:25.276 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Who're you going to
go get?

00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:28.283 position:7% line:83% align:start
Okay Ushio, from now on, it's
just you and your daddy.

00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:31.389 position:13% line:83% align:start
Show him what a good girl
you are. [Ushio] Okay.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:36.632 position:10% line:71% align:start
I forgot to ask, but I hope
youguys can help me pick her up
and drop her off at kindergarten
if I get held up at my job.

00:07:36.632 --> 00:07:38.771 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, just leave it to me!

00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:42.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the other thing...
Have you thought about that?

00:07:44.116 --> 00:07:45.786 position:30% line:89% align:start
It'll be fine.

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:49.127 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Don't worry. I'll pay
him a visit soon.

00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:54.772 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh yes. I heard about your
situation from Mrs Furukawa.

00:07:54.772 --> 00:07:57.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you could finally make
it, Mister Okazaki.

00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:01.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you m'am. I appreciate it.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:04.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
Okay Ushio, Daddy's got to go
to work now.

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:06.864 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay. Have a nice day, Daddy.

00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:09.036 position:19% line:89% align:start
I will. See you later.

00:08:16.018 --> 00:08:20.059 position:10% line:83% align:start
[woman] Look, that guy over
there is Ushio's father...

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:23.300 position:10% line:77% align:start
But if he's here then do you
think something happened with
the Furukawas?

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.635 position:19% line:89% align:start
Like a family dispute?

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:27.542 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>The old me would have</i>
 <i>probably lost it by now.</i>

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:32.252 position:10% line:77% align:start
Excuse me, uh, hi! My name's
Tomoya. I'm Ushio Okazaki's
father.

00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:34.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh... Hello.

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.435 position:33% line:71% align:start
Due to some
extenuatingcircumstances, my
in-laws have been taking care of
my daughter for quite a while.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:42.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
But things worked out and she'll
be living with me from now on.

00:08:42.508 --> 00:08:44.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, nice to meet all of you.

00:08:44.512 --> 00:08:47.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thank you. It's nice to
finally meet you too.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.260 position:16% line:77% align:start
Ushio is friends with my
daughter, so I'm sure we'll see
each other again Mister Okazaki.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course. We'll see you
again soon.

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:57.439 position:16% line:83% align:start
I see. So you decided to
live together, huh?

00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:00.812 position:7% line:77% align:start
Yeah. I'm sorry for making you
guys worry about me all these
years.

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:04.621 position:10% line:77% align:start
But it must be tough right?
Raising a little kid like that
all by yourself.

00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:09.999 position:5% line:71% align:start
Sanae and the Old Man gotthrough
the diapers and the terrible
two's for me, so I should be
fine.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:15.277 position:7% line:77% align:start
Even if things get tough, I'll
hang in there. It can't be as
bad as what they went through.

00:09:15.277 --> 00:09:17.616 position:7% line:83% align:start
Alright well, if you run into
any problems, just let me know.

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:21.525 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure the company, will do
whatever it can to help.

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:24.931 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, in that case... There is
something...

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:28.037 position:41% line:89% align:start
Daddy!

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:32.348 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi Ushio, you ready to go home?
Oh, hello.

00:09:32.348 --> 00:09:37.926 position:5% line:71% align:start
We're in the summer sessionright
now, so Ushio's regular teacher
is taking time off. I'm sorry
you can't meet her.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.898 position:5% line:89% align:start
Taking time off? Oh is she sick?

00:09:40.898 --> 00:09:43.871 position:7% line:77% align:start
[teacher] Oh no, nothing like
that. Actually she's going to a
childcare seminar.

00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:48.683 position:10% line:77% align:start
[teacher] She should be back
next week. I'm sure you'll have
a chance to talk to her then.

00:09:48.683 --> 00:09:50.754 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right. Sounds good.

00:09:50.754 --> 00:09:53.359 position:16% line:83% align:start
So tell me, what's your
teacher like?

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:56.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
She has real long hair. She's
pretty and she's nice.

00:09:56.767 --> 00:09:59.405 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah?

00:09:59.405 --> 00:10:02.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] All right, Daddy needs
to go back to work now.

00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:07.322 position:5% line:77% align:start
If a stranger comes to thedoor,
don't open it no matter what,
okay? [Ushio] Okay.

00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:10.362 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now if anything happens, you
just give Sanae a call.

00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:12.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know the number to the
bakery, don't you?

00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:14.203 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh huh.

00:10:14.203 --> 00:10:17.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry. I'll be back before
it gets dark.

00:10:17.977 --> 00:10:18.979 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll see you later.

00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:21.519 position:24% line:89% align:start
Bye Daddy. See ya.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:51.683 position:7% line:77% align:start
[doorbell][Tomoya] It's Daddy.
My hands are full. Can you open
the door for me?

00:10:55.859 --> 00:10:57.596 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:10:57.596 --> 00:10:59.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I brought a bunch of stuff from
the Furukawas.

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:03.408 position:5% line:77% align:start
I got the Big Dango Family, and
all of your clothes and your
toys too...

00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:07.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
First, let's find a place
to put this.

00:11:07.082 --> 00:11:09.188 position:10% line:83% align:start
What do you think? Where's a
good spot?

00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:14.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right here.

00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:17.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
Alright then, that works for me.

00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:27.125 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Daddy, can you cook?

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:31.502 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm going to learn to
cook starting today. Let's work
on it together, okay?

00:11:31.502 --> 00:11:33.205 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Okay.

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:35.577 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Okazaki!

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:40.755 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Hi Kouko, long
time no see.

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:44.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know, it's been years
hasn't it? And who is this?

00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:48.839 position:7% line:83% align:start
She's my daughter, Ushio. It's
okay, say hello Ushio.

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:50.376 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello, lady.

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:55.988 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hi there. Nice to meet you.
I'm Kouko Yoshino.

00:11:55.988 --> 00:12:01.934 position:5% line:77% align:start
She looks just like her mother,
doesn't she? It really brings
back memories for me.

00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:05.741 position:7% line:77% align:start
I bet she'll grow up to be as
cute and as brave as her mother
too.

00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:07.746 position:7% line:83% align:start
And hopefully she'll have just
as many wonderful friends.

00:12:07.746 --> 00:12:10.686 position:7% line:83% align:start
I sure hope so. I want to give
her the best I can.

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:14.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
She used to be Mommy's
teacher, Ushio.

00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:17.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, Yoshino told me the
news about your little sister.

00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:19.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] She's finally out of
the hospital, huh?

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] That must be a
big relief.

00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:25.450 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes, the doctor said it was a
miracle. But we always had faith

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
that she would wake up some day.
We never gave up hope.

00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:31.697 position:7% line:77% align:start
Actually, my sister's with me
right now if you want to meet
her.

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:35.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan!

00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:46.328 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Kouko] You don't have to be
shy. Go ahead and introduce
yourself.

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:50.805 position:10% line:89% align:start
So this is your sister, huh?

00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:58.789 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:03.098 position:7% line:83% align:start
She's got some sense of humor,
doesn't she?

00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:08.308 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's okay. Come back. These two
are my friends. There's no
reason for you to be afraid.

00:13:08.308 --> 00:13:13.419 position:16% line:77% align:start
This is my sister, Fuko.
Fu-chan, this is Okazaki and
Ushio.

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:14.689 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's nice to meet you.

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:25.913 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] What now? [Fuko] She's
so cute! Can Fuko hug her
please, right now?

00:13:25.913 --> 00:13:28.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why bother asking if you're
going to do it anyway?!

00:13:28.819 --> 00:13:31.592 position:10% line:83% align:start
Fu-chan, you can't do that.
It's rude.

00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:35.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't be hard on her. She can't
help the way she is.

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.504 position:13% line:89% align:start
How old is she by the way?

00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:39.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
Believe it or not, she's the
same age as you.

00:13:39.842 --> 00:13:43.885 position:10% line:77% align:start
I know she may seem a little
immature but she was asleep for
an awfully long time,

00:13:43.885 --> 00:13:46.958 position:7% line:83% align:start
so she still has the mentality
of a high school freshman.

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.565 position:13% line:83% align:start
High school? Are you sure
you don't mean kindergarten?

00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:54.274 position:10% line:77% align:start
My goodness, you and Okazaki
sure do like to pick on poor
little Fuko!

00:13:54.274 --> 00:13:58.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'll show you! I'm going to
make Ushio my little sister!

00:13:58.183 --> 00:14:00.754 position:7% line:83% align:start
Fu-chan, stop it. That doesn't
even make any sense.

00:14:00.754 --> 00:14:03.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I can sneak her away while
you're both confused?

00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.128 position:21% line:89% align:start
[in unison] No way.

00:14:04.128 --> 00:14:07.936 position:19% line:89% align:start
Alas the day is lost!

00:14:11.577 --> 00:14:13.514 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know she may be a little
on the weird side,

00:14:13.514 --> 00:14:16.154 position:7% line:77% align:start
but aren't you glad you made a
new friend today? [Ushio]
Uh-huh!

00:14:16.154 --> 00:14:19.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, Daddy's taking a day
off from work tomorrow.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.632 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want to go somewhere
together, okay?

00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:23.803 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are we going on a trip?

00:14:23.803 --> 00:14:25.841 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No, not exactly.

00:14:31.052 --> 00:14:33.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you love the Big Dango
Family too, huh?

00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:38.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh. Sanae told me that it
smells like Mommy.

00:14:38.234 --> 00:14:39.637 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:41.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
It smells good.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.755 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm home. [Radio]

00:15:03.755 --> 00:15:05.192 position:19% line:89% align:start

seven, eight...

00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:22.261 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's you. Oh Tomoya.

00:15:32.817 --> 00:15:34.121 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm finally home.

00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:36.225 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:15:36.225 --> 00:15:38.529 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're looking old, Dad.

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:40.667 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:15:42.872 --> 00:15:45.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] This is your
granddaughter, Ushio.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.347 position:30% line:89% align:start
[father] Oh...

00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:48.484 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you, grandpa.

00:15:48.484 --> 00:15:50.088 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:56.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
Have you been at home all
this time?

00:15:56.268 --> 00:15:58.940 position:27% line:89% align:start
[father] Uh-huh.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
I went and saw grandma just the
other day.

00:16:01.645 --> 00:16:03.450 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ushio and I took a trip up
north and I spoke to her then.

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:11.032 position:7% line:77% align:start
Do you remember the place? You
took me there once when I was
little.

00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:12.869 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:16:12.869 --> 00:16:15.809 position:13% line:83% align:start
Grandma told me all sorts
of things.

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
About me and you when I
was growing up.

00:16:18.315 --> 00:16:24.394 position:5% line:77% align:start
It made me realize how difficult
it must've been for you. It also
brought back a lot of memories.

00:16:26.332 --> 00:16:30.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
Listen Dad... You must be
tired, right?

00:16:30.341 --> 00:16:32.043 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:32.043 --> 00:16:36.052 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't you think it's finally
time you took a vacation?

00:16:36.052 --> 00:16:38.358 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you go back to
your hometown?

00:16:38.358 --> 00:16:40.428 position:13% line:89% align:start
Grandma's waiting for you.

00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:45.740 position:7% line:77% align:start
At the place where you took my
hand and decided to raise me on
your own. All those years ago.

00:16:48.078 --> 00:16:49.714 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:16:49.714 --> 00:16:53.356 position:5% line:77% align:start
You've worked hard enough, Dad.
You've done more than enough for
me.

00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:55.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can rest now.

00:16:55.894 --> 00:17:01.173 position:5% line:77% align:start
You can finally go back home. Go
and spend some time with your
mother, okay?

00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:21.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are... are you sure? It's
alright now?

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:23.587 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is what alright?

00:17:23.587 --> 00:17:27.863 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have I... have I done
everything I need to do, yet?

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:44.799 position:5% line:71% align:start
Listen, you sacrificedeverything
you had to raise me. How can you
even ask me a question like
that?

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:50.244 position:13% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] You gave up your
wholelife for a worthless son
like me... And in all that time
I never even thought to thank

00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:55.088 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've done enough, okay?!

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.829 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see...

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:04.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
My work was already done. And
I never even realized it.

00:18:06.078 --> 00:18:10.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's wonderful. What a relief.
It's over.

00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:41.253 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're all packed. You've got a
change of clothes and I gave you
a little money, just in case.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.291 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you. It means a lot.

00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:46.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll give Grandma a call soon to
let her know that you're coming.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.969 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just be careful not to lose
your bag along the way.

00:18:48.969 --> 00:18:51.843 position:19% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'll be careful.

00:18:51.843 --> 00:18:54.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Don't worry. I'll take
care of the house.

00:18:54.882 --> 00:18:56.887 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll clear up your debt, too.

00:18:56.887 --> 00:18:59.660 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh. Alright. Thank you.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.900 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ushio, hey. Say goodbye to
Grandpa, okay?

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.070 position:13% line:89% align:start
Bye-bye. See you Grandpa.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bye-bye.

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:15.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, this is it. Thanks again.

00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:17.431 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've got to take good care of
yourself, okay?

00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.733 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:19:20.102 --> 00:19:22.642 position:13% line:89% align:start
And don't drink too much.

00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:25.414 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:28.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
[father] Tomoya...
Look, I brought some candy.

00:19:28.587 --> 00:19:32.061 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't smoke too much either,
okay? [father] Yeah.

00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:36.772 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sorry but Dad has to go back to
work now. Try not to spoil your
dinner.

Live a long life and
healthy life.

00:19:38.809 --> 00:19:41.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry I have to leave
you alone so much.

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:43.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
Some day, I'll repay all the
kindness you've shown me.

00:19:43.654 --> 00:19:47.461 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now be a good boy. I'll make you
dinner when I come home,
alright?

00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:49.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll do whatever it takes, okay?

00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:51.771 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then we can eat together.

00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:58.786 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right, Tomoya?

00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:08.573 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tomoya? What's wrong?

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:14.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on now. Why are you crying?

00:20:22.003 --> 00:20:28.215 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, Ushio. Don't worry
about me, I'm fine.

00:20:31.221 --> 00:20:33.459 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Dad...

00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:36.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thank you. For everything.
[father] Sure.

00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:44.382 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, goodbye.

00:20:44.382 --> 00:20:46.054 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, take care Dad.

00:20:46.054 --> 00:20:48.558 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure, I will. You take care too.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Tomoya] In all those years,</i>
 <i>I wonder if he was happy.</i>

00:21:02.555 --> 00:21:07.199 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>He lost the only woman he</i>
 <i>ever loved when his life</i>
 <i>should've been perfect...</i>

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:10.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>And then, all</i>
 <i>he had was me.</i>

00:21:10.806 --> 00:21:15.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>He worked and worked for such</i>
 <i>an ungrateful son...</i>

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:18.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>I wonder... I wonder if he</i>
 <i>ever found any joy in that.</i>

00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:25.905 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry Dad...

00:21:51.793 --> 00:21:53.597 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong, Ushio?

00:21:53.597 --> 00:21:55.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
There's a light...

00:21:55.334 --> 00:21:59.710 position:13% line:83% align:start
A light? Is it too bright?
Come here.

00:23:44.133 --> 00:23:48.376 position:16% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Oh yeah, Ushio,
someone's coming to see you
tomorrow.

00:23:48.376 --> 00:23:50.314 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ushio, do you know any games?

00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.720 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ushio, say goodbye to Mommy.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.391 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Ushio.

00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:57.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's dangerous. Wait for me!

00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:04.878 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Daddy. Good luck.
