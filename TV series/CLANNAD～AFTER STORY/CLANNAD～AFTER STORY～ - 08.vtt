00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:09.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [yawn]

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:12.310 position:27% line:89% align:start
Didn't get enough sleep?

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess it's pretty obvious.

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:18.248 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I couldn't sleep
at all last night.

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:20.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought for sure you'd
have some kind of charm

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.451 position:38% line:89% align:start
to help you sleep.

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:24.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not that I don't
have one, it's just...

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.956 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] "A charm to
help you sleep well...

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:28.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sleep on someone's lap.

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:31.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you do this, you'll be able
to have a peaceful nap."

00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:33.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:36.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
That isn't much
of a charm, is it?

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:39.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
Either way, I bet it would
solve your sleeping problems.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:41.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
When I couldn't sleep before,

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:44.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
I used to have my brother help
me out with the charm.

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
But now that I'm older,
it's a bit awkward.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:47.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, wait!

00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just thought of something!

00:00:49.142 --> 00:00:50.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since your brother
isn't around,

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:52.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
why don't you sleep on
Tomoya's lap, instead?

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:53.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
Perfect, right?

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:55.279 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What?!

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
Um... it's probably
better if I don't.

00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:00.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd feel like I was
imposing too much.

00:01:00.752 --> 00:01:02.352 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:04.956 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, don't worry about it.
Come on.

00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:16.264 position:27% line:83% align:start
Since you were
kind enough to offer,

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:18.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
it wouldn't hurt to
borrow him for a bit.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.369 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [awkward sigh]

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.037 position:50% line:89% align:start
Okay, here I go.

00:01:23.138 --> 00:01:24.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh... sure.

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:32.012 position:50% line:83% align:start
Ah... That feels
so nice...

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:33.379 position:50% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:37.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess the charm worked.
She fell right asleep.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.787 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know this was your idea and
all, but doesn't it bother you?

00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:44.288 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you want me to be honest,

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.357 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I'm a little jealous, sure.

00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:49.493 position:38% line:83% align:start
But really, I'm just
glad she's resting.

00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:52.830 position:50% line:83% align:start
 I bet yesterday
 wore her out.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.832 position:16% line:83% align:start
On top of that,
she's probably stressed out

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:58.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
from all the fighting her
friends have been doing lately.

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.137 position:27% line:89% align:start
Woohoo! Is Yukine here?

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:03.239 position:38% line:83% align:start
I hope she's making
more pilaf today!

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:04.373 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [cheering]

00:02:04.473 --> 00:02:06.542 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [screaming]

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.778 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [groaning]

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.648 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shh! Quiet!

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:15.649 position:72% line:89% align:start
Huh? Ah!

00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:20.620 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kazuto... Kazuto...

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:55.835 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.938 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I was completely passed
out before I even realized it!

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.473 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah, don't worry about it.
I don't mind.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:03.942 position:27% line:83% align:start
Next time, why don't you
sleep on my lap instead?

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:06.077 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now remind me,
why are you here, again?

00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:09.413 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to see Yukine again,
you got a problem with that?

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:12.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[both growling]
-[window opens]

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.384 position:38% line:89% align:start
Big Sis!

00:04:13.484 --> 00:04:14.852 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sudou, what's wrong?!

00:04:14.952 --> 00:04:16.452 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [pained grunt]

00:04:18.688 --> 00:04:22.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] Oh no... they still
think Sunohara is my brother?

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:23.326 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sudou] Afraid so.

00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:24.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
And since they saw him
running around,

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:27.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
that means they think
Kazuto's out of the hospital.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
In other words, they're scared
outta their minds.

00:04:34.902 --> 00:04:36.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've been fighting back and
forth for a while,

00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:39.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
but they probably think Kazuto's
gonna finish 'em off.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:42.008 position:5% line:83% align:start
They've been trying to bring as
much pain as they can

00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:43.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
before that happens.

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:45.945 position:5% line:83% align:start
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this!

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:48.247 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] But this is just
a misunderstanding!

00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:50.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, it wasn't even
Sunohara who beat them up...

00:04:50.783 --> 00:04:52.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -...it was Tomoyo.
 -[Tomoyo] Miyazawa.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:53.885 position:50% line:83% align:start
We need to talk
about yesterday.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:56.486 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh crap!
See you later, Big Sis!

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.023 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ah! Sudou, wait!

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:03.961 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like I came at the
right time. How convenient.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [worried sigh]

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:12.301 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] You just can't seem

00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:13.969 position:16% line:83% align:start
to keep yourself out
of trouble, can you?

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not like we wanted to get
wrapped up in this mess...

00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:18.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're one to talk.

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:20.175 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you hadn't pretended
to be Kazuto Miyazawa,

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:22.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
none of this would've
happened in the first place.

00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.813 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kazuto Miyazawa?
Is that what this is about?

00:05:26.914 --> 00:05:29.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
I used to hear rumors about
him all the time

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
back in my street fighting days.

00:05:31.317 --> 00:05:32.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
I never actually met him,

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
but people said he
was the only person

00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:37.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
who could take me
in a one-on-one fight.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.691 position:16% line:89% align:start
Better not to test that one.

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's funny, people used to
tell my brother

00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:45.396 position:5% line:83% align:start
that you were the only person
who could beat him.

00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:46.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen, I know you mean well,

00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:50.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I won't mention any of
this to the school board.

00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:51.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
However...

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:53.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
However?

00:05:53.203 --> 00:05:55.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had the opportunity to speak
with the student council

00:05:55.604 --> 00:05:58.140 position:16% line:83% align:start
from a school on the
other side of town.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
They said they've been dealing

00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
with a lot of
gang violence lately.

00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:03.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
Frankly, if the situation
has gotten this bad,

00:06:03.978 --> 00:06:07.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's only a matter of time
before the police get involved.

00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:09.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I were you, I would stop all
this silly fighting

00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:12.119 position:5% line:83% align:start
and resolve your differences
while you still can.

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.288 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't, then both sides
are going to suffer.

00:06:21.093 --> 00:06:22.727 position:27% line:89% align:start
[pained groans]

00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:25.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
Damn it! I'm gonna make those
punks pay for what they did!

00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:28.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
 We gotta fight like
 a team this time!

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right! Let's murder 'em!

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:32.270 position:16% line:83% align:start
  -[cheers]
  -Yeah! All right!

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miyazawa, I hate to ask this,

00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:36.639 position:5% line:83% align:start
but when is your brother gonna
be released from the hospital?

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:38.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] If Kazuto told
them to stop fighting,

00:06:38.674 --> 00:06:40.643 position:16% line:89% align:start
they'd listen, right?

00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:44.913 position:27% line:89% align:start
[troubled sigh]

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Hold on, where are you going?!

00:06:47.082 --> 00:06:50.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to talk to the other
gang! It's our only choice!

00:06:50.152 --> 00:06:51.552 position:50% line:89% align:start
  Miyazawa, no!

00:06:51.652 --> 00:06:53.621 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stay here, I'll be right back.

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:58.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come back! Miyazawa!

00:07:02.295 --> 00:07:03.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please think this over.

00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:06.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't accomplish anything
by talking to those guys!

00:07:06.598 --> 00:07:07.900 position:27% line:89% align:start
If I talk to them,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
we might be able to reach
some sort of agreement.

00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:12.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
 They know me well enough.
 It's not like I'm their enemy.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.206 position:5% line:89% align:start
What about your brother?

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:16.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
Does he even know what's
going on right now?

00:07:16.607 --> 00:07:17.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure he's in the hospital,

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.310 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he can still reason
with his gang

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
over the phone, can't he?

00:07:30.052 --> 00:07:31.821 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:33.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
If we all end up in the slammer,

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:35.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
our turf ain't gonna
mean a damned thing.

00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:36.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's only a matter of time.

00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
People are starting to take
notice of the fighting

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.395 position:16% line:89% align:start
 on both sides of the river.

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:42.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ain't no way we're
gonna pull back now!

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now that Kazuto Miyazawa's
back on the scene,

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
we gotta finish them
before they finish us!

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this is all a
misunderstanding...

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.902 position:38% line:89% align:start
A misunderstanding?

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.405 position:38% line:83% align:start
Shoulda told that
to your brother

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
before he cleaned the frikkin'
pavement with our faces!

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:56.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
We told you
that was Tomoyo Sa-

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:01.645 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Yukine. We ain't
got nothing against you,

00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:03.681 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you can't tell us
not to fight those guys!

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:05.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
We got our asses handed
to us out there!

00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:08.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now you just expect us to roll
over and put up with it?!

00:08:08.452 --> 00:08:10.187 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Cool it, guys,
 that's enough.

00:08:10.287 --> 00:08:11.555 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is war!

00:08:11.654 --> 00:08:13.456 position:16% line:83% align:start
This ain't gonna stop 'til
one of us is finished!

00:08:13.557 --> 00:08:14.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a fight to the death!

00:08:14.724 --> 00:08:17.260 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [cheers in agreement]

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.429 position:16% line:83% align:start
When I tell you to cool it,
you shut your mouth!

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [mumbling]

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.333 position:27% line:83% align:start
You guys are being rude
to our guests.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.267 position:50% line:89% align:start
Yukine...

00:08:26.368 --> 00:08:28.803 position:16% line:83% align:start
even after I got in a fight
with your friends...

00:08:28.903 --> 00:08:31.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
 you still took care of me.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.674 position:27% line:89% align:start
I won't forget that.

00:08:34.774 --> 00:08:36.709 position:27% line:83% align:start
I won't forget the
kindness you showed...

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.877 position:50% line:83% align:start
or the taste
of your pilaf.

00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:39.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dude, you kidding me?

00:08:39.312 --> 00:08:41.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's had those bandages
on for a month now...

00:08:41.448 --> 00:08:42.715 position:38% line:89% align:start
What can I say?

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:45.251 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sasaki's a real sucker
for girls who can cook...

00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:46.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
You say something?

00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:48.186 position:5% line:89% align:start
No! Nothing at all!

00:08:49.854 --> 00:08:51.889 position:27% line:83% align:start
But look, I know
how these guys feel

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.459 position:5% line:83% align:start
and there's no way we can
let this end without a fight.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.126 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, I got an idea.

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:59.463 position:16% line:83% align:start
How bout we have our leaders
fight in a duel, one-on-one?

00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:01.063 position:5% line:89% align:start
One-on-one?

00:09:01.164 --> 00:09:02.932 position:38% line:83% align:start
A duel between me
and your brother.

00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:05.034 position:38% line:83% align:start
Last man standing
is the winner.

00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:07.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
The loser gives in,
and the gang war stops.

00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:10.472 position:16% line:83% align:start
 That's as far as
 I'm willing to compromise.

00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:12.773 position:27% line:89% align:start
[troubled sigh]

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:16.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
What?! You mean you
actually agreed to that?!

00:09:16.611 --> 00:09:19.679 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's no good, Sis! You can't
make these kind of decisions

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:21.115 position:5% line:89% align:start
without letting us know!

00:09:21.215 --> 00:09:25.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry... but it was
the only I thing I could do.

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:27.353 position:38% line:83% align:start
It'll happen
tomorrow at sunset.

00:09:27.453 --> 00:09:29.021 position:38% line:89% align:start
By the river.

00:09:29.121 --> 00:09:32.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it ain't like Kazuto
can fight for us.

00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:34.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
Somebody else is gonna have
to take his place.

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:38.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess you're right, but are
they gonna be happy with that?

00:09:38.229 --> 00:09:41.265 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, guys, They still think
Sunohara is Kazuto, right?

00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:43.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you have him
go fight for you instead?

00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:44.435 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hm?

00:09:44.535 --> 00:09:45.468 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Huh?!

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why didn't I think of that?!

00:09:46.937 --> 00:09:47.836 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Are you kidding?!

00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:48.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tajima, hold on!

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:49.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
That was all a mistake!

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara has nothing
to do with this!

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:53.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
This would be a piece of cake
for you, right?

00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:55.344 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just earlier you were
bragging about how you beat up

00:09:55.444 --> 00:09:58.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
four guys from that rival
gang all by yourself!

00:09:58.447 --> 00:09:59.847 position:27% line:89% align:start
All four by himself?!

00:09:59.948 --> 00:10:01.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
And here I thought you were
just some little twerp.

00:10:01.782 --> 00:10:03.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry for choking you
so much, pal!

00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:05.152 position:16% line:89% align:start
I guess that goes to show,

00:10:05.252 --> 00:10:07.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
you shouldn't judge a book
by its cover.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's really something else,
isn't he?

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:11.123 position:38% line:83% align:start
W-wow, thanks,
you guys, but...

00:10:11.225 --> 00:10:13.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're counting on you, Big Bro!

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:15.861 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, you gotta lend
us your strength!

00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:24.169 position:16% line:83% align:start
First things first,
could you get me a refill?

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:26.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Sunohara,
are you sure

00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:28.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
you want to go through
with this?

00:10:28.172 --> 00:10:30.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
There has to be another way!

00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:32.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
Having a fight
to stop people from fighting

00:10:32.643 --> 00:10:34.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
just doesn't make any sense!

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:38.780 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [Yukine] I'm sorry...

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even though
we're fighting them,

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sasaki and his gang
aren't bad people.

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:46.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
But when there are two different
gangs in a small town like this,

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:49.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's inevitable that they're
going to fight.

00:10:50.992 --> 00:10:52.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
Neither side will be happy

00:10:52.326 --> 00:10:54.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
until this grudge
is finally settled...

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.529 position:5% line:89% align:start
And until that day comes,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't believe this town
can truly be happy, either.

00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:03.269 position:5% line:89% align:start
It just doesn't seem fair.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
They aren't bad people.
How did it come to this?

00:11:18.582 --> 00:11:20.916 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckling] Guess this stuff
is pretty hardcore, huh?

00:11:21.017 --> 00:11:23.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! We gonna do this or what?

00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:25.888 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Wait 'til Sasaki gets here!

00:11:25.988 --> 00:11:28.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think my heart's
about to explode.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, why don't you eat
something while you're waiting?

00:11:31.793 --> 00:11:33.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
A little snack might
help calm your nerves.

00:11:33.695 --> 00:11:36.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here, this is a little something
my mom made just for you.

00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:38.499 position:16% line:89% align:start
From Sanae, you say?!

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told her you had a an
important battle to fight today,

00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:43.671 position:27% line:83% align:start
so she made a special
recipe just for you.

00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:45.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
Her newest creation...

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:47.340 position:16% line:89% align:start
The "Hyper Rainbow Bread!

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.143 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, and my dad had
a message for you.

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:54.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
He said, "You gotta feel the
rainbow deep in your heart."

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:57.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not only that, a friend of mine
made some of her "ultimate jam"

00:11:57.516 --> 00:11:58.717 position:16% line:89% align:start
to share with you, too.

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:00.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you spread some of this
ultimate jam

00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:02.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
on the hyper rainbow bread,
you'll be invincible!

00:12:03.054 --> 00:12:04.355 position:27% line:89% align:start
Satisfaction guaranteed!

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:07.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now don't be shy, there's
plenty to go around!

00:12:07.624 --> 00:12:08.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, really?
You don't mind?

00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:10.993 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Great! I'd love to try it!

00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:13.763 position:27% line:89% align:start
 To victory!

00:12:13.862 --> 00:12:16.864 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [groaning]

00:12:18.066 --> 00:12:19.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
You don't like the bread?!

00:12:19.967 --> 00:12:21.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't give up on us now!

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:24.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
 [Sasaki]
 Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:12:24.838 --> 00:12:25.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, damn!

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:27.074 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are we going to do now?

00:12:27.174 --> 00:12:28.942 position:16% line:89% align:start
 The whole gang's out cold!

00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:33.879 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll do it.

00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:36.349 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -Tomoya, no!
 -You sure about this?

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:38.050 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No time
for second thoughts!

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Take care of Sunohara for me!

00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:41.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, wait!

00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:47.224 position:16% line:89% align:start
  And who the hell are you?

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:49.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's been a little
misunderstanding.

00:12:49.326 --> 00:12:52.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
That blonde guy over there
isn't really Kazuto Miyazawa.

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:55.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but it looks like
I'm the best they could get.

00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:57.100 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's no good. If we don't
have the real Kazuto,

00:12:59.235 --> 00:13:00.603 position:5% line:89% align:start
 there's no way we can win this!

00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:03.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Yuu's sister] You have to
call your brother, Yukine!

00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:05.507 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] She's right!
Even with Tomoya's help,

00:13:05.607 --> 00:13:07.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
if Kazuto doesn't show up
and win the duel,

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:10.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
then everyone'll
just keep fighting forever!

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:13.147 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [pained grunt]

00:13:15.282 --> 00:13:18.084 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right, fine. Just don't
cry when I break your face.

00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:19.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
Heh.

00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:21.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll give it my best!

00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:23.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [grunting]

00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:24.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, Bro!

00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:26.225 position:61% line:89% align:start
Tear him up!

00:13:28.293 --> 00:13:31.362 position:5% line:83% align:start

There something wrong
with your right shoulder?

A little, yeah. Why don't you
worry about yourself, first?!

 Hey, wait a minute!

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:43.443 position:5% line:83% align:start

you mess with us!

They're after Sasaki!

Hold up, Bro!

00:15:52.283 --> 00:15:53.919 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it! Stay back!

That's him!
That's the real Kazuto Miyazawa!

00:16:15.004 --> 00:16:17.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you snuck out of
the hospital, huh?

00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:19.607 position:16% line:83% align:start
You got guts,
just like the rumors say.

00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:21.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've been waiting for this!

00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:23.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry it's gotta
be this way,

00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:25.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'm putting an end
to it for good!

[pained grunts]

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:42.827 position:50% line:89% align:start
 It's not over!

00:16:42.928 --> 00:16:46.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stop it! What the hell
are you doing?!

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.633 position:38% line:83% align:start
I won't lose!
I'm Kazuto Miyazawa!

00:16:49.733 --> 00:16:51.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
Miyazawa, no!

00:16:51.134 --> 00:16:53.636 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Let me go! Let me go!

00:16:53.736 --> 00:16:55.705 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought she was up
on the hill with us...

00:16:55.805 --> 00:16:57.639 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, she said she was going
to talk to her brother

00:16:57.739 --> 00:16:59.441 position:5% line:83% align:start
and took off running
a little while back.

00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:00.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Sudou crying]

00:17:00.842 --> 00:17:02.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought she was just
going to the hospital, but...

00:17:02.744 --> 00:17:06.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
Big Sis can't go talk
to her brother...

00:17:06.314 --> 00:17:09.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter how bad it gets,
Kazuto can't come save us!

00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:11.384 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Let me go!

00:17:12.954 --> 00:17:15.322 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Stop it! Stay out of this!

00:17:15.422 --> 00:17:16.890 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Come on, that's enough!

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.424 position:72% line:89% align:start
Big Sis!

00:17:18.524 --> 00:17:20.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it;
why's she doing this?

00:17:21.627 --> 00:17:23.529 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [growling]

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.564 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you?!

00:17:27.432 --> 00:17:29.166 position:16% line:89% align:start
What, are you stupid?!

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:30.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
She wanted to stop you
from fighting!

00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:33.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
The only way to stop you
idiots from killing each other

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.738 position:16% line:89% align:start
is for Kazuto to show up!

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:37.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why she pretended
to be her brother!

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:39.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now do you finally get it?!

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.044 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Why? Why do you have to fight?

00:17:45.246 --> 00:17:47.083 position:16% line:89% align:start
 What can I do to stop this?

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:49.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll do anything! Anything!

00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:54.121 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't care, just please stop!

00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:59.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, I'm begging you.

00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:02.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can't we finally put
an end to all this?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's... that's what my
brother would've wanted.

00:18:19.777 --> 00:18:22.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see, so that's what
this was about.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] For the longest time
I was afraid of my brother.

00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:32.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't understand why
he did the things he did.

00:18:32.187 --> 00:18:34.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of his friends seemed scary
to me as well...

00:18:34.523 --> 00:18:36.391 position:5% line:89% align:start
But when I saw Sudou and Tajima

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
and everyone else
crying at his funeral,

00:18:38.626 --> 00:18:41.596 position:5% line:83% align:start
I started to feel
a bit differently.

00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:43.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why did I shy away
from my brother

00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:47.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
instead of trying to understand
the choices he made in life?

00:18:48.101 --> 00:18:49.502 position:5% line:89% align:start
To make amends for that,

00:18:49.602 --> 00:18:52.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
I gathered my courage and tried
to talk to his friends.

00:18:52.605 --> 00:18:56.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, they all seemed
pretty scary when we first met.

00:18:56.374 --> 00:18:59.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
But bit by bit, they let me
into their group and I finally

00:18:59.145 --> 00:19:01.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
began to understand
my brother's feelings.

00:19:01.646 --> 00:19:05.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, whenever we're together,
I feel like Kazuto is there too.

00:19:05.816 --> 00:19:09.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can almost see him smiling
alongside all his friends.

00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:12.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kazuto wanted
the fighting to stop...

00:19:12.588 --> 00:19:14.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
until his dying breath
he was opposed to it.

00:19:15.058 --> 00:19:17.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
Still, if word got out that
he was dead, Sasaki's gang

00:19:17.894 --> 00:19:20.662 position:5% line:83% align:start
might try to take advantage
of that and try to attack us.

00:19:20.762 --> 00:19:24.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
We had a long talk and came
to a difficult decision.

00:19:24.465 --> 00:19:27.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
We would keep my brother's
death a secret.

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:33.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
My brother's wish was to rid
this town of all the fighting...

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if I'm not
as strong as him,

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:37.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanted to make that happen.

00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:40.813 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not fair...

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:43.482 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [sobbing]

00:20:02.398 --> 00:20:06.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think... No, I'm sure
Kazuto is happy right now.

00:20:07.837 --> 00:20:08.971 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:16.944 --> 00:20:19.880 position:27% line:83% align:start
  What's wrong, Tomoya?
  You see something?

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like I huge weight's
been lifted off my shoulders.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I can finally
put my brother to rest

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:40.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
now that I've seen
his final wish come true.

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:43.433 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's all thanks to your help.

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.535 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you all so much.

00:20:47.971 --> 00:20:50.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's a famous folklore
story in this town;

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:51.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
perhaps you've heard it?

00:20:51.974 --> 00:20:53.008 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Folklore, what?

00:20:53.108 --> 00:20:55.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whenever something
good happens,

00:20:55.443 --> 00:20:57.378 position:5% line:83% align:start
or someone achieves
true happiness,

00:20:57.478 --> 00:21:00.081 position:5% line:83% align:start
an orb of light appears
in the sky.

00:21:00.182 --> 00:21:02.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
No one knows where
the orbs come from...

00:21:02.183 --> 00:21:04.886 position:5% line:83% align:start
but what we do know is that
they're a symbol of happiness

00:21:04.986 --> 00:21:07.687 position:5% line:83% align:start
born from the kindness
in people's hearts.

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:10.824 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whatever they may be, the legend
says that if you find one,

00:21:10.924 --> 00:21:12.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
it'll grant you a wish.

00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:16.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tomoya, that's like
what happened with Misae.

00:21:16.162 --> 00:21:17.428 position:61% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:19.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Supposedly, they used
to be quite common,

00:21:19.564 --> 00:21:21.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
but now people
hardly ever see them.

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:24.969 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but Okazaki saw
one just the other day.

00:21:26.004 --> 00:21:27.238 position:5% line:89% align:start
Perhaps it was a coincidence,

00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:29.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
or perhaps there's something
special about him

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:30.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
that we don't know yet.

00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:32.708 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What do you mean?
-Like, special in what way?

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't tell you.
Or rather, I don't know, myself.

00:21:36.145 --> 00:21:37.814 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [sighing]

00:21:37.914 --> 00:21:41.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Okazaki is Okazaki...
that's all that matters.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.585 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's a precious friend
I cherish very much.

00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:47.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you too; I cherish all of
your friendships very dearly.

00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:53.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so grateful to have
this happiness at long last.

00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:57.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so grateful to have these
friends to support me.

00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:05.938 position:16% line:89% align:start
 So, thank you, Kazuto.

00:22:06.038 --> 00:22:07.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
I hope you're watching.

00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:43.322 position:38% line:83% align:start
By the way, what are
you planning to do

00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:45.056 position:16% line:89% align:start
 after you graduate, Tomoya?

You're looking awfully glum
this morning, amigo.

Is your honeymoon period
with Nagisa over already?

The last time Nagisa
ended up missing class,

00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:57.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
you were spaced out for weeks.

00:23:57.466 --> 00:23:59.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I'm just saying you shouldn't
get stressed out over nothing.

 Poor guy. I wonder if that took
 his mind off of things a bit.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.674 position:5% line:89% align:start
I feel so bad.

00:24:05.774 --> 00:24:08.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya looked really
depressed, didn't he?
