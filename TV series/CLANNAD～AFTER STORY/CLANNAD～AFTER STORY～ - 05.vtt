Here.

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:07.354 position:5% line:83% align:start

you make it work.

It would be nice if
we could shed tears,

don't you think?

 Misae's cat sure does like you.

Actually, I think it's upset.

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:57.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
has Misae been practicing
her wrestling moves lately?

00:03:58.812 --> 00:04:01.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't even think
about doing that again!

00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:04.083 position:50% line:83% align:start
I-I promise.
Scout's honor...

00:04:04.183 --> 00:04:06.285 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sighs] Oh, hello!

00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:08.553 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I didn't notice
 you two standing there.

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:10.122 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry about that!

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:12.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's fine.
We were enjoying the show!

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.227 position:27% line:83% align:start
 [Youhei]
 Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:17.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why can't you be more gentle?

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:20.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
Such a big fuss over such
a little pounding...

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:23.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um...I feel like we might
have come at a bad time,

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:25.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
but we brought some dinner
for Sunohara.

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mom thought you might be
lonely with Mei gone

00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.007 position:5% line:83% align:start
and wanted to make sure you
weren't just eating katsudon.

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:31.574 position:16% line:89% align:start
For real?! Thank you!

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mei or no Mei,
I don't think Sunohara

00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:36.679 position:5% line:83% align:start
could ever feel lonely
in a place like this.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
No kidding. It's a little
too exciting sometimes.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:42.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stick around for a bit,
and I'll make you guys some tea.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:44.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a "thank you" for
protecting the cat.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.654 position:16% line:89% align:start
Protecting the cat?

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:47.256 position:5% line:83% align:start
That idiot tried
to run off with the cat

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:48.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
and sell it behind my back.

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:49.691 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just a stray,

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.159 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I thought if I went
to a pet shop,

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
they might give me
some cash for it.

00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:54.362 position:50% line:83% align:start
That's not how
pet shops work.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.164 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know,
I always forget to ask,

00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:57.731 position:16% line:89% align:start
but what's the kitty's name?

00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:58.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no name.

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
No name? How cute!

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:03.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aw! You're so sweet,
aren't you Little Miss Nono?

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I mean "no name" because I
haven't given it a name yet.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
And by the way, it's a boy,
not a girl.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:10.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mister Kitty
doesn't have a name.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? But he's
your pet, right?

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's here whenever we stop by.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, to be honest, I wasn't
planning on keeping him.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
He just started hanging around,

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:20.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I felt sort of obligated
to take care of him.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't say I'm his owner
or anything...

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Oh yeah?
Then why can't I sell him?

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:27.458 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you
were gonna stew him up!

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, but I might stew you.

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.797 position:38% line:89% align:start
Joke! It was a joke!

00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:34.266 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:37.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't help but notice that he
seems strangely attached to you.

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder why.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:41.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do your clothes smell of
catnip or something?

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:43.174 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, not to my knowledge.

00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:44.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[knock on door]
-Hm?

00:05:44.442 --> 00:05:45.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come in.

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.243 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Tomoyo] Hello.
-[Youhei yelps]

00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:49.446 position:16% line:83% align:start
I didn't know all
of you were here.

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:50.714 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Tomoyo!

00:05:50.814 --> 00:05:52.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's a surprise.
What are you doing here?

00:05:52.648 --> 00:05:54.616 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think it's anything
to be surprised about.

00:05:54.717 --> 00:05:56.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sakagami stops by to
chat with me all the time.

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought Misae
could teach me how to be

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
a better student
council president.

00:06:00.622 --> 00:06:01.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
But this is good.

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, Sunohara,

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:04.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wanted to talk to you
about something, too.

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.661 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Huh?

00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:08.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] No one was late
or absent for a whole week?

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] You haven't heard?
I thought everyone knew!

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:12.900 position:16% line:83% align:start
Misae isn't just
famous for being

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:14.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
our first female student
council president...

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:17.504 position:16% line:83% align:start
she also put together
the legendary school-wide

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:18.972 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Perfect Attendance Week."

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:21.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
That really brings
back some memories.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] I want to know how you
were able to unite

00:06:23.176 --> 00:06:24.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
the whole school like that.

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:25.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd like to give it
a shot myself,

00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:27.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'm not sure
where to start...

00:06:27.147 --> 00:06:29.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not easy,
I'll tell you that much.

00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:31.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, for one,
you might have trouble

00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:32.952 position:5% line:89% align:start
with a few "problem students."

00:06:33.052 --> 00:06:35.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Who could she be talking about?
-I don't know.

00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:37.023 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know he has a bad rep,

00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:38.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
but Tomoya gets up
early every morning

00:06:38.723 --> 00:06:40.159 position:16% line:89% align:start
and goes to school with me!

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
In that case, Sunohara
should be the only problem.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should come over
again to wake you up?

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, ma'am, I can
get up on my own.

00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:49.566 position:5% line:83% align:start
How did you do it, Misae?
Any tips?

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:51.702 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not really. I didn't
do anything special.

00:06:51.802 --> 00:06:53.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I just mentioned it at
 the morning assembly.

00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:55.205 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was something like,

00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:57.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Hey, guys, let's try not to
be late or absent next week."

00:06:57.841 --> 00:06:59.510 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Everyone thought
 it was a fun idea,

00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:01.045 position:50% line:83% align:start
so they all went
along with it.

00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:02.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
And that's all it took?

00:07:02.413 --> 00:07:05.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. If anything, it probably
worked as well as it did

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:07.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
because I didn't get too
excited about it.

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:09.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you mean,
"too excited"?

00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:11.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
With anything,
if you push too hard,

00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:13.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
then people will
start pushing back.

00:07:13.156 --> 00:07:15.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
Be into it,
but be laid back about it.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
That makes sense. Maybe I
should change my approach...

00:07:22.596 --> 00:07:23.532 position:50% line:89% align:start
Come in!

00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:25.733 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Good evening!
 [gasp]

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:27.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't worry
about them,

00:07:27.668 --> 00:07:29.236 position:27% line:83% align:start
they're just some
friends of mine.

00:07:29.336 --> 00:07:30.438 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Did you need something?

00:07:30.538 --> 00:07:32.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um... It's about the
you-know-what...

00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:35.042 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh. Yeah, that...

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:37.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here. Look.

00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.713 position:5% line:83% align:start
An Autumn Festival at a shrine.
And it's tomorrow?

00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:42.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a tradition where all
the locals get together

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:44.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
and pray for peace
and happiness.

00:07:44.783 --> 00:07:47.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
Might be nice for a first date,
don't you think?

00:07:47.387 --> 00:07:50.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
[rugby player] Oh, I-I get it!
I gotta hand it to you, Misae,

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:52.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're a real lifesaver!

00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:54.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's asking her
about good date spots.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
Cut it out. Eavesdropping
is totally creepy!

[Nagisa] She's right!
You have to respect his privacy!

 Come on, it's fine!

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.569 position:38% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much!

00:08:03.668 --> 00:08:05.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
No prob. Any time.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara was listening in
on your dating advice

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
and being a creep about it.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:16.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
Shh!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.115 position:27% line:89% align:start

[grunt]

00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:25.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] It looks like a lot
of students depend on you,

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:26.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
just like when you
were in high school.

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:27.923 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] I think it's great.

00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:29.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wish I could be
more like that.

00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:31.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know why,
but for some reason

00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:33.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
people have always
come to me for advice.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:34.729 position:5% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] What can I say?

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:36.731 position:27% line:83% align:start
It just means you're
popular, that's all.

00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seems like everyone
in my class loves you too.

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:39.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
 You have a lot of fans!

00:08:40.068 --> 00:08:42.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm glad people still
like me at least.

00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:44.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though I'm not quite
sure what they see

00:08:44.172 --> 00:08:47.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
in a woman who scolds
people all the time.

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:48.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's not like that...

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:49.977 position:38% line:83% align:start
I mean, it's not
that you scold them,

00:08:50.077 --> 00:08:51.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
 it's that you worry about them.

00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:54.047 position:27% line:83% align:start
 They know you only
 do it because you care.

00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:55.715 position:27% line:83% align:start
The rugby guys are
always talking about

00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:56.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
how nice you smell, too.

00:08:57.049 --> 00:08:58.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Like bodywash, or whatever.

00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:01.154 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know that sounds like kind
of a weird compliment...

00:09:01.254 --> 00:09:03.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
but the thing is,
in a dorm full of filthy guys,

00:09:03.556 --> 00:09:04.789 position:16% line:89% align:start
  you're like a princess...

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.758 position:27% line:83% align:start
Like a diamond in
a dunghill, I guess.

00:09:06.858 --> 00:09:08.660 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm always
scolding people...

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I'm always worrying
about them...

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.399 position:38% line:89% align:start
and I smell nice...

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:15.600 position:16% line:89% align:start
I say something wrong?

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:17.269 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh. Oh no, I'm fine.

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:20.572 position:5% line:83% align:start

a long time ago, that's all.

00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.041 position:38% line:83% align:start
I was just thinking
about that.

00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:26.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Thanks for everything.
Sorry for taking up your time.

00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:29.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's no problem.
Come by any time you like.

00:09:29.812 --> 00:09:31.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
See you later.

00:09:34.884 --> 00:09:37.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sunohara... be a good boy
and go back to your room.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
But why? I've still got
another hour or two

00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:40.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
before it's lights out.

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:43.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to talk to Furukawa,
that's why.

00:09:43.393 --> 00:09:44.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're not needed here.

00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:47.996 position:27% line:83% align:start
I get it, but did you
have to be so blunt?

00:09:49.031 --> 00:09:50.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] You want me
to go to this?

00:09:50.998 --> 00:09:53.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right.
Sunohara told me everything.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
That is to say, he told me
that you hardly ever

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
take Furukawa out on a date.

00:09:57.673 --> 00:10:00.107 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey, that's between
me and Nagisa!

00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:01.642 position:5% line:83% align:start
You say that,
but don't blame me

00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:03.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
if some other guy snatches
her away from you.

00:10:04.077 --> 00:10:05.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
Something like that
would never happen!

00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:08.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya's the only guy
who can snatch me up!

00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:13.819 position:5% line:89% align:start
There. Did you hear that?

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.788 position:5% line:83% align:start
It takes a special kind
of girl to say that

00:10:15.888 --> 00:10:17.122 position:5% line:89% align:start
about a guy like you.

00:10:17.223 --> 00:10:18.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whatever! Do we have
to talk about this now?!

00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:21.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seeing you reminds me of my
life back in high school.

00:10:21.726 --> 00:10:24.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, that's all like
ancient history now.

00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:26.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Don't say something like that,

00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:27.999 position:5% line:89% align:start
Misae, you're still young!

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:30.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's sweet of you...
but it's fine.

but now that I'm an adult,

00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:37.642 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's my job to look
after kids like you.

[gasps]

00:10:39.743 --> 00:10:41.445 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, anyway...

00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:44.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
why don't you two stick around
and chat for a bit longer?

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:46.083 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll go make some tea.

00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:50.286 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, I have a question!

00:10:50.387 --> 00:10:51.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
What was our school like

00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:53.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
back when you were the
student council president?

00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:56.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
It wasn't anything special.
Just a normal school.

00:10:56.626 --> 00:10:59.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
 [Nagisa] I bet you had
 a whole bunch of friends, huh?

00:10:59.428 --> 00:11:00.730 position:5% line:89% align:start
I had my fair share.

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:02.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
We had so much fun back then.

00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:04.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, we had
our troubles, too,

00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:06.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
but that's what
made life so exciting.

00:11:06.368 --> 00:11:09.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then again, I suppose things
are still pretty exciting now.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.452 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please, I can't leave
until you tell me!

00:13:15.552 --> 00:13:19.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay then, I wish that you'd
get out of my sight!

00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:20.156 position:5% line:89% align:start
No good?

00:13:20.256 --> 00:13:21.924 position:50% line:83% align:start
If that's really
your only wish,

00:13:22.024 --> 00:13:23.925 position:38% line:83% align:start
then I'll go away
and leave you alone.

00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:27.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I came here because
I wanted to do you a favor.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the least I could do after
all you've done for me...

00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:34.469 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:37.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shima] We met back
when I was in grade school.

00:13:37.104 --> 00:13:40.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your mom was in
the hospital and so was I.

00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:42.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were coming to
visit her that day.

00:13:42.276 --> 00:13:44.880 position:5% line:83% align:start
At the time, I was out
in the courtyard.

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:48.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
We started to talk
and you really cheered me up.

00:13:48.783 --> 00:13:50.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess you really don't
remember, huh?

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.654 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was in a wheelchair
and I had a cat with me.

00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:56.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -No, I remember now.
 -Really?

00:13:57.023 --> 00:13:58.957 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but I didn't
do anything special.

00:13:59.057 --> 00:14:01.126 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just sat and talked
to you for a little bit.

00:14:01.226 --> 00:14:02.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
But it meant a lot to me!

00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:04.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
You might not feel like
you said anything big,

00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:06.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
but you gave me
a lot of courage!

00:14:06.398 --> 00:14:08.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
Okay, but what
did I say, again?

00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:11.135 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, let's see...

00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:13.271 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't remember.

00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:15.239 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it sure did make my day,
whatever it was!

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:17.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I gotta pay
you back, no matter what!

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:20.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right,
then buy me a soda, okay?

00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:21.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:21.512 --> 00:14:22.413 position:38% line:89% align:start
 That'll be enough.

00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:24.181 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't do all
that much for you,

00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you don't have to do that
much for me in return, okay?

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think you understand
what I'm saying.

00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:30.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can grant
you any wish, anything at all!

00:14:31.087 --> 00:14:32.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know it's hard to believe,

00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:34.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I have something with the
power to do that.

00:14:34.524 --> 00:14:36.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to hold back
or be polite or anything!

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just tell me
what you really want!

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.062 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're not making sense.

00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:41.697 position:27% line:83% align:start
What, do you have some
kind of magic lamp?

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:44.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not a lamp, but he said it
has the power to grant wishes.

00:14:44.966 --> 00:14:46.302 position:61% line:89% align:start
  Who said?

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:47.770 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.871 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
 -Don't know.
 -Uh!

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.541 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're a weird little boy,
you know that?

00:14:53.641 --> 00:14:54.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
You think so?

00:14:54.843 --> 00:14:56.511 position:16% line:89% align:start
And quite the romantic, too.

00:14:56.611 --> 00:14:58.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
No offense, kid,

00:14:58.111 --> 00:15:00.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'm not the type to
believe in that sort of thing.

00:15:00.113 --> 00:15:01.615 position:16% line:89% align:start
H-hold on!

00:15:01.716 --> 00:15:04.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, I appreciate you coming
all the way here to thank me.

00:15:04.818 --> 00:15:07.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you're all better
and I'm glad I could help.

00:15:07.154 --> 00:15:10.022 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take care, okay? Bye.

00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:13.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:15:13.326 --> 00:15:14.962 position:16% line:89% align:start
He a friend of yours, Misae?

00:15:15.061 --> 00:15:16.329 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wow, he's cute.

00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:18.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd ditch Igarashi and go
for this one instead.

00:15:18.598 --> 00:15:19.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
You...

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:22.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just can't take "no"
for an answer, can you?

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:24.135 position:16% line:89% align:start
I-it hurts! I can't breathe!

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:27.072 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's great, what are Saki
and Yuki supposed to think?

00:15:27.172 --> 00:15:29.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now there's gonna be
all kinds of rumors!

00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:30.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
Rumors? About what?

00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.744 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's some boy
waiting for me at my school

00:15:32.844 --> 00:15:33.945 position:16% line:89% align:start
first thing in the morning.

00:15:34.044 --> 00:15:35.579 position:38% line:83% align:start
What do you <i>think</i>
they'd be about?!

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:15:37.248 --> 00:15:38.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're in love
with that guy Igarashi

00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:39.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you don't want me
to ruin it.

00:15:40.084 --> 00:15:42.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ugh! You don't beat around
the bush, do you?

00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:45.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're pretty cute, Misae, I
think it'll work out just fine.

00:15:45.488 --> 00:15:47.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know! Let's go ask him out!

00:15:47.423 --> 00:15:49.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll go with you.
It'll be fun!

00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:51.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What's wrong with you?!
-Huh?

00:15:51.928 --> 00:15:56.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
 I can ask him out on my own!
 Why would I want your help?!

00:15:57.432 --> 00:15:58.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.735 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen, you twerp,

00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:01.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
you said you came here
to grant me a wish, right?

00:16:01.436 --> 00:16:04.806 position:38% line:83% align:start
 So why do you keep
 getting in my way?!

00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:07.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then your wish is for Igarashi
to fall in love with you?

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.577 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that what you want?

00:16:11.546 --> 00:16:13.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -No, that's not good.
 -Why not?

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:17.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Because it's not right to play
 with other people's hearts.

00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:23.723 position:5% line:89% align:start
Welcome back.

00:16:23.823 --> 00:16:25.859 position:38% line:83% align:start
You could've said
"hello" first.

00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:27.827 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't you take a hint? Go home!

00:16:27.928 --> 00:16:29.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, Misae. You've got quite

00:16:29.428 --> 00:16:31.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
the little stalker
following you around.

00:16:31.463 --> 00:16:32.766 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your name's Shima, right?

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:35.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, Misae's already
in love with someone else.

00:16:35.134 --> 00:16:37.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
If Igarashi saw you two
together, he might, uh...

00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:40.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
  -[Igarashi] What about me?
  -[gasps]

00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:42.307 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Sagara's boyfriend is here.

00:16:42.407 --> 00:16:44.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
I never got a proper
introduction.

00:16:44.342 --> 00:16:47.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, no, no! That's not it!
You got it all wrong!

00:16:50.448 --> 00:16:52.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder if he
understood or not...

00:16:52.482 --> 00:16:54.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's nothing to worry about.

00:16:54.484 --> 00:16:57.021 position:5% line:83% align:start
Given the right chance,
I'm sure Igarashi will like you

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
just as much as you like him.

00:17:00.023 --> 00:17:01.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, I don't
really get you at all.

00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:03.627 position:38% line:89% align:start
  What do you mean?

00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:05.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's like you're helping me
get together with another boy.

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:08.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't feel jealous
or left behind or anything?

00:17:08.898 --> 00:17:10.566 position:72% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:15.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, I... I'm not interested
in that sort of thing.

00:17:18.373 --> 00:17:20.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's one thing about you
I don't mind, at least.

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:21.843 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [slight gasp]

00:17:21.943 --> 00:17:22.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even if you're a pest,

00:17:23.044 --> 00:17:25.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're so innocent and sweet.

00:17:40.995 --> 00:17:42.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to
catch cold or what?

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.731 position:16% line:83% align:start
  -[screaming]
  -Give me a break!

00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:47.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's raining cats and dogs and
you left your umbrella at home?!

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:50.435 position:16% line:83% align:start
I didn't know! It wasn't
raining like this earlier!

00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:51.771 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look at me, wasting my time
taking care of some brat...

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:56.208 position:61% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:57.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you're going to apologize,

00:17:57.909 --> 00:18:00.378 position:5% line:83% align:start
then don't make me do this
in the first place!

00:18:00.478 --> 00:18:03.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here, I borrowed a track suit.
Change clothes.

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.884 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're hopeless, you know that?

00:18:06.984 --> 00:18:08.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
Besides, I thought
you had the power

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:09.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
to grant any wish you wanted.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you just
stop the rain?

00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:12.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
I couldn't do that!

00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:14.658 position:5% line:83% align:start
I only get one wish,
so if I wasted it on the rain,

00:18:14.758 --> 00:18:17.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
then I wouldn't be able
to pay you back!

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
I still don't understand why you
feel like you owe me so much.

00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:23.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't even remember
what I said to you back then.

00:18:23.298 --> 00:18:25.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
What you said to me
wasn't the important part.

00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:27.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
 The fact that you said
 anything was more than enough.

00:18:27.603 --> 00:18:30.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
  Your optimism started
  to wear off on me.

00:18:30.406 --> 00:18:32.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I admit,
I get that a lot.

00:18:32.741 --> 00:18:33.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
After I met you,

00:18:34.076 --> 00:18:36.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
I felt like I could do anything
if I put my heart into it.

00:18:36.644 --> 00:18:39.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that's why I have to return
the favor, no matter what.

00:18:40.848 --> 00:18:43.685 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [schoolbell rings]

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:49.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have class. I gotta go.
Try to sneak out quietly, okay?

00:18:49.256 --> 00:18:50.590 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.799 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Igarashi]
Hey, it's Sagara's boyfriend.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.034 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hm?

00:19:01.134 --> 00:19:02.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
Waiting for her to
get out, as usual?

00:19:02.835 --> 00:19:06.371 position:16% line:83% align:start
Um, you got it all wrong;
I'm not her boyfriend.

00:19:06.472 --> 00:19:07.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're just a friend?

00:19:07.807 --> 00:19:09.175 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Uh, the thing is,

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.843 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sagara's already in love
with someone else...

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.645 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:17.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but I need
to ask a favor of you.

00:19:17.515 --> 00:19:18.883 position:50% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] Hey there.
What's with the long face?

00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:30.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait, don't tell me you
really did catch a cold...

00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:31.527 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:19:31.627 --> 00:19:33.262 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then why do you look so upset?

00:19:33.362 --> 00:19:34.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something happen?

00:19:36.232 --> 00:19:38.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Igarashi] I know how
Sagara feels about me.

00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:41.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
But as you can see, I already
have a girlfriend.

00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:43.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is there some way
you could, maybe,

00:19:43.172 --> 00:19:44.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
break the news to her gently?

00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:46.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:19:46.408 --> 00:19:48.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to be
so nice to everyone.

00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:50.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's just how I am.
I can't help it.

00:19:50.912 --> 00:19:52.080 position:27% line:89% align:start
  You can do it, right?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.348 position:38% line:83% align:start
I don't want to
hurt her feelings...

00:19:56.017 --> 00:19:59.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] Come on, what happened?
Don't be shy, you can tell me!

00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:03.389 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you fall in love
with someone, maybe?

00:20:03.924 --> 00:20:05.325 position:72% line:89% align:start
 Maybe.

00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasp] For real?

00:20:07.494 --> 00:20:10.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was just asking you
as a joke...

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if that's the case,
then why are you so upset?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm upset because
I have to give that person

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:20.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
I might be in love with
some really sad news.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:21.807 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that?

00:20:21.907 --> 00:20:23.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
That person is...

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:25.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
she's already in love with
another boy.

00:20:25.611 --> 00:20:27.980 position:16% line:83% align:start
But the... the boy
that she's in love with...

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.249 position:16% line:89% align:start
already has a girlfriend.

00:20:30.348 --> 00:20:33.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that boy asked me
to pass the news to her.

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:36.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
That sounds pretty
complicated to me.

00:20:36.587 --> 00:20:38.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it could be
your big chance, right?

00:20:38.823 --> 00:20:39.957 position:83% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:40.057 --> 00:20:42.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure, on the downside, the
girl's heart will probably

00:20:42.292 --> 00:20:43.960 position:5% line:83% align:start
be broken when you tell
her the news...

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.696 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if you make her feel better,
she might fall in love with you.

00:20:46.797 --> 00:20:49.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on, Shima, turn around.
Don't be so upset.

00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:51.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Think positive, okay?

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
This could be the perfect
opportunity for you to-

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.738 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no way I could
do something like that!

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:56.806 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:20:56.906 --> 00:20:58.507 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [sobbing]

00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:02.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
  If you were in my shoes,
  is that what you'd think?

00:21:02.443 --> 00:21:05.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a chance for you?
It's a good thing?

00:21:05.547 --> 00:21:08.316 position:38% line:83% align:start
Even though you
care for them...

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:11.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even though they just had
their heart broken...

00:21:11.586 --> 00:21:13.487 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would you do that to them?

00:21:13.587 --> 00:21:15.622 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, I... I'm sorry.

00:21:15.722 --> 00:21:18.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was just trying to be
positive, that's all.

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:20.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
It sounded like the kind of
thing my friends would say to me

00:21:20.594 --> 00:21:22.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
if I was upset.
[gasp]

00:21:28.668 --> 00:21:30.603 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Huh?

00:21:40.412 --> 00:21:42.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shima, were you
talking about...

00:21:45.482 --> 00:21:49.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see... I was such a fool.

00:21:52.623 --> 00:21:54.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't get it.
Why are you crying?

00:21:54.992 --> 00:21:56.961 position:50% line:89% align:start
 I don't know...

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:47.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shima] <i>He was someone</i>
 <i>very special to me.</i>

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:49.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Someone I spent a</i>
 <i>long time with.</i>

00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:55.535 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>I remember his words...</i>

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:57.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>But he's gone now.</i>

00:23:57.971 --> 00:24:00.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>He entrusted me</i>
 <i>with his final wish.</i>

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>The reason I came here</i>
 <i>was to grant him that wish.</i>

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:07.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>And now that I've seen the</i>
 <i>world through his eyes...</i>

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:10.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I understand why</i>
 <i>it was so important.</i>
