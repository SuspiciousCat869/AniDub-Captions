[Tomoya]: I was only living
because it was too much trouble
to die.

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:21.083 position:13% line:83% align:start
I got up in the morning...
I went to work...

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
I ate dinner...
and I went to sleep at night.

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:28.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's like my body
was doing it out of habit.

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:31.720 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's how I lived
every day of my life.

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:38.256 position:27% line:83% align:start
I worked my body
to the absolute limit.

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:43.057 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wanted to forget everything,

00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:48.160 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I let work swallow my
life... swallow everything.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.394 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: Okazaki, Why don't you
call it a night? It's late.

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:54.694 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's fine. I'll be done
in just a second.

00:00:54.694 --> 00:00:56.129 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, don't get me wrong,

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.929 position:21% line:83% align:start
I appreciate all the
work you do for us...

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
but if you keep pushing
yourself like that you're going

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
to end up making yourself sick.

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:04.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, you're not even
taking time off for Obon.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about me.
I'm doing it because I want to.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't take off every once
in a while, you're going to

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:12.269 position:24% line:83% align:start
get me in trouble
with the government.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.770 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
After work was rough on me.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was even worse
when I had a day off.

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:26.407 position:10% line:83% align:start
I would throw my money away
just to kill time...

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:28.974 position:16% line:89% align:start
to stay away from home.

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:31.509 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was hiding from reality
because that was the only thing

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.176 position:21% line:89% align:start
holding me together.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
I hate this town.

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:40.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
But even if I moved away, I
wouldn't have anywhere to go...

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:42.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't have anything to do.

00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:44.847 position:5% line:89% align:start
I tried to shut everything out.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:47.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
To live without
thinking of anything.

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:10.156 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanted to wipe my mind clean.

00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:13.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wanted to forget
what happened.

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:18.026 position:10% line:83% align:start
Everything I did was wrong.
Everything was a mistake.

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.528 position:10% line:89% align:start
@The fact that I met her...

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:26.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
The fact that we fell in love...
that we got married...

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
The fact that we had a baby...

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:33.431 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was all one big mistake
I couldn't take back.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:13.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
["I"]: It takes a wish for
this junk to take shape.

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:16.035 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe that's why
I can't do it alone.

00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:19.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
No... I knew that's
what it needed...

00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:23.071 position:19% line:89% align:start
a wish from the heart.

00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:25.272 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's why I needed her.

00:04:25.272 --> 00:04:29.807 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because I didn't have a heart...
Because I wasn't human.

00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:41.811 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're crying, aren't you?

00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.812 position:10% line:83% align:start
@Is it cause youúremembered
something sad?

00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:49.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
@This world is aúsad
place, isn't it?

00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:57.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
Soon, everything here
will be buried in white.

00:04:57.584 --> 00:05:00.552 position:19% line:83% align:start
It'll get even colder
and I'll stop moving.

00:05:00.552 --> 00:05:04.852 position:16% line:77% align:start
@Then you'll be left all
aloneúin this cold, white
wasteland.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.725 position:27% line:89% align:start
[doorbell rings]

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:29.828 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.363 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hi Tomoya! How are you doing?

00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:33.631 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sanae...?

00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:36.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
Were you sleeping?
Sorry if I came at a bad time.

00:05:36.164 --> 00:05:38.064 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. It's fine. No problem.

00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:39.666 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Are you alone?

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:42.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yep. Just me, myself, and I.

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:44.967 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh, sorry, could you
hold on just a sec?

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:47.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
This apartment's a mess.
Lemme clean up real fast.

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:56.672 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: It certainly is hot
out there today, isn't it?

00:05:56.672 --> 00:05:58.139 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still, even if it's
a little unpleasant,

00:05:59.473 --> 00:06:01.340 position:30% line:83% align:start
you can't stay
inside all day long.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Yoshino tells me
the same thing-

00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:05.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
he says I need to get out more.

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:07.709 position:10% line:83% align:start
But still.. There's no point
in going out by myself

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:09.176 position:24% line:89% align:start
on such a hot day.

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:11.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: Then how about
going on a date with me?

00:06:11.277 --> 00:06:12.177 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:14.445 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: What's gotten
into you all of a sudden?

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:19.413 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]: What do you mean? Every
once in a while, I feel like
going out

00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:21.947 position:21% line:83% align:start
with a younger guy.
What's wrong with that?

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.081 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Whether it's wrong or
not, I think you should've
picked

00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.283 position:19% line:89% align:start
someone other than me.

00:06:25.283 --> 00:06:27.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: Why would you say that?

00:06:27.116 --> 00:06:29.751 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're sweet, funny,
and really handsome, too.

00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why should I settle
for anyone else?

00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:33.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: I don't
think I'm that great.

00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:35.952 position:19% line:83% align:start
I feel like I'm always
taking advantage of you.

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:44.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hardly recognize
this place anymore.

00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:47.090 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I take it you don't come
by the station very often?

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.958 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, I stay on my side of town.

00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:55.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
You haven't had time off
in so long.

00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:58.528 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why don't you take a vacation
for a week or two?

00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:00.828 position:10% line:83% align:start
Actually, the company keeps
nagging me to take time off.

00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:02.596 position:13% line:89% align:start
I think they'd love that.

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:05.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
Great! Then why don't
we take a trip somewhere?

00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:07.164 position:30% line:83% align:start
What, you mean
just the two of us?

00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:09.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
I might be crazy enough
to agree to that.

00:07:09.165 --> 00:07:11.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:14.900 position:16% line:83% align:start
But for this trip, I was
thinking everyone could go.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
Who's "everyone"?

00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:18.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
You know! Everyone!

00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:22.670 position:10% line:83% align:start
[giggles] C'mon, Mom, hurry!
Let's get some juice!

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.104 position:7% line:83% align:start
Use your inside voice, you're
bothering the other people.

00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:30.139 position:30% line:83% align:start
You know, Akio
really misses you, too.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's always talking
about getting together

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.273 position:10% line:89% align:start
and having a drink with you.

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:34.874 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's not the problem...

00:07:34.874 --> 00:07:37.908 position:10% line:89% align:start
You worry too much! Come on!

00:07:37.908 --> 00:07:40.376 position:7% line:89% align:start
I dunno; I'll think about it.

00:07:43.744 --> 00:07:46.211 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:07:49.713 --> 00:07:53.248 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]: It's Sanae. Have you
made up your mind about the
trip?

00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:55.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, not yet. I still need
to think about it.

00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:59.083 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]ÚAll right. Then keep
thinking@and I'll call you back
later.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.351 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:04.419 position:27% line:83% align:start
Really wants me
to go on that trip...

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:05.485 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.353 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:11.187 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: So,
have you thought about it yet?

00:08:11.187 --> 00:08:13.921 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Fine, Sanae. You win.

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:16.022 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]ÚThen I take
it that's a yes?

00:08:16.022 --> 00:08:19.023 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sure. Okay, I'll take
the end of next week off

00:08:19.023 --> 00:08:21.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I can have a four-day
weekend, including Sunday.

00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:23.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
Will that do the trick?

00:08:23.024 --> 00:08:26.126 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]ÚThat's
perfect! Thank you!

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:34.496 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Of course, I wasn't
sure if I really wanted to go.

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:36.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I felt like I'd
be betraying Sanae

00:08:36.563 --> 00:08:39.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
if I turned her down
for something so simple.

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:41.498 position:7% line:89% align:start
@She's done so much for me...

00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:44.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
the least I could doúis
go on one little trip.

00:08:54.503 --> 00:08:55.869 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: I'm here!

00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:59.305 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sanae, hello?

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:03.906 position:38% line:89% align:start
Old man?

00:09:15.944 --> 00:09:18.111 position:27% line:83% align:start
Looks like they
left me a note...

00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:22.180 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]: Dear Tomoya... I'm
sorry, but something sudden just
came up.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid Akio and I
had to leave.

00:09:24.214 --> 00:09:26.848 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please take care of things
while we're gone.

00:09:26.848 --> 00:09:28.582 position:33% line:89% align:start
Love, Sanae.

00:09:30.882 --> 00:09:33.384 position:10% line:89% align:start
Y-you're kidding me, right?

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:59.326 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

[footsteps]

00:10:00.294 --> 00:10:01.227 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:10:19.234 --> 00:10:20.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio?

00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:56.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
Stop hiding. You don't
have to be so nervous.

00:10:56.247 --> 00:10:58.181 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, come on out, okay?

00:11:01.583 --> 00:11:05.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
So Sanae and the old man
had to leave, huh?

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.418 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are we gonna do?

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:08.786 position:27% line:89% align:start
@I want Sanae...

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:12.019 position:21% line:83% align:start
Didn't you hear me?
I just said Sanae isn't here.

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.387 position:27% line:89% align:start
@I want Akki...

00:11:13.387 --> 00:11:16.054 position:7% line:89% align:start
The old man's not here either.

00:11:21.523 --> 00:11:22.591 position:16% line:89% align:start
You gotta be kidding me.

00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:23.791 position:30% line:83% align:start
What, did they
just leave without

00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:25.191 position:10% line:89% align:start
telling you anything at all?

00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:30.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: So what
do you want to do?

00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:32.827 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wanna go on a trip...

00:11:32.827 --> 00:11:34.395 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that ain't happening.

00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:36.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sanae and the old man
are gone, remember?

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you wanna go on a
trip alone, is that it?

00:11:39.563 --> 00:11:42.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
@No, I wanna goúwith
Sanae and Akki!

00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:44.898 position:13% line:89% align:start
What did I just tell you?

00:12:00.103 --> 00:12:02.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
What the hell am I
supposed to do...?

00:12:08.507 --> 00:12:11.007 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sanae and the old man have
been taking care of Ushio

00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:13.509 position:16% line:89% align:start
for the past five years.

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:15.576 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was at work on her
first day of kindergarten

00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:19.411 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I didn't even take her
to the Shichi-Go-San festival.

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:21.645 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sanae would bring her over
to my apartment sometimes,

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:23.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I hardly even looked at her.

00:12:23.945 --> 00:12:26.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're more like
strangers than family.

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:30.915 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to hide from me?
I can still see you...

00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:41.653 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't just stand there.
Come sit with me.

00:12:50.922 --> 00:12:52.956 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can sit down.

00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:56.858 position:24% line:89% align:start
Have it your way.

00:12:56.858 --> 00:12:58.626 position:30% line:89% align:start
Anyway, uhh...

00:12:58.626 --> 00:13:00.726 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wherever the heck they went,
I'm sure the old man and Sanae

00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:02.827 position:10% line:89% align:start
will be back later tonight.

00:13:02.827 --> 00:13:06.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
For now, let's just stay
here and wait. Sound good?

00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:08.295 position:27% line:89% align:start
But the trip...

00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:10.863 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'm sure
you can go somewhere nice

00:13:10.863 --> 00:13:12.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
after they get back.

00:13:12.264 --> 00:13:13.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until then, why don't
you play by yourself?

00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:15.498 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:20.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess she's kind
of a tomboy, huh?

00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:21.600 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crash]

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:24.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio!

00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:33.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's what you get for
running in the house.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.405 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you hurt yourself?

00:13:34.405 --> 00:13:36.305 position:13% line:89% align:start
You get a scrape anywhere?

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:40.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like you're inúgood shape.
Be careful, okay?

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:57.447 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is that the toy
you were playing with?

00:13:57.447 --> 00:13:58.781 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh. Seems like poor Mr. Turtle
didn't survive the fall.

00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:05.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry... Mr. Turtle...

00:14:09.485 --> 00:14:13.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nothing a little glue
can't fix up, right?

00:14:13.453 --> 00:14:16.620 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hang on a sec.
I'll put it back together.

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:35.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can still see the crack, but
it's not all that noticeable.

00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:38.261 position:19% line:83% align:start
Beats having its head
torn off at least.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.029 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't play with it
till it dries.

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:44.430 position:30% line:83% align:start
Otherwise the
wheels'll get stuck.

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:48.899 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did she understand what I said?

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:50.566 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's not my problem.

00:14:59.703 --> 00:15:01.002 position:13% line:89% align:start
What, is something wrong?

00:15:01.002 --> 00:15:03.970 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mr. Turtle won't move anymore.

00:15:07.171 --> 00:15:09.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Ah, I thought so!

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:12.273 position:10% line:77% align:start
@I told you not to play with
itúuntil the glue dried, didn't
I?

00:15:12.273 --> 00:15:14.708 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Well, it's busted. The
wheelúwon't turn anymore. Sorry.

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:16.975 position:16% line:89% align:start
You can't fix him again?

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:19.143 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Nope, he's done.úAs
good as dead.

00:15:19.143 --> 00:15:21.077 position:24% line:83% align:start
@What should I do
now?úThrow him in the trash?

00:15:21.077 --> 00:15:24.011 position:19% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Mmm-mmm, mmm!

00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:25.745 position:16% line:89% align:start
@Hey, I'mújust kidding.

00:15:33.348 --> 00:15:35.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Hm? Is thereúsomething
else you want?

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.050 position:30% line:89% align:start
I want Sanae.

00:15:38.817 --> 00:15:40.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
@What, isúshe back now?

00:15:40.518 --> 00:15:42.618 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, she's gone.

00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:45.252 position:35% line:89% align:start
@I see...

00:15:49.688 --> 00:15:51.455 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm getting hungry...

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:58.958 position:21% line:77% align:start
@I'll go buy us some
dinner.úAnything in particular
you want?

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
@If you don't give
meúa suggestion,

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.091 position:13% line:89% align:start
@then youúcan't complain!

00:16:06.827 --> 00:16:10.161 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Isogai]: Okazaki,
I haven't seen you in ages!

00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:11.929 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, hello.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
@Aren't you aúlucky girl, Ushio?

00:16:14.163 --> 00:16:15.997 position:10% line:83% align:start
@Are you going shoppingúwith
your Daddy today?

00:16:15.997 --> 00:16:17.264 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:17.264 --> 00:16:19.131 position:16% line:89% align:start
W-when did you get here?

00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:22.132 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry to hear that the two
of you have been living apart.

00:16:22.132 --> 00:16:23.666 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not that I blame you.

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know you work full-time
and it's hard for a child

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:27.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
to grow up in a
single-parent home.

00:16:27.568 --> 00:16:30.369 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, but you do visit each
other sometimes, don't you?

00:16:30.369 --> 00:16:33.003 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah... Once in a while.

00:16:33.003 --> 00:16:34.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Of course; I'músure
you'd be lonely

00:16:34.537 --> 00:16:36.505 position:7% line:89% align:start
@if you didn'túsee each other.

00:16:36.505 --> 00:16:39.606 position:7% line:83% align:start
@Even if you live apart, úyou
two are still family, right?

00:16:39.606 --> 00:16:41.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh... y-yeah, of course.

00:16:43.674 --> 00:16:47.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bye-bye Ushio! You have
fun with your Daddy!

00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:00.680 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:04.481 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Here. Eat up.

00:17:06.148 --> 00:17:07.582 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, help yourself.

00:17:07.582 --> 00:17:09.717 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're a big girl;
You can eat on your own.

00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:13.451 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm grateful for this meal.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.056 position:35% line:89% align:start
Bitter...

00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:30.525 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's bitter?

00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:37.426 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh. It's the pepper, huh?

00:17:37.426 --> 00:17:39.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but you can't
expect me to make fried rice

00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:41.695 position:16% line:83% align:start
without pepper; Just be
a good girl and eat it.

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:42.829 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nuh-uh.

00:17:42.829 --> 00:17:44.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, Ushio, give me a break,

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
didn't Sanae teach you
not to be a picky eater?

00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:51.698 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but the food Sanae cooks
me isn't all icky.

00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:53.666 position:21% line:89% align:start
Fine. Don't eat it.

00:18:04.403 --> 00:18:07.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
Would you eat it if
I take the pepper out?

00:18:07.638 --> 00:18:08.805 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:18:08.805 --> 00:18:11.006 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it might taste
even worse if I do that.

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.373 position:41% line:89% align:start
Rice.

00:18:12.373 --> 00:18:14.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
What kind? You just
want some plain rice?

00:18:14.807 --> 00:18:16.207 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:18:16.207 --> 00:18:19.009 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, well
that's easy for me...

00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:21.576 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Here you go. Plain rice.

00:18:21.576 --> 00:18:24.110 position:35% line:77% align:start
That's an
interestingúcombination you got
there...

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.845 position:19% line:89% align:start
fried rice with rice.

00:18:25.845 --> 00:18:27.578 position:41% line:89% align:start
Blegh!

00:18:27.578 --> 00:18:31.413 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]ÚWhat do you think
you're doing?! I just want this.

00:18:31.413 --> 00:18:33.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
If that's all you eat,
while I'm eating fried rice,

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.381 position:27% line:83% align:start
then it'll look
like child abuse.

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:50.287 position:21% line:89% align:start
Seasoning now, huh?

00:18:53.254 --> 00:18:55.656 position:10% line:89% align:start
I am grateful for this meal.

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:09.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: I'm starting to think
they're not coming home tonight.

00:19:29.734 --> 00:19:31.302 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're up too, huh?

00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:34.037 position:30% line:89% align:start
I gotta pee...

00:19:34.037 --> 00:19:35.603 position:30% line:89% align:start
Then go ahead.

00:19:45.907 --> 00:19:47.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
I did it all by myself.

00:19:47.741 --> 00:19:49.675 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, I should hope so.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
@[Father]Ú[laughs] We'll
go@swimming later, okay?

00:20:00.946 --> 00:20:02.880 position:24% line:83% align:start
@[Boy]ÚDaddy, are
you@gonna swim with us?

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Father]: You bet I am.
I used to be on the swim team.

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:08.682 position:41% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:20:08.682 --> 00:20:09.381 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:11.082 position:19% line:89% align:start
I gotta go number two.

00:20:11.082 --> 00:20:12.550 position:30% line:89% align:start
Then go ahead.

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:32.891 position:16% line:89% align:start
I did it all by myself.

00:20:32.891 --> 00:20:35.191 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't have to brag
about it every single time.

00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:37.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can do it by myself,
too, you know.

00:20:45.094 --> 00:20:47.063 position:7% line:89% align:start
You still wanna go on a trip?

00:20:47.063 --> 00:20:49.163 position:35% line:89% align:start
I sure do!

00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:51.698 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, what if it's
just you and me?

00:20:52.898 --> 00:20:54.532 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:20:54.532 --> 00:20:57.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
You sure? Even with
a mean guy like me?

00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:59.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sanae and the old man
won't be coming, you know.

00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:02.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
They can't. They
haven't come back yet.

00:21:02.234 --> 00:21:03.935 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's kind of
strange, isn't it?

00:21:03.935 --> 00:21:05.869 position:7% line:89% align:start
They just left us alone, huh?

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:07.169 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yup.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, just
the two of us, then.

00:21:10.972 --> 00:21:12.438 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:21:21.475 --> 00:21:22.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
Didn't forget anything, did you?

00:21:22.942 --> 00:21:24.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nuh-uh.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make sure the doors were locked?

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.577 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:28.143 position:27% line:89% align:start
Then off we go!

00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:30.178 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:21:38.781 --> 00:21:40.315 position:19% line:89% align:start
I guess it's strange,

00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:42.148 position:13% line:83% align:start
but Sanae and the old man
have always been around

00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:44.450 position:24% line:89% align:start
when I saw Ushio.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.985 position:7% line:83% align:start
I didn't realize it until now,
but in the five years

00:21:46.985 --> 00:21:50.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
since Ushio was born,
this is the first time

00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:52.119 position:5% line:89% align:start
we've ever been alone together.

00:21:59.055 --> 00:22:03.457 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wonder what this means...
I wonder where we're headed.

00:23:45.028 --> 00:23:48.828 position:7% line:83% align:start
Shut up! There's other people
on this train, you know!

00:23:48.828 --> 00:23:51.030 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry... Mommy...

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.530 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ushio. Let me know first

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.032 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you're going to
the bathroom, okay?

00:23:55.032 --> 00:23:56.931 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: What's wrong?
