00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:10.135 position:27% line:5% align:start
 Bit by bit, I collected
 pieces of junk

00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:13.270 position:50% line:5% align:start
 and bit by bit,
 she put them together.

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:21.707 position:27% line:5% align:start
  All the while, clouds
 began to fill the sky.

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:24.242 position:50% line:83% align:start
 I wanted to fly
 with these wings...

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:29.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
 to leave this place long behind
before the cold sets in.

00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:39.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
When winter comes,
she'll stop moving.

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:41.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what she
told me, at least.

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:46.818 position:16% line:5% align:start
 To be honest, I don't quite
 understand what she meant.

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:49.453 position:50% line:83% align:start
  All I know is
 that time is short

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:53.322 position:27% line:83% align:start
and we have do something
  before it's too late.

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:27.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [children laughing]

 [Kyou]:
 Bye-bye! Take care!

00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:33.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ryou]:
Good luck!

00:02:33.537 --> 00:02:36.304 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Kotomi]:
 I can't wait to
 see you all again.

00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:39.505 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sunohara]:
I won't forget you
after I'm famous!

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:41.873 position:5% line:83% align:start
Bye-bye!
Bye!

00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:47.142 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
 Congratulations on
 graduating, Tomoya.

00:02:51.078 --> 00:02:53.512 position:27% line:89% align:start
[waking groans]

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:09.252 position:72% line:83% align:start
 [sighs]
 Oh yeah...

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:14.556 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]:
I know I said
it before...

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:18.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
but congratulations on
graduating. We're proud of you.

00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now you're a real
member of society!

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:22.526 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  I guess. But I really
  just feel like a bum.

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:25.027 position:72% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]:
  Oh? What are your
plans right now?

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:27.095 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Uh, nothing in particular.

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:29.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio]:
You're pathetic.

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
How  bout you work here
at the bakery for a while?

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:34.331 position:72% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]:
That's a wonderful idea!

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
 If you help out in the
morning, then I can pack

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
  little lunchboxes for
  Nagisa to take to school!

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:41.101 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I've wanted to do that
 ever since she was little,

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:42.836 position:50% line:83% align:start
 but I never can
  make the time

00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:44.470 position:38% line:83% align:start
 with all the baking
 we need to do.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.671 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio]:
But I'll warn you,
you ain't getting paid much,

00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:48.372 position:5% line:83% align:start
so don't get your hopes
up or anything.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:50.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
  That sounds great;
  thank you.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Well, I'm glad; I look forward
to working with you, Tomoya.

00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:55.675 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, say again?

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:57.576 position:72% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]:
 You don't mind me using
your first name, do you?

00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:01.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
 We're practically family now...
 it only seems natural.

00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.112 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [bee buzzing]

00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:06.313 position:16% line:83% align:start
  That's great! Mom and dad
 could really use some help

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
making bread in the morning, and
if nothing else,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.448 position:50% line:83% align:start
it'll be an easy
commute for you!

00:04:10.548 --> 00:04:11.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a temporary
solution,

00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:13.550 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I can't keep relying
on them forever.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is off subject, but I'm
  feeling a lot better now that

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:19.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
the weather's warmed up.
I think I can even go to school!

00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:20.820 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Sure would be nice
if you could get into

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.154 position:5% line:83% align:start
the same class as
Tomoyo and Miyazawa.

00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:24.255 position:83% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:31.158 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 I begin work
at five in the morning.

00:04:33.526 --> 00:04:37.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
  By this time, the Old Man
 is already baking.

00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:41.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Sanae teaches me how
 to do this and that

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:44.998 position:16% line:83% align:start
 while she lines up
 the finished bread.

00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:53.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hi, Tomoya.

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:56.437 position:50% line:83% align:start
Oh! You going to
  the opening ceremony?

00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:57.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yep! See you later!

00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:59.505 position:50% line:83% align:start
 All right, take
 care out there.

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.038 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will!

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.041 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Good luck, Nagisa.
 Give it your best.

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:11.611 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  We're busiest from opening
 till about 9:00 AM.

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
  This is when most of the
 sales for the day are made.

00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:22.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
 By noon, the flow of customers
 pretty much dies down.

00:05:22.682 --> 00:05:25.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
 When things are quiet in the
 shop, Sanae holds classes

00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:27.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
 for the kids in the
 neighborhood.

00:05:27.318 --> 00:05:30.720 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is another way for the
Furukawas to support themselves.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, kid, I'm back.

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:33.889 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Where've you been?

00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:36.589 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? Uh here
and there... y'know.

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.524 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 The Old Man
 wanders out sometimes.

00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:43.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
 I have no idea where he goes
or what he does.

00:05:43.626 --> 00:05:44.926 position:50% line:89% align:start
It sure is slow.

00:05:45.026 --> 00:05:47.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, no kidding.

00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:50.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
 I hope Nagisa's doing all right
 at school. I'm worried.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.197 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, there ain't no point in
getting stressed out about it.

00:05:53.297 --> 00:05:55.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know... how  bout we play
catch with Sanae's bread?

00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:58.699 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 I dunno... we shouldn't
 waste food, right?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't be such
a wet blanket.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.568 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who says you can't have
a little fun at work?

00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:03.869 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Girl]:
Excuse me...

00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:05.336 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Oh! W-welcome-

00:06:05.437 --> 00:06:07.970 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Akio]:
 Oh... thought
 you were a customer.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to see you
at work, Tomoya;

00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:12.072 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your apron looks cute.
[cute giggle]

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.073 position:27% line:83% align:start
 So, you found out what
 class you're in, right?

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:16.542 position:5% line:5% align:start
Uh, yeah, but it's full
of people I've never met.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:19.109 position:5% line:5% align:start
I think it'll be okay, though;
they seem really nice

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.744 position:5% line:5% align:start
and I'm looking forward
to making some new friends.

00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:23.077 position:61% line:89% align:start
Sounds good.

00:06:23.178 --> 00:06:24.612 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Akio]:
All right!

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:26.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Forget about catch, now that
we've got enough people,

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:29.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
 let's have a snowball fight
 with Sanae's bread!

00:06:29.448 --> 00:06:30.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
Umm...

00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:32.883 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Mom's right behind you, Dad.

00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:34.349 position:72% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]:
 My bread...

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.517 position:50% line:5% align:start
  You're saying
 my bread...

00:06:36.617 --> 00:06:41.119 position:16% line:77% align:start
  [Sanae (fighting tears)]:
Is for...for hitting
people, is that it?!

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.488 position:38% line:83% align:start
 [Akio (mouthful):]
  No, I love your bread, Sanae!

00:06:44.588 --> 00:06:46.923 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  I began to realize
  that the old man and Sanae

00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:49.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
  weren't doing things like
that because they were crazy...

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
 they were doing them because

00:06:51.391 --> 00:06:54.025 position:16% line:83% align:start
 they wanted to see
 their daughter smile.

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:56.126 position:61% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tomoya.

00:06:56.227 --> 00:06:58.428 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I'm heading to school;
 see you later.

00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:01.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, hey; You have club
orientations today, don't you?

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.430 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Yeah. I wrote a script
and memorized it

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.131 position:61% line:83% align:start
so I'll know
  just what to say!

00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:07.332 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sounds good to me. I hope
everything works out!

00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:11.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa? Hey! You eat
breakfast this morning?

00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:15.336 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Nagisa]:
No, but it's too late,
I already brushed my teeth!

00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:31.543 position:72% line:89% align:start
 Nagisa!

00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:36.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh. Hi Tomoya. I didn't
notice you there.

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:39.714 position:27% line:83% align:start
How was orientation? Did
it go well? Everything okay?

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:44.115 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Yeah, everything is fine! The
 speech went over really well.

00:07:44.216 --> 00:07:45.884 position:61% line:89% align:start
  Nagisa...

00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:49.219 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 Come on, tell me the truth.
 It's all right.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.820 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
 I got really nervous
  at the orientation

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.588 position:16% line:89% align:start
and messed up my speech.

00:07:53.688 --> 00:07:57.790 position:16% line:83% align:start
 But Tomoyo and Miyazawa and
 Nishina still clapped for me...

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.089 position:27% line:89% align:start
  so it wasn't all bad.

00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:00.557 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you find an adviser
for the club?

00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:02.525 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Yeah, it's kind
 of a strange match,

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
but Mr. Minoshima from the track
 team is picking up the job.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
[uneasy groan]
That guy, huh?

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:09.695 position:38% line:83% align:start
  But we don't have
 any members right now,

00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:11.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
 so if we can't recruit
at least two more people

00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:13.864 position:38% line:83% align:start
 by next Wednesday,
 then the Drama Club

00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:15.464 position:27% line:89% align:start
will be disbanded again.

00:08:15.564 --> 00:08:17.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have to work extra hard to
 make sure that doesn't happen!

00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:19.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
 What about your class?
  How's that going?

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.434 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Are you making
any new friends?

00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:25.436 position:61% line:5% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 Do people know this is your
second year as a senior?

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:29.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, everyone knows.
That's why it's so tough.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.639 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think people want
to talk to me very much.

00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:34.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
  It'll be fine. You've got
 a likable personality;

00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:36.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
  I'm sure everyone'll love you
 once they get a chance

00:08:36.508 --> 00:08:38.742 position:50% line:83% align:start
  to know you a
 little better.

00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:41.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
I sure hope
that's true.

00:08:42.076 --> 00:08:44.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to give up
on the drama club.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.346 position:61% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  Yeah.

00:08:48.446 --> 00:08:49.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to sound
like I'm being negative;

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to talk to you
about fun things.

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:53.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to be able
to smile and tell you

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:57.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
what happened at school, or with
the drama club, or whatever!

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tomoya?

00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:02.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
 H-huh? Oh yeah, right; I'm sure
  we'll have a lot of fun stuff

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.187 position:50% line:89% align:start
 to talk about.

00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:05.588 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:20.395 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
Since then... Nagisa hasn't told
 me anything fun about school.

00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:22.630 position:5% line:89% align:start
  If I try to encourage her,

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I'm afraid it'll just
 put pressure on her.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:28.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I say  do your best , I might
  just be stressing her out.

00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:31.500 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the way
 I see it, at least.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
 But Nagisa was never late to
 school and never missed a day.

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:40.170 position:5% line:83% align:start
 With or without encouragement,
she always did her best.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
  But in the end...
 despite her best efforts...

00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:51.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
 not a single person
wanted to join her club.

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:10.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
Phew...

00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:13.020 position:50% line:89% align:start
  Hey, Yoshino!

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:14.220 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey. Look who it is.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.221 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Your job sure does
 look tough.

00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:18.889 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Yeah. We don't
have enough workers.

00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:20.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's pretty
stressful sometimes.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:23.591 position:61% line:89% align:start
 Oh yeah...

00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:25.026 position:61% line:83% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
 Congrats on graduating.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh... Thank you.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.527 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Anyway, whatcha
up to right now?

00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:32.029 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just running errands...
that sort of thing.

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:35.664 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Come and visit
us sometime.

00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:38.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
Evenings are best, since
  Kouko spends most the day

00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:39.499 position:50% line:89% align:start
at the hospital.

00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:41.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, Kouko's younger
sister's been hospitalized

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
for a long time,
hasn't she?

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:46.902 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
 Yeah. But Kouko
believes she'll recover.

00:10:47.002 --> 00:10:49.202 position:50% line:83% align:start
 So I won't give
up hope, either.

00:10:49.303 --> 00:10:50.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I'd better
get back to work.

00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:54.272 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Oh. I'm sorry.
 Catch you some other time.

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:08.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Even the ones far from the
station are expensive...

00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:11.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dude, really?
[laughs]

00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:22.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's funny, I was
growing my hair out, too!

00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:24.286 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Kyou]:
Tomoya!

00:11:25.454 --> 00:11:28.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi Okazaki, haven't
seen you in a while!

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Yeah, what's up? You on
 your way home from school?

00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:33.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:35.458 position:38% line:83% align:start
  I haven't see you
  since graduation;

00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:37.125 position:50% line:83% align:start
 is Nagisa doing
 better now?

00:11:37.225 --> 00:11:39.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, she's fine; she
goes to school every day.

00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:40.861 position:27% line:5% align:start
 Good to hear!

00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:42.729 position:27% line:83% align:start
  It's not like we live
  far away or anything;

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:44.530 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd like to see you guys
 every once in a while.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.430 position:16% line:83% align:start
  We just haven't been able
  to make the time.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Maybe we can put together
 some kind of reunion

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:50.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
 after our schedules
 clear up a little bit.

00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:52.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't know school would
keep you so busy all the time.

00:11:52.968 --> 00:11:56.401 position:16% line:83% align:start
  And what about you? Still
 freeloading off the Furukawas?

00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.936 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Come on, sis, you don't
 have to be so rude.

00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:00.770 position:27% line:5% align:start
  No, you have a point.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.771 position:5% line:5% align:start
  Don't worry, I'm not planning
on freeloading off them forever.

00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:05.073 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm not used to you agreeing
 with me like that;

00:12:05.172 --> 00:12:06.773 position:16% line:89% align:start
 It's kinda weirding me out.

00:12:06.873 --> 00:12:08.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
  C'mon! Don't look so down!

00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you can make it on your
 own if you put your mind to it!

00:12:11.442 --> 00:12:13.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, actually, I was
looking for a cheap apartment

00:12:13.876 --> 00:12:15.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
before I ran
into you two.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.845 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Didn't have
much luck, though.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:20.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Oh, um, that reminds me, my
 friend said her older brother

00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:23.015 position:16% line:83% align:start
 is going to move out
 of his apartment soon!

00:12:23.114 --> 00:12:24.716 position:50% line:83% align:start
I-I mean, it's
an old building,

00:12:24.816 --> 00:12:27.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
  but you said you were looking
 for someplace cheap, so...

00:12:27.717 --> 00:12:31.919 position:38% line:83% align:start
Sorry! I didn't mean
 to butt in or anything.

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:35.152 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]:
No, that's great!
Please... tell me more!

  [Tomoya]:
Yoshino!

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.625 position:61% line:83% align:start
 Hold on...
  [panting]

00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:49.893 position:61% line:89% align:start
 Yoshino...

00:12:49.994 --> 00:12:50.995 position:38% line:5% align:start
  [catching breath]
You think...

00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:53.062 position:27% line:5% align:start
 You think you could...

00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:55.262 position:50% line:5% align:start
  Could you get
  me a job, please?

00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:57.464 position:50% line:89% align:start
 I'll work hard!

00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:04.400 position:72% line:83% align:start
  Akio:
 I see. Moving out, huh?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.134 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]:
If you're sure
that's what you want...

00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:07.836 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 Well, I'm an adult.

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:10.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
 I don't want to be a burden
 on you guys anymore.

00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:11.704 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio]:
You got enough money?

00:13:11.804 --> 00:13:13.872 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  I've got a little
  stashed away.

00:13:13.972 --> 00:13:15.673 position:16% line:83% align:start
I haven't touched most of my
 pay, so it should be all right.

00:13:15.773 --> 00:13:18.340 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio]:
Fair enough. Well,
I've said all I can say.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can do
whatever you want.

00:13:21.642 --> 00:13:25.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
  You took good care of me.
Thanks for everything!

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.816 position:38% line:5% align:start
 You sure the shop's
 gonna be all right?

00:13:38.182 --> 00:13:39.784 position:50% line:5% align:start
Yeah, I wouldn't
 worry about it.

00:13:39.884 --> 00:13:42.885 position:27% line:5% align:start
 No one's gonna come in
at this time of day.

00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:46.087 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio]:
And show some gratitude.
I could see it in your eyes...

00:13:46.186 --> 00:13:47.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
You wanted to play
catch with me so bad

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:49.689 position:5% line:83% align:start
you were about
to piss your pants.

00:13:49.789 --> 00:13:51.188 position:61% line:89% align:start
 [chuckling]

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:52.690 position:27% line:83% align:start
  You just keep telling
 yourself that, old man;

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.924 position:50% line:83% align:start
 whatever helps
 you sleep at night!

00:13:55.025 --> 00:13:56.092 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Listen, kid...

00:13:56.191 --> 00:13:57.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
What is it?

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Come to me if you have any
 problems, all right?

00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
Being an adult
isn't always easy,

00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:04.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
so if you need
a little help sometime,

00:14:04.996 --> 00:14:07.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
don't be afraid
to give me a call.

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:09.197 position:50% line:83% align:start
I appreciate it;
 it really means a lot to me

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:11.232 position:27% line:89% align:start
  to hear you say that.

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:17.602 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess you're not so
immature after all.

00:14:19.403 --> 00:14:20.536 position:38% line:89% align:start
 I have a question.

00:14:20.636 --> 00:14:21.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:24.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
  Would you let me take
Nagisa with me some day?

00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:45.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's up to her; not me.

00:14:45.448 --> 00:14:48.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's old enough to make
her own decisions now.

00:14:55.153 --> 00:14:59.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right... gimme
your best pitch, kid.

00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:01.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll show you why everyone
in the neighborhood

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
calls me the
bread-baking Babe Ruth!

00:15:06.525 --> 00:15:08.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, nice pitch!

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:10.593 position:83% line:89% align:start
 Ah!

00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:15.163 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [glass shattering]

00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:16.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:15:16.563 --> 00:15:18.164 position:38% line:89% align:start
  You did it again!

00:15:18.263 --> 00:15:20.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
You! Go apologize! I gotta
get back to work, dude!

00:15:20.932 --> 00:15:23.900 position:61% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  What?! You suck, old man!

00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:31.737 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya (straining)]:
 Careful, careful...

00:15:31.837 --> 00:15:33.303 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Wow...

00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:36.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
  Pretty small, huh?
Pretty old, too.

00:15:36.806 --> 00:15:38.707 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 You looking for
 rats in there?

00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:41.909 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no! I was just thinking
that it looked really nice!

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:45.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well... if nothing else,
 it's well ventilated, I guess.

00:16:01.217 --> 00:16:03.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not great,
but it's an improvement.

 Now that that's taken care of,

00:16:05.386 --> 00:16:07.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna return
the truck and head home.

00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:09.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you for the furniture
and silverware, papa;

00:16:09.455 --> 00:16:11.022 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're ever
so kind.

00:16:11.122 --> 00:16:13.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
 No problem, princess; Not like
  we were using them anyway.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.224 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, Nagisa... have fun,
 but don't stay out too late.

00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:18.425 position:61% line:83% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
Yes sir!

00:16:18.525 --> 00:16:19.625 position:72% line:5% align:start
 [Akio]:
 See you later.

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:22.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Thanks for all your help.

00:16:23.694 --> 00:16:25.528 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [awkwardly clears throat]

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tomoya?

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.765 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [nervous laughter]

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:33.899 position:5% line:5% align:start
Uh...I think I'm going
to make us some tea.

00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:37.501 position:5% line:5% align:start
You just sit here and relax
in the meantime, okay?

00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:42.603 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Dango, dango, dango, dango...

00:16:42.703 --> 00:16:45.805 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
 Dango, dango family.

00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:48.040 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder if we'll live
together like this someday.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
That'd be nice.

00:16:49.473 --> 00:16:50.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
 What was that, again?;
I couldn't hear you.

00:16:50.607 --> 00:16:52.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's nothing!;
Nevermind!

00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:57.410 position:61% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  See you tomorrow.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Yeah. Umm...

00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:00.645 position:5% line:5% align:start
Hm?

00:17:00.746 --> 00:17:02.646 position:50% line:83% align:start
 I know you two
don't talk much,

00:17:02.747 --> 00:17:05.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
 but did you tell your dad that
 you were moving to a new place?

00:17:05.148 --> 00:17:07.615 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I think you should at least
 let him know where you live...

00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:10.449 position:50% line:83% align:start
 just... in case
 something happens.

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:14.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, guess you're right. I'll
try to give him a call later.

00:17:14.384 --> 00:17:18.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Great! First night in your new
  place. I hope you sleep well!

00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:20.387 position:5% line:5% align:start
Yeah. I'll try.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:35.595 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  And thus, I began
  living on my own.

00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:39.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
  I'm an adult now, I can't
 rely on anyone else anymore.

00:17:42.232 --> 00:17:46.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
 It was my first night alone.
  I didn't sleep too well...

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:53.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
Tomoya, wake up! Hey! Tomoya...!

00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:58.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Your new job starts today,
 remember? You're gonna be late!

00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:09.310 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tastes great!

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.845 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
 If you like, I can stop by
  and make dinner for you, too.

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:13.813 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Hmm... I don't know
when I'll be back.

00:18:13.913 --> 00:18:16.848 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
  That's all right.
 I'll just wait for you!

00:18:20.884 --> 00:18:22.283 position:16% line:89% align:start
 "That's all right..."

00:18:22.383 --> 00:18:24.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll just wait for you.

00:18:24.818 --> 00:18:26.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
[flustered chuckle]

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.893 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [deep breath]

00:18:40.692 --> 00:18:42.593 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Good morning, everyone!

00:18:45.128 --> 00:18:45.961 position:72% line:89% align:start
Morning.

00:18:46.061 --> 00:18:47.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, uhm... I was just...

00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:51.864 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
 You showed up. Go ahead
  and change into this.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.732 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Morning, you two.

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yoshino, is this the kid you
 said is gonna be working here?

00:18:56.299 --> 00:18:57.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
  That's right, sir.

00:18:57.767 --> 00:18:59.902 position:16% line:83% align:start
  This is our boss.
 Introduce yourself.

00:19:00.002 --> 00:19:01.236 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm Tomoya Okazaki.

00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:03.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
I look forward to
working with you, sir.

00:19:03.303 --> 00:19:06.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
  I'll warn you, your first
 few days might be a bit rough,

00:19:06.337 --> 00:19:07.906 position:38% line:83% align:start
 but you'll get used
to it after a while.

00:19:08.006 --> 00:19:09.840 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just make sure you don't
hurt yourself out there.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes sir, I'll try not
to let you down.

00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:15.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really have changed,
haven't you?

00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:17.010 position:61% line:89% align:start
 I'm sorry?

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not a bad thing;

00:19:18.644 --> 00:19:20.411 position:5% line:83% align:start
you just seem a little different
from when I first met you.

00:19:20.511 --> 00:19:22.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
But that only makes sense;
you were just a kid, after all.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
  Ha! So does that mean
  I look like an adult now?

00:19:24.814 --> 00:19:27.248 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]:
No. You look like a kid
who's trying really hard

00:19:27.347 --> 00:19:29.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
to look like an adult.

00:19:29.315 --> 00:19:32.017 position:61% line:83% align:start
So I'm still
a just kid, huh?

00:19:32.117 --> 00:19:33.450 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you're serious now.

00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:35.052 position:50% line:83% align:start
  And what does
 that mean?

00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:38.753 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Means you're learning
to be an adult.

00:19:38.853 --> 00:19:41.855 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Anyway, do me a favor and try
 not to quit on the first day.

00:19:41.955 --> 00:19:44.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I get depressed,
it won't be pretty.

00:19:44.156 --> 00:19:45.590 position:5% line:89% align:start
  You think I'm gonna quit?

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.457 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Not when I have an
 apartment to pay for! Heh.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:59.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
 First, grab the ladder and put
 it against the telephone pole.

00:19:59.163 --> 00:20:01.031 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Okay!

00:20:01.131 --> 00:20:03.232 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
 And put your helmet on straight
while you're at it. You hear me?

00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:04.933 position:16% line:89% align:start
Eh... heh, heh. Yessir!

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:08.201 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
Try not to use your arms
  to support your body.

00:20:08.301 --> 00:20:11.569 position:16% line:5% align:start
 Put most your weight on the
 rope. Trust me. It's safer.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
Th-That's easy
to say, but...

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.637 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Just do it. If you waste
all your energy

00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:18.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
hugging the pole,
you won't last.

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:21.674 position:5% line:5% align:start
Tighten the bolts in a diagonal
order. That's basic.

00:20:21.774 --> 00:20:23.540 position:5% line:5% align:start
Be sure to check everything
once you're finished.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.842 position:5% line:5% align:start
You got all that?
  Y-Yessir!

00:20:25.943 --> 00:20:27.876 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Yoshino]:
All right, good.
Then tighten these bolts.

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:28.877 position:72% line:89% align:start
  Okay.

00:20:31.344 --> 00:20:33.079 position:83% line:89% align:start
 Ah!

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:34.346 position:27% line:89% align:start
 What's wrong with you?!

00:20:34.446 --> 00:20:35.780 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.647 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can't afford to make
  mistakes on this job!

00:20:37.747 --> 00:20:40.716 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Think... what if someone
was down there?

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:44.151 position:5% line:83% align:start
What if someone you loved
was down there? Then what?

00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:46.484 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
 That's why you gotta follow
 the rules at all times.

00:20:46.585 --> 00:20:49.321 position:61% line:83% align:start
 Be careful.
  Very careful.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.120 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes sir.

00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:53.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya groaning]

00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:54.488 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Tired already?

00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:56.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, my whole body's
aching like crazy.

00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:59.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
Always thought I had
better stamina than this.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.558 position:61% line:83% align:start
 You'll get
 used to it.

00:21:00.658 --> 00:21:02.726 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Let's go ahead
  to the next site.

00:21:04.094 --> 00:21:05.261 position:83% line:89% align:start
Heh.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.962 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]:
How many more do
we have left?

00:21:07.062 --> 00:21:09.729 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Yoshino]:
 We have four more jobs
 just like this one.

00:21:10.864 --> 00:21:12.898 position:5% line:89% align:start
 I'm leaving; see you tomorrow.

00:21:12.998 --> 00:21:15.632 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Bye. Good work today!

00:21:17.933 --> 00:21:19.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Ouch... Ugh...

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:26.437 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I'm home...

00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:30.139 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, Tomoya!
You really startled me.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.539 position:72% line:89% align:start
Sorry...

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.175 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Are you okay? You're
not hurt, are you?

00:21:34.275 --> 00:21:35.741 position:38% line:89% align:start
 No...

00:21:37.775 --> 00:21:40.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
Something really good happened
to me at school today!

00:21:40.477 --> 00:21:42.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
It turns out that
Nishina's in the same

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:44.579 position:38% line:83% align:start
 music appreciation
class as me!

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:45.746 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't seen her in
a while, but Nishina said

00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:49.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
she was worried
about me.

00:21:49.514 --> 00:21:52.149 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I see... That's good.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, you look
really tired.

00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:58.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe you should lay down
and get some rest.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:02.854 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
  No, no, I wanna hear about
what happened. Go on...

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:05.089 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Okay... I guess...

00:23:42.467 --> 00:23:44.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 Good morning.

00:23:46.237 --> 00:23:48.437 position:38% line:83% align:start
 You're not holding
 the spanner the right way.

00:23:48.537 --> 00:23:50.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
  I showed you how to do it
yesterday, remember?

00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:51.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry!

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.941 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Right! Sorry!

00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.375 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Did you check
the junctions?

00:23:57.474 --> 00:23:58.776 position:5% line:89% align:start
I-I'm Sorry...

00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:01.411 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why are you apologizing?
 You didn't do anything.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.844 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Oh, sorry, I can't.

00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:05.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I have a mock entrance
 exam that afternoon.

00:24:05.712 --> 00:24:07.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
 I'm sorry. I hate to say that

00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:10.048 position:16% line:83% align:start
 when we don't spend
 enough time together as-is.
