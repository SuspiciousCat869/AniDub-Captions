 -[Saki] Shima.
 -[gasp]

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:14.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Saki... Hey, Yuki...

00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:16.652 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Misae didn't come
to school today.

00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:19.654 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, she called Saki this
morning and said she had a cold.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.022 position:5% line:89% align:start
We thought you knew.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope you weren't waiting
out here too long.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.791 position:50% line:89% align:start
No, it's okay...

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
So something did
happen, after all.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not like Misae to skip
school, even if she is sick.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
Probably something with
Igarashi, right?

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:38.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Saki] I see...
So, he turned her down.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuki sighs] Poor Misae...

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
  -But you know what, Shima?
  -Hm?

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:45.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
As much as I hate to see Misae
get her heart broken,

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:48.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think a guy like you suits her
a lot better than Igarashi.

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:52.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you could just talk to her,
I bet she would cheer up.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.179 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll get her to come
to the park later.

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:55.879 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.617 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.627 position:27% line:83% align:start
  -Sagara...
  -[gasp]

00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:55.730 position:50% line:83% align:start
Shima, what are
you doing here?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, Sagara, I...
I mean, Misae, I, uh...

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.436 position:61% line:89% align:start
 What is it?

00:03:03.536 --> 00:03:06.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
Love is like the fireworks
of days long past,

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:07.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
don't you think?

00:03:07.472 --> 00:03:08.739 position:38% line:89% align:start
  What do you mean?

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
Boom! You can't appreciate
its true beauty

00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:12.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
until it bursts.

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Are you picking
 a fight with me, or what?!

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:16.545 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry, sorry!

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:18.412 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:03:18.512 --> 00:03:21.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um... here...
you can use this.

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.249 position:50% line:83% align:start
Use it for what?
I'm not crying.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.118 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh... Then use it when you
run out of toilet paper.

00:03:26.218 --> 00:03:30.321 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to be nice or are
you just trying to piss me off?!

00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:33.622 position:38% line:83% align:start
Why are you being
so weird, huh?

00:03:33.722 --> 00:03:36.525 position:38% line:83% align:start
I bet Yuki and Saki
put you up to this.

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:38.860 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, could you tell?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not the type to use
cheesy pickup lines like that.

00:03:42.662 --> 00:03:44.197 position:38% line:83% align:start
Why don't you try
saying something

00:03:44.297 --> 00:03:46.099 position:27% line:89% align:start
 from the heart instead?

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:49.867 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, let's see...

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:52.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:56.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Why are you apologizing
 this time?

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because...

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
because I think it's probably
my fault that you're sad,

00:04:00.442 --> 00:04:01.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
at least on some level.

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.211 position:38% line:83% align:start
What's that supposed
to mean?

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.912 position:27% line:83% align:start
What makes you think you
did something wrong?

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.746 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Wait, I take that back.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.549 position:27% line:83% align:start
 You've done pretty much
 everything wrong...

00:04:10.648 --> 00:04:12.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm really sorry!

00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:16.286 position:27% line:83% align:start
Anyway, it's not all the
stupid stuff you've done

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:17.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
  that I'm depressed about.

00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:20.622 position:27% line:83% align:start
 This really has nothing
 to do with you.

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:22.157 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:25.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait, don't tell me you're
thinking this is your big chance

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:27.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
to make me fall
in love with you.

00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:29.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like we were talking about
yesterday, I mean.

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:33.365 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's not fair, Misae. I wasn't
thinking about that at all.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, you're right.

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:40.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just came here to do me
a favor, like you said before.

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:42.404 position:38% line:83% align:start
You're not in love
with me or anything,

00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:44.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
 you're just doing what you
 think is right, aren't you?

00:04:44.772 --> 00:04:47.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
  -That's not true, either!
  -Huh?

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.644 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, okay then...

00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:56.680 position:27% line:83% align:start
So I guess... you are in
love with me, after all?

00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:59.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess...

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:02.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well... that settles it.

00:05:08.755 --> 00:05:13.025 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way,
what do you like about me?

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.060 position:38% line:83% align:start
Even if you scold me
all the time...

00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I know it's only
 because you care about me.

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
  Oh, and when you do those
  wrestling moves on me...

00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:22.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
  you smell really nice
  and sweet.

00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:24.600 position:61% line:89% align:start
I like that.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I could've done
without that last part.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.437 position:61% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't need to apologize.

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:34.908 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Shima sighs]

00:05:36.008 --> 00:05:37.075 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:39.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:44.047 position:50% line:83% align:start
You're welcome.
My pleasure...

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:48.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Saki]
Misae!

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:51.019 position:5% line:89% align:start
 [laughs] Hey, you free today?

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:53.655 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard there's a new ice cream
parlor across from the station.

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
You wanna go
check it out with us?

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry! I can't go today.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.559 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look. He's been waiting
out there all day.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd feel bad if I left him
hanging

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:03.327 position:5% line:89% align:start
and went off with you guys.

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:04.727 position:5% line:89% align:start
See ya.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:07.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
It looks like those two
are getting along.

00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:10.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
She sure perked up,
that's for sure.

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:12.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shima]
Student council president?

00:06:12.334 --> 00:06:15.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. I know it doesn't
seem like it, but that's me.

00:06:15.102 --> 00:06:17.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
 And the first female president
 at the school, too.

00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.772 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, Misae, that's amazing!

00:06:19.872 --> 00:06:22.040 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Autumn Festival's right
around the corner.

00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:23.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have to help out
at the school,

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:25.476 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I'm afraid I'm a
little busy right now.

00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:28.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I wish we could spend
a bit more time together.

00:06:28.512 --> 00:06:29.779 position:5% line:89% align:start
Autumn Festival?

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.113 position:50% line:89% align:start
  By the way...

00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:33.748 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was thinking,
if you weren't too busy,

00:06:33.848 --> 00:06:36.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
maybe you and I could
check it out together.

00:06:36.283 --> 00:06:37.985 position:50% line:89% align:start
Like a date?

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:43.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Shima] Hey, guys, I don't think
she's gonna fall for this.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.690 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [student] She's cute!

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Saki] Don't worry!
You look great!

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:50.327 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Shima] I see.
Misae's busy today, huh?

00:06:50.427 --> 00:06:53.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep. She's got another
student council meeting.

00:06:53.395 --> 00:06:56.331 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, she told us to tell you
that she was going to be late.

00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:57.932 position:61% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:06:58.032 --> 00:07:01.602 position:5% line:83% align:start

I bet she's really cool.

 What class are you in?

Haven't seen you here.

thanks. Actually, she's with us.

00:08:01.943 --> 00:08:03.911 position:5% line:83% align:start
But maybe they should apply for
a club permit.

[Shima] <i>She's so cool...</i>

00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:09.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have some business
with the student council?

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:11.883 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no need to be so shy,
you can go inside if you like.

00:08:11.983 --> 00:08:14.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no rule against it;
they're just having a meeting.

00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:17.154 position:5% line:89% align:start
Um, yeah, but I, uh, well...

00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:18.722 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -So I think-
 -Excuse me, Sagara...

00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:21.591 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Oh, Miss Ibuki...

00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:25.226 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for interrupting.
This girl wants to talk to you.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.194 position:16% line:89% align:start
Go on, speak up...

00:08:27.295 --> 00:08:28.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:31.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh my gosh, you're so cute!

00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:33.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry if I kept you
waiting too long.

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:36.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, it's fine. Th-thank you.

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:39.136 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, what did you
want to talk about?

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:41.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't hold back,
you can say anything.

00:08:41.672 --> 00:08:42.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's the student council's job

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
to listen to whatever the
students have to say.

00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:48.175 position:38% line:89% align:start
I, uh...

00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:49.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.211 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I'll just say it then.

00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:53.246 position:16% line:89% align:start
Misae, I...

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:55.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you...

00:08:55.814 --> 00:08:57.915 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right by your side.

00:08:59.317 --> 00:09:03.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry... What kind of
relationship do you two have?

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.754 position:27% line:89% align:start
[awkward laugh]

00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:07.056 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I think I'd better go!

00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:12.559 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [laughing]

00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:17.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Wow, that was the funniest
 thing I've ever seen.

00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:18.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not funny at all!

00:09:18.897 --> 00:09:21.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder if she knew
it was me or not.

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:23.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's all right, don't worry!

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.134 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Yuki] But that
made me wonder...

00:09:25.234 --> 00:09:27.036 position:16% line:83% align:start
do you think Misae
likes you better that way?

00:09:27.136 --> 00:09:29.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope that's supposed
to be a joke!

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:34.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right.

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:36.576 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'd forgotten...

00:09:38.977 --> 00:09:41.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
 [Saki] Hey, Shima,
 are you busy right now?

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:42.847 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:42.947 --> 00:09:45.349 position:16% line:83% align:start
Saki and I were cooking up
a little plan, that's all.

00:09:45.449 --> 00:09:48.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're not busy, could we
go over to your house, please?

00:09:48.384 --> 00:09:50.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:53.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
 [Saki] I see. Misae hasn't
 been to your house yet?

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:54.988 position:27% line:89% align:start
 That's funny!

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuki] Wow, you know,

00:09:57.591 --> 00:09:59.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was gonna brag about going
over to Shima's house

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:00.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
while she was at school,

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
but this is even better!

00:10:02.327 --> 00:10:03.562 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [laughing]

00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:05.863 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Shima sighs]

00:10:08.064 --> 00:10:11.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is something wrong?
We don't have to tell Misae...

00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:14.570 position:27% line:89% align:start
No... That's not that.

00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:20.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
For some reason I can't remember
where my house is.

00:10:23.142 --> 00:10:25.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Saki] Hey, come on...
it's right over here!

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't joke around like that,
it's not funny! Jeez!

00:10:32.115 --> 00:10:34.916 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, hello, may I help you?

00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:36.451 position:72% line:89% align:start
 Hello!

00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:40.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, what's wrong?
Stop spacing out and say hello!

00:10:41.321 --> 00:10:44.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see.
Are you Katsuki's friends?

00:10:44.323 --> 00:10:45.424 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am!

00:10:45.524 --> 00:10:46.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
I didn't know.

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you for coming
all this way.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make yourselves at home.

00:10:51.228 --> 00:10:54.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can offer him some incense
at the altar, if you like.

Yeah, is there anything
we can do for you?

Hey, At the very least,
remember this.

00:11:41.196 --> 00:11:44.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
We believe you. We know you

  Oh no... it's gone...

00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:31.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe there wasn't anything
in there to begin with.

00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:34.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe that means I don't
need a wish after all,

it's just, you know...

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:58.918 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, what can you say, like it
or not, that's my life, right?

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm. Of course.

00:17:02.553 --> 00:17:06.790 position:5% line:83% align:start

We'll invite Yuki, too. Bye.

of getting rid of you
at this point.

It's getting late, Tomoya.
We should get going.

Ah, yeah...

[Misae] No, it's fine.

Just make sure you two go to
the Autumn Festival,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.530 position:50% line:89% align:start
like I said.

00:18:04.631 --> 00:18:05.597 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Okay!

00:18:05.698 --> 00:18:08.167 position:5% line:83% align:start

Misae something for you, right?

00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:28.880 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Earth to Tomoya...

00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.482 position:38% line:83% align:start
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

00:18:30.582 --> 00:18:32.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
It seems like you've had
something on your mind

00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:33.684 position:38% line:89% align:start
  since last night.

00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:36.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. There's something
I need to tell Misae,

00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I don't quite know how.

00:18:37.987 --> 00:18:39.354 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh?

So what's the deal?

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you have
something else you wanna say.

And her boyfriend!

00:18:55.666 --> 00:18:57.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, Misae!
Glad you could make it!

00:18:58.068 --> 00:18:59.602 position:38% line:83% align:start
Ah, thank goodness
you caught him!

00:18:59.702 --> 00:19:01.938 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Oh! I'm out of breath!
-I have a name, you know.

00:19:02.038 --> 00:19:04.106 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't have to call me
"Furukawa's boyfriend."

00:19:04.206 --> 00:19:06.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to admit, Misae,
it's pretty strange

00:19:06.373 --> 00:19:08.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
bringing your cat
to a festival.

00:19:08.142 --> 00:19:09.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
You got it all wrong.

00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:12.377 position:5% line:83% align:start
He ran out of the dorm all of
a sudden and wouldn't stop.

00:19:12.478 --> 00:19:15.013 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had to chase him all
the way to the festival.

00:19:15.114 --> 00:19:16.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Honestly, what was he thinking?

  [meowing]

00:19:21.617 --> 00:19:23.819 position:27% line:83% align:start

  [meowing]

00:19:27.088 --> 00:19:30.124 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
Get out of there!

00:19:30.224 --> 00:19:31.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Come on!
-[Tomoya] I'm not surprised.

00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:33.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
-We're going home!
-He probably wanted to come

00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:36.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
to this festival with you
for a long time.

00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:40.197 position:27% line:83% align:start
Last night, when I fell
asleep at your place,

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:42.799 position:16% line:89% align:start
I heard him speaking to me.

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:44.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
He said he was sorry.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
He wanted to stay with you
until the end of the festival.

00:19:51.371 --> 00:19:55.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did he...
Did he say anything else?

00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:59.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. He also said he'd stay
by your side and love you,

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.311 position:27% line:89% align:start
  just like you wished.

00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:08.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't remember saying I'd take
a cat on a date.

00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:12.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've been so bad...
running me around.

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:16.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
But... for once...
Let's just have fun.

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:20.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
Also, Misae,
there's one more thing he said.

00:20:21.093 --> 00:20:22.227 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:23.527 position:27% line:89% align:start
He said, no matter what,

00:20:23.627 --> 00:20:25.562 position:16% line:89% align:start
  he wants you to be happy.

00:20:26.663 --> 00:20:29.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
Go figure.
That's the kind of guy he is.

00:20:29.965 --> 00:20:31.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
All this time...

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:34.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
he's been worried
about you, Misae.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.805 position:16% line:89% align:start
Worried? I see.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.405 position:16% line:89% align:start
I guess you're right.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:42.741 position:16% line:89% align:start
He is that kind of guy.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.475 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [chuckle]

00:20:44.575 --> 00:20:46.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were right,
I'm not old yet.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
I should enjoy my youth.

00:20:51.446 --> 00:20:53.115 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Tomoya, I don't get it.

00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:55.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.
It was just a dream.

00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:58.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you'd like
to hear about it, though.

00:20:58.186 --> 00:21:00.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a little bittersweet...

00:21:00.287 --> 00:21:02.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I think it's a
wonderful love story.
