00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:07.086 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm Sanako Isogai.
Seventeen years old.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:08.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Youhei chuckles]

00:00:08.553 --> 00:00:12.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your big brother has taken
very good care of me.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
Funny, I feel like we've
met somewhere before.

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:16.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Sanae]
  This is a small town.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:19.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
We probably just bumped into
each other somewhere or another.

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:23.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
-You're awful pretty...
-That very sweet of you to say.

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:25.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:27.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
A pretty girl like you
with my brother...

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:28.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
With my brother...

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
With my brother...

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:33.640 position:5% line:83% align:start
-You poor thing!
-What's that supposed to mean?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like Mei doesn't
recognize her.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.911 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't believe the plan's
actually working!

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is it really that
hard to believe?

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Hey, it's a ghost.
-[Nagisa] For a second,

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:43.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't know it
was Mom, either.

00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:16.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] I really do feel like
I've met her somewhere before.

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:18.291 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's all in your head.

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:19.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I forgot to ask,

00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:21.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
but do you know where Sunohara's
taking her?

00:02:21.527 --> 00:02:23.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're probably just
going out to eat, first.

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:26.698 position:5% line:83% align:start
Speaking of which, I wonder if
he knows any nice restaurants.

00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:28.566 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey, Nagisa.

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:30.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you know what
used to be here before?

00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:33.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know... Sorry,
but I really can't remember...

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:36.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sana... Sanako, you're not,
uh, hungry, are you?

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:37.974 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Maybe a little bit.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's a place right around
the corner I always eat at.

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you say
we pick up lunch there?

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:45.346 position:27% line:83% align:start
That sounds great.
I can't wait to see!

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:47.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is my favorite place
in the whole town!

00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:49.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
  [disgusted groan]

00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:51.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] It's a really
nice restaurant.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:52.652 position:27% line:89% align:start
 You're kidding, right?

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:55.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the record,
I recommend the katsudon.

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:56.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
I eat it, like,
three times a day.

00:02:57.023 --> 00:02:59.558 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, I know the place may
look a little high-class,

00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
but don't worry, it's not
outside of my price range.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.528 position:61% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:05.029 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you really eat at this place

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
three times a day?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.497 position:5% line:89% align:start
And always katsudon?

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:10.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know it sounds expensive,
but I can handle it!

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:13.736 position:27% line:89% align:start
[goofy chuckle]

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:14.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.209 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here you go! Lunch is ready!

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:22.609 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei cheers]

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
[all] All right, let's eat!

00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:26.613 position:5% line:89% align:start
[all] Thanks for the food!

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:29.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, that was super delicious!

00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:32.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
But somehow the flavor seemed
strangely familiar...

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:34.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
Eating nothing but katsudon
everyday

00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:35.821 position:5% line:89% align:start
will leave you malnourished.

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:38.023 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should start cooking on your
own every once in a while.

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:39.291 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Youhei] Okay!

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanako, you're so sweet
and considerate.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.428 position:5% line:83% align:start
And yet... even though you're so
nice and pretty...

00:03:45.528 --> 00:03:47.530 position:5% line:89% align:start
My brother is...

00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:49.431 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, You poor thing!

00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:51.033 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can you stop saying
that already?

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:52.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
[both laugh]

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:55.903 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [both laugh]

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:58.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
They seem happy, but
what are they doing next?

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:01.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, probably going shopping
or to the movies or whatever.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.475 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, someplace normal, right?

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
He wouldn't take a nice
girl like her

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:06.412 position:5% line:89% align:start
to someplace like an arcade.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:07.813 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Mei groans]

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:12.016 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei, chanting]
Seiya, seiya, seiya, seiya!

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:14.451 position:27% line:83% align:start
-This is just awful.
-No joke.

00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:17.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
On the upside,
Sunohara looks really focused.

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:19.857 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Seiya!

00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:21.924 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hi-yah!

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.428 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Huh?!

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:27.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's with this machine?

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.396 position:5% line:83% align:start
The settings must be
all messed up.

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:32.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Violence isn't
the answer, Youhei!

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:33.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's get outta this sorry
place.

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:36.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's something you gotta
hear at the CD shop!

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:38.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
How is his taste in music?

00:04:39.272 --> 00:04:40.974 position:50% line:89% align:start
Bad. Really bad.

00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:42.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here we go, I found it!

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:45.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
These guys are
my favorite group!

00:04:46.178 --> 00:04:48.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, they look very unique!

00:04:48.145 --> 00:04:49.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:50.848 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Here, listen.

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:52.216 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [gasp]

00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:55.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's even more hopeless
than usual today.

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] It's starting
to get dark...

00:04:57.686 --> 00:04:59.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do you mean?
The night's still young!

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:01.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's find a place to watch
the sun set together!

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:05.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hasn't he dragged her
around town enough today?

00:05:05.727 --> 00:05:09.096 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't Sanae be getting back
to her real lover sometime soon?

00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:10.631 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, now that you mention it,

00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:12.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
she should probably start on
dinner...

00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:14.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[girl] No!
-[boy 1] You're in the way!

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
[boy 2] We can't play
with you here!

00:05:16.168 --> 00:05:18.237 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[girl] I don't wanna move!
-[boy 1] I don't care! Go away!

00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:19.504 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Get off of the swing!

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:21.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
No! Leave me alone!

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Is that bothering you?
-Yeah.

00:05:23.841 --> 00:05:25.309 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, let's go stop them!

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hold on a sec.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on, I'll go
say something to them...

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, they'll be fine!

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:32.614 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I...

00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:34.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
[children continue arguing]

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:35.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei]
Come on, it's no big deal.

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:38.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kids fight all the time,
it's how they grow up.

00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:40.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't mean that...

00:05:40.488 --> 00:05:42.290 position:5% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.890 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hey!

00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:46.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
[brother]
Leave my sister alone!

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.397 position:27% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:52.664 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [panting]

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.301 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [gasp]

00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:58.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
At any rate, it looks like the
problem took care of itself.

00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:00.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
No point in hanging around now.

00:06:00.437 --> 00:06:01.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait a second.

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:02.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
Doesn't it seem like something's

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:04.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
still bothering them?

00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me go check.
I'll be right back.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good thing I asked.

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:14.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
These two were running
an errand for their parents

00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:17.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
and couldn't find
their way back home.

00:06:17.184 --> 00:06:19.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
Her brother was trying to figure
out where they were

00:06:19.752 --> 00:06:23.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
when those boys walked up
and started picking on her.

00:06:23.156 --> 00:06:24.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see, so they're lost.

00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:26.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
While we're here, I think
we should make sure

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:28.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
they make it
back safe and sound.

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:31.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's no big deal.
They'll be fine on their own.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:32.563 position:61% line:89% align:start
 Cut it out!

00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:34.564 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Come on, you two.

00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:36.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Um, uh...

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:39.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
maybe we should find out
their names first.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]
Oh, alright.

00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:41.470 position:16% line:89% align:start
[little sister giggles]

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.038 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae] What's your name?

00:06:43.138 --> 00:06:44.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Oh, look!

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:48.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
She has a little name
tag on the front of her dress!

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:49.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mei] That's great!

00:06:49.377 --> 00:06:51.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
Their address
is on the back, too.

00:06:51.446 --> 00:06:53.146 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanae] Oh, it's right
around the corner!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.048 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, I'll lead the way!

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aren't you glad?
You get to go home now!

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.586 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:09.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
Turns out it was a lot
closer than we thought, too!

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:10.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[Sanae] Uh-huh!
-Their parents were so happy,

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.762 position:5% line:83% align:start
they looked like they
were about to cry.

00:07:12.862 --> 00:07:15.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stop sulking like
a little baby, Sunohara!

00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:17.066 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get over here!

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:19.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
We didn't make you mad,
did we, Youhei?

00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:21.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nah, it's not that.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just feels like this stuff put a
damper on our date, that's all.

00:07:24.372 --> 00:07:27.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
Get over it!
What's wrong with you?!

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:29.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [chuckle]

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:31.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't be so grouchy,
Youhei, it's fine.

00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:35.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
In fact, if you don't mind, I'd
like to do this again sometime.

00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:36.881 position:61% line:89% align:start
You mean it?

00:07:36.982 --> 00:07:39.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had a lot of fun with you
today and I'm very flattered

00:07:39.283 --> 00:07:41.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
that you treasure our time
together so much...

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
But sometimes there are more
important things

00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:45.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
to worry about.

00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:49.258 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, no matter what, you can't
lose sight of that, okay?

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:50.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
[sheepish chuckle]

00:07:50.693 --> 00:07:52.727 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [Youhei] Y-you got it!

00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:54.596 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [laughing continues]

00:07:55.463 --> 00:07:57.232 position:16% line:89% align:start
[humming along to music]

00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:00.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah? Huh?

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Okazaki.

00:08:02.136 --> 00:08:03.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
All that...

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
and a toilet.

00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:06.973 position:27% line:83% align:start
  Well, you're in
  high spirits today...

00:08:07.073 --> 00:08:10.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's go grab some lunch...
all that, and a toilet.

00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:12.777 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Just the lunch part for me.

00:08:12.878 --> 00:08:14.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think, I'll have a katsudon.

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:17.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
All that... and a toilet.

00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:18.715 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a unique combination.

00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:20.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, but maybe I should hold out

00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:22.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
since Sanae told me
to eat healthy and stuff.

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:25.554 position:5% line:89% align:start
All that, and a toilet.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:28.490 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I hate
to tell you this,

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:30.492 position:5% line:83% align:start
but Mei was still worried
about you last night.

00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:32.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
She was happy about
your fake girlfriend,

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:35.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
but upset 'cause you haven't
exactly cleaned up your act.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.897 position:38% line:83% align:start
Guess I should start
taking my future

00:08:36.997 --> 00:08:38.631 position:5% line:89% align:start
  a little more seriously, huh?

00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:40.333 position:27% line:89% align:start
 For Sanae's sake, too.

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:42.301 position:27% line:89% align:start
 All that, and a toilet!

00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:45.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is the toilet part just for you,
or is that for Sanae, too?

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.205 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I was little,
there were a bunch of things

00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:48.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanted to be when I grew up.

00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:50.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
A soccer player.

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:51.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [girls cheer]

00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:53.510 position:38% line:83% align:start
-A pilot.
-So cool!

00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:56.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
 -A teacher.
 -He's dreamy!

00:08:56.212 --> 00:08:57.213 position:27% line:89% align:start
 All that...

00:08:57.313 --> 00:08:58.713 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [chuckle]

00:08:58.815 --> 00:09:00.682 position:27% line:89% align:start
...and a toilet!

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:03.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think that last one's
gonna give you some trouble.

00:09:03.351 --> 00:09:05.087 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei growls]

00:09:05.187 --> 00:09:06.354 position:50% line:89% align:start
 I can't do it!

00:09:06.455 --> 00:09:07.688 position:38% line:83% align:start
 This "all that
 and a toilet" thing

00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:09.622 position:16% line:89% align:start
is ruining everything I say!

00:09:09.722 --> 00:09:12.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right... then why don't
you just stop doing it?

00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:14.760 position:38% line:83% align:start
It was your idea
in the first place!

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Are you sure?!

00:09:17.663 --> 00:09:20.065 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's fine. I won't
get mad today.

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:23.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
 As they say, "A man
 in love is forgiving."

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:24.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're in a good mood, huh?

00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:26.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
Of course I am.

00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:28.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sanae said she's gonna call me
as soon as school is over.

00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:30.140 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.309 position:38% line:83% align:start
She must have fallen
for me after all!

00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:33.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's nice and all...

00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:35.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
but maybe you should
think about how Mei fee-

00:09:35.777 --> 00:09:36.978 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, if I marry Sanae...

00:09:37.078 --> 00:09:39.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
and then you get
married to Nagisa...

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
  we'll be brothers, right?

00:09:41.049 --> 00:09:44.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's great, I always
wanted a little bro!

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.286 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [loud chewing]

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.689 position:50% line:89% align:start
This is good!

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I feel like this is
doing more harm than good.

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:56.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
You may be right. He seems even
stupider than yesterday.

00:09:56.627 --> 00:09:58.028 position:61% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:03.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hi, Mei! I guess you're
waiting for Sunohara?

00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:05.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep. But wait,
he's not with you guys?

00:10:06.002 --> 00:10:08.137 position:38% line:83% align:start
He said he was in
a rush to get home.

00:10:08.238 --> 00:10:09.771 position:27% line:83% align:start
He didn't want to miss
an important call

00:10:09.872 --> 00:10:10.973 position:38% line:89% align:start
from his girlfriend.

00:10:11.073 --> 00:10:13.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jeez. He is hopeless, isn't he?

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:16.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [groaning]

00:10:16.743 --> 00:10:19.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
No offense, but could
you please go away?

00:10:19.413 --> 00:10:20.881 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hey, Sunohara...

00:10:20.981 --> 00:10:22.848 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your sister came all this way
to check on you

00:10:22.948 --> 00:10:24.518 position:16% line:83% align:start
and you pull that
kind of attitude?

00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:26.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's your problem?

00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:28.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
When one is faced with this
beautiful thing called love,

00:10:28.487 --> 00:10:30.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
who has time
for a little sister?

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:32.956 position:5% line:83% align:start
Man, I didn't know
what I was missing!

00:10:33.057 --> 00:10:35.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
And speaking of which,
since everything's fine here,

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:37.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
why don't you head
back home, Mei?

00:10:37.427 --> 00:10:39.463 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I'm not ready to leave yet.

00:10:39.563 --> 00:10:42.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are still some things
I have to do while I'm here.

00:10:42.532 --> 00:10:44.799 position:5% line:83% align:start
You still have things
you gotta do?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.635 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, so that's it, huh?

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:48.736 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you guys talking about?

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
In other words,

00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:51.739 position:5% line:83% align:start
this whole "checking up on
her brother" thing

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
was just an excuse
to have some fun.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's always liked it here,

00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:58.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it sure beats sticking
around back home with the folks.

00:10:58.611 --> 00:10:59.978 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.248 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:03.348 --> 00:11:04.416 position:5% line:89% align:start
Told you!

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:06.618 position:38% line:83% align:start
But I'm not just
here to have fun.

00:11:06.717 --> 00:11:09.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
I came because I wanted
to see my boyfriend too.

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:12.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
Y-your boyfriend?!

00:11:12.455 --> 00:11:14.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
I met him on my last trip here.

00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:15.559 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's a little older than me,

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:17.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he's really mature
and really sweet.

00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:19.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's always talking about
how cute I am,

00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:21.564 position:5% line:83% align:start
and he teaches me
all kinds of fun stuff.

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:23.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, where did this come from?

00:11:23.797 --> 00:11:26.166 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you're in love, who
has time for a big brother?

00:11:26.266 --> 00:11:27.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
I said, wait!

00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:28.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who the hell is this guy-

00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:30.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mei] I'm supposed
to meet him right now.

00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd better get going.

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:34.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [door opens]

00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:37.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure is nice having someone
who cares for you, isn't it?

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.478 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mei, wait! Come back!

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:43.280 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey! You're not gonna let
her go like that, are you?!

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.781 position:5% line:89% align:start
I-I dunno.

00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:47.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I go after her, I might
end up missing Sanae's call...

00:11:47.585 --> 00:11:49.118 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you still stuck on that?

00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:50.719 position:5% line:83% align:start
What are you gonna do if this
guy turns out to be

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:52.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
some kinda asshole?!

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.855 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but you can't tell
someone who to love.

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:56.724 position:27% line:89% align:start
[uneasy chuckle]

00:11:56.824 --> 00:11:58.159 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:07.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
Youhei?

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:08.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:11.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry,
I hate to disappoint you.

  [sighing]

00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:32.587 position:5% line:5% align:start
I understand you were upset,

00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:36.223 position:5% line:5% align:start
but don't you think you might've
taken it a little too far?

00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:37.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
So what now?

00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:39.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like you just made
things more complicated.

00:12:39.727 --> 00:12:41.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hate seeing Youhei like that.

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:43.128 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:44.830 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even though
I was just pretending,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wanted him to get
mad and try to stop me.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:50.835 position:38% line:83% align:start
 He could've hit me
 for all I care.

00:12:50.935 --> 00:12:53.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Better than just ignoring me...

00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:56.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's like he
doesn't even care...

00:12:58.774 --> 00:13:02.611 position:5% line:77% align:start
When I was little,
the kids in the neighborhood
used to pick on me.

00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:04.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
They were always making me cry.

00:13:04.546 --> 00:13:05.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
But even if I was upset,

00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:08.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
I knew my brother would be
there to save me.

00:13:08.283 --> 00:13:11.518 position:5% line:83% align:start
As soon as I cried out,
he'd come running to my rescue,

00:13:11.618 --> 00:13:12.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
just like magic.

00:13:12.985 --> 00:13:15.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
He'd yell, "You better
not make Mei cry,"

00:13:15.622 --> 00:13:17.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
and all the bullies
would scramble.

00:13:17.822 --> 00:13:19.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
It made me feel so loved...

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.160 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't have a fear
in the world.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
When Youhei was in middle
school,

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.731 position:5% line:89% align:start
he started playing soccer.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
He was really good at it too.

00:13:30.668 --> 00:13:33.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wasn't the only one who
depended on him anymore...

00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:35.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
his whole team did.

00:13:37.205 --> 00:13:40.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's like he isn't even
my real brother anymore.

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:42.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
My real brother wouldn't
abandon some poor girl

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
who was being picked on
by bullies.

00:13:44.811 --> 00:13:46.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
My real brother
wouldn't let me go out

00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:47.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
with some guy he doesn't know!

-[Tomoya sighs]

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:50.849 position:5% line:89% align:start
the girl I saw yesterday

00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:52.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
isn't really Youhei's
girlfriend, is she?

00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:55.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I can't say I'm surprised
you figured it out.

00:13:55.853 --> 00:13:58.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
Um, actually,
his girlfriend is my mom.

00:13:58.656 --> 00:14:00.258 position:16% line:89% align:start
He thinks she's my sister.

00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:03.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for lying, we just
didn't want you to worry.

00:14:03.627 --> 00:14:05.861 position:5% line:89% align:start
 That's what I thought... Jeez.

00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:08.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's hopeless, isn't he?
What can I say?

00:14:08.964 --> 00:14:11.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry he's
so much trouble...

00:14:11.734 --> 00:14:14.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh no, we don't think
of him that way...

00:14:16.904 --> 00:14:19.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
He really is hopeless...

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:25.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you have a date with
Sunohara again today?

00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:27.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:29.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, I have to make
up for what happened last time.

00:14:29.147 --> 00:14:30.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now that Mei knows,

00:14:30.582 --> 00:14:33.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
you don't really have to wear
a disguise anymore...

00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:35.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know, but it's fun
and the look is starting

00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:37.053 position:16% line:89% align:start
to grow on me a bit.

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:39.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, what are you guys up to?

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:41.725 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? S-Sanae!

00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:43.292 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, Dad, I'm impressed!

00:14:43.392 --> 00:14:45.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
You saw through mom's
disguise in no time flat!

00:14:45.993 --> 00:14:47.895 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's nothing bad.
I can explain.

00:14:47.995 --> 00:14:50.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah! Mom, it's a secret!
Shh... Shh...

00:14:50.832 --> 00:14:54.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, now you really got me
wondering what's going on.

00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:56.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
We were rehearsing for
a play, that's all.

00:14:57.002 --> 00:14:59.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
-A play?
-[Tomoya] That's right.

00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:00.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
We wanted Sanae to help us,

00:15:00.706 --> 00:15:03.108 position:5% line:83% align:start
so we were having her
try on a couple of costumes.

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:04.409 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Yeah?

00:15:04.777 --> 00:15:06.044 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hmm.

00:15:07.145 --> 00:15:09.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are these the only costumes
you got to work with,

00:15:09.446 --> 00:15:11.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
'cause it looks like
they're all for girls...

00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:12.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Sanae, Get out of here...
-What kinda play

00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:14.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
-while he's distracted, hurry!
-are you putting on?

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:15.819 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Oh, okay! See you.
-Oh, uh, I'm not sure yet.

00:15:15.918 --> 00:15:18.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're still brainstorming...

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:21.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? Where did Sanae
take off to?

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
She, uh, probably got
embarrassed and ran away.

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:26.327 position:5% line:89% align:start
So cute and innocent,

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:27.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'd think she's
still in high school.

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:30.196 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, what's
the story to your play?

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:33.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
Story? Actually, Nagisa's
the one in charge of that.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's got a bit of
writer's block right now,

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.302 position:50% line:83% align:start
so maybe you can
help her out.

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:40.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
In the meantime, we'll, uh,
go look for your wife, 'kay?

00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:41.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure, leave it to me.

anything, so I'm not sure.

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:52.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was just going to tag
along with Sanae.

00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:53.816 position:38% line:89% align:start
Whatever.

00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:56.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we can trust Sanae to
take care of things on her end.

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:59.454 position:16% line:83% align:start

  have some fun for once?

The Maharaja crepe
looks pretty good...

00:18:04.053 --> 00:18:05.455 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, I'm sure! Please?

00:18:05.555 --> 00:18:08.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can I have the Princess Crepe,
Big Brother?

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
 It's super-duper yummy!

 <i>And I'm a super-duper chump.</i>

00:18:15.396 --> 00:18:17.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
Here, Big Brother,
you have a try!

00:18:17.331 --> 00:18:19.534 position:5% line:83% align:start
I could have one bite,
I guess.

 Ah!

00:18:24.404 --> 00:18:26.806 position:16% line:89% align:start
You ate the only strawberry!

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:29.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you said I
could have some, so...

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:31.142 position:27% line:89% align:start
I hate you, Big Brother.

00:18:31.242 --> 00:18:33.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
No! Please!
Anything but that!

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:37.381 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Then take a picture
 with me over there.

00:18:37.481 --> 00:18:39.316 position:38% line:83% align:start
If you do that,
I'll forgive you.

00:18:39.416 --> 00:18:41.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
No way. That's so lame.

00:18:41.484 --> 00:18:43.920 position:16% line:83% align:start

 -All right, all right!

[Mei] Is this how it works?

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:47.289 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Hm? I don't know.

Haven't seen you in hours.
Where'd you go?

00:19:27.555 --> 00:19:29.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was out
with my girlfriend.

Now what the hell
are you two doing here?

00:19:31.358 --> 00:19:33.492 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What do you mean?
We were looking for...

00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:35.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:19:37.496 --> 00:19:39.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
You going to explain
this to me?

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.131 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who cares?
It's none of your business!

00:19:41.232 --> 00:19:42.500 position:38% line:89% align:start
Give it back!

  [sighing]

00:19:44.002 --> 00:19:45.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like the cat's

00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:46.937 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Huh?

00:19:47.037 --> 00:19:48.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's exactly what
you're thinking.

00:19:48.639 --> 00:19:51.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
The boyfriend Mei was talking
about is none other than me.

00:19:51.507 --> 00:19:54.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
So what, are you just
stringing Nagisa along?

00:19:54.476 --> 00:19:56.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
For now.
Until I dump her at least.

00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:58.647 position:38% line:83% align:start
Listen, I'll be
honest with you...

00:19:58.747 --> 00:20:01.016 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mei stayed over
at my place last night.

00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:02.215 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right, Mei?

00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:03.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
Y-yeah, that's right.

00:20:03.818 --> 00:20:07.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was just me and Okazaki
together all night.

00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:12.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well... let's get
out of here, Mei.

00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:14.392 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Oh, right.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, come back...

00:20:20.197 --> 00:20:22.265 position:27% line:89% align:start
I said wait...

00:20:23.132 --> 00:20:25.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [frustrated grunt]

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.377 position:5% line:89% align:start
How did it turn out like this?

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.380 position:16% line:89% align:start
Damn it...

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:02.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] And that's
the last you saw of him?

00:21:02.164 --> 00:21:05.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, we just made
something up to make him worry.

00:21:05.934 --> 00:21:08.903 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is my fault.
Sorry for dragging you in...

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] No, it's fine.

00:21:10.404 --> 00:21:12.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
But even after
I tried to make him angry,

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:14.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
he still wouldn't say anything.

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:16.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought he'd show us
his big brother side,

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:18.911 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it just didn't happen.

00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:22.114 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Mei] Of course not.

00:21:22.213 --> 00:21:24.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
My brother doesn't care
what happens to me.

00:21:24.582 --> 00:21:26.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't say that, Mei!
That isn't true!

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:30.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
Still, I don't think it was
right to lie to him like that.

00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:33.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen... I hate to say it,
but maybe you should head home.

00:21:33.856 --> 00:21:35.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've been missing
school for a week now,

00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:37.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure your parents
are worried about you.

00:21:37.927 --> 00:21:39.528 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, I can't go home yet.

00:21:39.628 --> 00:21:42.130 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not until my brother
pulls himself together.

00:21:42.229 --> 00:21:44.465 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Tomoya sighs]
-Okazaki...

00:21:44.565 --> 00:21:47.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems like everything
started to go wrong for Youhei

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:48.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
after he left the soccer club.

00:21:48.969 --> 00:21:51.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
If he had the chance to play
again, then he might get better!

00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:54.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
He might be like the big brother
I grew up with!

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have to find a way
to get him back on the team.

00:21:57.308 --> 00:21:58.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I don't think
that'll be easy.

00:21:58.877 --> 00:22:01.211 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not after what happened between
him and the other members.

00:22:01.312 --> 00:22:03.413 position:5% line:89% align:start
Surely you realize that, right?

00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:05.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
None of that matters.

00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:07.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the only choice
we have left.

00:23:42.426 --> 00:23:44.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Besides,
I'm busy with Sanae.

00:23:44.328 --> 00:23:46.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't have time to worry about
every little thing Mei is doing.

00:23:46.898 --> 00:23:49.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, Mei, are you sure you
don't want to rethink

00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:50.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
this whole thing?

00:23:52.768 --> 00:23:54.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] There are a lot of
wonderful things about him,

00:23:54.904 --> 00:23:58.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
he just has a hard time
showing his good side to people.

00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:11.551 position:16% line:83% align:start
You sure you want
to do this, Okazaki?
