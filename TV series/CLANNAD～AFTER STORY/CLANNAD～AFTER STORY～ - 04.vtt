  â™ª

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:51.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] So what
was that all about?

00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:52.992 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
What do you mean?

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:54.925 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mei's staying here, right?

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:57.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looked like you guys were
having fun together yesterday.

00:01:57.527 --> 00:01:59.928 position:16% line:83% align:start
We couldn't figure out
what you two were doing.

00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:02.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was surprised to see that
Mei hadn't gone home yet.

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:04.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to hang out
with Mei, too.

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:08.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can play violin for hours and
hours - as much as she wants!

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's assuming she can stay
conscious, of course.

00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why are you such a bully, Kyou?

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:17.004 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mei's too worried about
Sunohara to go back home.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.572 position:16% line:83% align:start
We were up all night
thinking about what to do.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei] <i>We have to find a way</i>
 <i>to get him back on the team.</i>

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:25.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
If he had the chance to play
again, then he might get better!

00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:28.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
He might be like the big brother
I grew up with!

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:30.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou]
That's not gonna happen!

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:31.478 position:5% line:89% align:start
I get what she means,

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:33.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
but there's no way
he can go back to the team now.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:35.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what I said, but she
still wasn't convinced.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sunohara wouldn't have left
the club in the first place

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:39.848 position:38% line:83% align:start
if those guys
weren't such jerks.

00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:41.249 position:16% line:89% align:start
Either way around,

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.850 position:16% line:83% align:start
you're better off not
getting involved with them.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.451 position:16% line:89% align:start
  Just find something else.

00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:45.984 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think she's right.

00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:47.486 position:27% line:83% align:start
The way the
Soccer Club operates,

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:48.919 position:27% line:83% align:start
there might not be
much he can do.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.655 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi]
You mean they're bullies?

00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:52.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] You throw that
word around a lot...

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:55.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
but for once,
you hit the nail on the head.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
He wasn't at the dorm either?

00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:02.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mei]
No. And I asked Misae,

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:05.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
but she said she hadn't
seen him all day either.

00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:06.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]
What should we do now?

00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:08.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't ask Sunohara
to join the soccer team

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.698 position:5% line:89% align:start
if we can't even find him.

00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:12.565 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen, Mei, are you
sure you don't want

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:14.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
to rethink this whole thing?

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I just don't think
 it's going to work out.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.603 position:16% line:83% align:start
In that case,
I'll go ask them on my own.

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.270 position:50% line:83% align:start
Wait, ask who?
The soccer team?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.405 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't want to go,
that's fine,

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:26.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I have to give it a shot.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:28.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just wait here,
I'll be right back.

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:30.940 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't be ridiculous!
I can't let you do that!

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:32.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya is right!
If you're going to talk to them,

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:35.143 position:5% line:89% align:start
then we're going with you!

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.480 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Huh? Hmm?

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.182 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Youhei Sunohara?
-Huh?

00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:48.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
The next soccer season
starts in the winter, right?

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:50.251 position:16% line:83% align:start
That means the seniors still
have a chance to play

00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.352 position:38% line:89% align:start
if they like.

00:03:51.452 --> 00:03:53.919 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's just one semester,
please let him play.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
[scoffs] You gotta
be kidding me!

00:03:56.154 --> 00:03:58.655 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to see that
little shit's face ever again!

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.189 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Get outta here.
-[Mei] Uh...

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know Youhei must've caused
you a lot of trouble,

00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:04.024 position:5% line:89% align:start
but he's still my brother.

00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:07.160 position:16% line:83% align:start
He sent his sister
to beg for him, huh?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know what happened
and I won't make make excuses...

00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:12.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
but he still deserves
a second chance!

00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:13.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
People say he's
good for nothing,

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he wasn't always like that.
I want him to-

00:04:15.764 --> 00:04:17.598 position:27% line:83% align:start
Of course people say
he's good for nothing.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.032 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's 'cause it's true.

00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:20.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
[player 2] Yeah, so why should
we waste our time

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
with someone who ain't
worth crap to begin with?

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.670 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought you had the sense
to know your place, Okazaki,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I guess you're
no better than him.

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:30.237 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your friend there's
a nice fit, too.

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
She got held back
a grade, didn't she?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.240 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [laughing]

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.942 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't you little turds stick
with your own kind, all right?

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya, don't.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm sorry, you guys.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
I should've gone
there myself first.

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:53.183 position:5% line:89% align:start
 I'm the one who suggested it.

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:55.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for making you go
through something so unpleasant.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.820 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's fine, we both knew it
wasn't going to be easy.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here, Mei, would you
like a little refill?

00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:04.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, sure. I guess I didn't
realize I drank it all.

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:06.557 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
We're sorry to barge in.

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:08.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know it sounds strange,

00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:09.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
but somehow, it seemed like
you were the right person

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.025 position:16% line:89% align:start
to share our problems with.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nothing to apologize for.

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:15.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, it's quite
common for people to come here

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:19.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
and talk about their troubles,
so I'm perfectly used to it.

00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:23.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Okazaki...

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:25.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
Could you tell me
what happened between Sunohara

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:27.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
and the Soccer Club?

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:30.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I know the whole story,
then maybe I could help.

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:32.470 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's up to you, Mei,
can I tell her?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [affirmative grunt]

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
Back when he was a freshmen,

00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
he got in a big fight with
the other members of the club.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.041 position:5% line:89% align:start
By the time he joined the team,

00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
a group of guys had
already taken charge.

00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:49.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since he was a new recruit,
he got bossed around a lot.

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:52.413 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's been like that
for years with that team.

00:05:52.513 --> 00:05:56.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
They use some stupid hierarchy
as an excuse to pick on people.

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
Anyway, as you can guess,

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara didn't take
that very well.

00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:08.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right after that, the two of us
met for the first time.

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:11.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd just gotten into a fight
myself and we both ended up

00:06:11.256 --> 00:06:13.157 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the Principal's office
at the same time.

00:06:13.257 --> 00:06:14.991 position:38% line:83% align:start
We've been friends
ever since then.

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:18.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
He never said anything
about that to me.

00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:20.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] At any rate,
because of the fight,

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
the team had to withdraw from
the rookie tournament that year.

00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:25.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
After that, Sunohara quit
and never came back.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.131 position:5% line:89% align:start
And even after all this time,

00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:28.698 position:16% line:83% align:start
those guys on the
soccer team still blame him

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:29.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
for what happened...

00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:32.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see. But even if
they did accept him,

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
would he have any fun playing
soccer on a team like that?

00:06:35.835 --> 00:06:37.369 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't really know.

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
But either way,
I still feel like soccer

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.738 position:5% line:83% align:start
is the only way to get
his life back on track.

00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:43.305 position:16% line:89% align:start
You may be right.

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.640 position:5% line:83% align:start
Still I don't see much point
in getting worked up about this

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.040 position:16% line:89% align:start
when he's not even around.

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:50.743 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sighing] Poor Youhei.
What am I gonna do with him?

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure if
I mentioned it before,

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I have an
older brother, myself.

00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:56.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, I don't think
you've ever

00:06:56.245 --> 00:06:58.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
talked about yourself, Miyazawa.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:00.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
My brother hardly ever went to
school.

00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:02.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
He spent all of his time
fooling around,

00:07:02.114 --> 00:07:03.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
and he was always
getting into fights.

00:07:03.816 --> 00:07:07.785 position:5% line:83% align:start
In fact, he was even picked
up by the police a few times.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
That must've been
really hard on you...

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:11.153 position:50% line:89% align:start
  I never knew.

00:07:11.253 --> 00:07:14.755 position:5% line:83% align:start
Siblings can
be strange sometimes.

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:17.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
But no matter what, you still
love your brother, don't you?

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yukine] To be honest, I used to
be afraid of him.

00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
But as time went by, I started
to understand him a bit better.

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.294 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are a lot of wonderful
things about him,

00:07:26.394 --> 00:07:29.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
he just has a hard time
showing his good side to people.

00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:33.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
He can be a bit awkward, but
deep down I think he's sweet.

00:07:33.264 --> 00:07:34.865 position:27% line:89% align:start
You know, it's funny,

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:37.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think Sanae said
the same about Sunohara.

00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:39.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yukine] Don't worry, Mei.

00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:41.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sure there are plenty
of wonderful things

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:43.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
about Sunohara as well.

00:07:43.102 --> 00:07:45.403 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if things don't work out
with the soccer team,

00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:47.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
all he needs is
a chance to shine

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:50.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
and he'll be back to the brother
you love in no time.

00:07:50.473 --> 00:07:53.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, how are things between
you and your brother now?

00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:55.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, we're very close, of course!

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.276 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [slight gasp]

00:08:03.447 --> 00:08:06.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sunohara,
what were you doing yesterday?

00:08:06.414 --> 00:08:08.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? It's none
of your business.

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:12.017 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aren't you worried about Mei?
After everything we said?

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's funny,
coming from you.

00:08:14.218 --> 00:08:16.619 position:27% line:83% align:start
Isn't it your job
to take care of her now?

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:18.454 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, I'm busy
with Sanae.

00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:21.589 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't have time to worry about
every little thing Mei is doing.

00:08:22.622 --> 00:08:25.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] And that's it?
You really mean that?

00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:26.825 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Yeah, of course I meant it.

00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:28.292 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I'm leaving Mei to you.

00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:30.193 position:16% line:89% align:start
Take good care of her, okay?

00:08:30.293 --> 00:08:32.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on,
don't give me that crap.

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:34.328 position:38% line:83% align:start
What are you
so pissed off about?

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:36.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Mei doesn't
care about me, either...

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:37.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sunohara!

00:08:38.063 --> 00:08:39.431 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.899 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okazaki! Sunohara!

00:08:40.998 --> 00:08:43.233 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you know what Mei's
doing right now? Huh?

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
What? Other than
having fun with you?

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:46.902 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you getting at?

00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ask the soccer team
what she's been doing!

00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:50.169 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then you try and tell me

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:52.572 position:16% line:83% align:start
your sister doesn't care
about you anymore!

00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:55.806 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not making
any damn sense.

00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:56.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just come out and say it.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, please, let him go!

00:08:59.007 --> 00:09:01.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you fighting about?

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:04.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really want
to do this, Okazaki?

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.912 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, break it up!

00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are you doing?
Who started this?!

00:09:10.146 --> 00:09:11.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ryou, why are they fighting?

00:09:11.914 --> 00:09:13.415 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I-I don't even know...

00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:15.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, Sunohara,
you two are friends,

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:18.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're not supposed to fight!

00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:19.751 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scoffs]

00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:22.153 position:27% line:83% align:start
 -Tomoya!
 -Tomoya, wait!

00:09:22.787 --> 00:09:24.087 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [door closes]

00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:27.522 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sunohara, hey, please just
tell me what happened!

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:31.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei]
You got into a fight?

00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:34.125 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yeah... I kinda
lost it for a sec.

00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:35.827 position:27% line:89% align:start
So where's Youhei now?

00:09:35.927 --> 00:09:37.928 position:38% line:83% align:start
I know he's cutting
class at least.

00:09:38.027 --> 00:09:40.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's probably just
screwing around somewhere.

00:09:40.128 --> 00:09:41.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see...

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:43.430 position:27% line:83% align:start
You gonna talk to
the soccer team again?

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh. I was
thinking about it

00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:47.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
and after hearing Miyazawa's
story yesterday,

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
I felt like I couldn't
give up just yet.

00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:53.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Uh, wait... I really can
  do it by myself this time.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is between me
and my brother.

00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:57.203 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't want to trouble
you with my problems anymore!

00:09:57.303 --> 00:09:59.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't say that, Mei!
It's no trouble at all!

00:09:59.472 --> 00:10:02.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know how you feel, Nagisa,
but leave this to us.

00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:04.174 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Why? Is something wrong?

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:06.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
You saw what kind of thugs
they have on the soccer team.

00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:08.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who knows what might happen
if we make them angry.

00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:11.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no reason to for me
and Mei to put you in danger.

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:12.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't let you do that!

00:10:13.044 --> 00:10:15.514 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it's that dangerous, then I
don't want you two to go alone!

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:17.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but if a big fight
breaks out, then what?

00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:19.916 position:5% line:83% align:start
If they start throwing punches,
I won't be able to look out

00:10:20.048 --> 00:10:22.216 position:16% line:83% align:start
for you and Mei
at the same time!

00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:25.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
In that case, we'll be fine.

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:28.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll just take Mei
and we'll run away together.

00:10:28.152 --> 00:10:30.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
That way, even if
something happens to you,

00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:33.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mei and I will still have
each other to count on.

00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:35.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
When it comes to
stuff like this,

00:10:35.757 --> 00:10:38.258 position:16% line:83% align:start
you really are stubborn
as hell, aren't you?

00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:42.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
[captain] Can't take "no"
for an answer, huh?

00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:43.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
Yeah, I know it's a long shot...

00:10:44.094 --> 00:10:45.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're begging you...

00:10:45.462 --> 00:10:47.530 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, <i>please</i> let Sunohara
back on the team!

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.831 position:5% line:83% align:start
He doesn't even have
to play in any real games,

00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:52.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
just let him practice with
the team and we'll be happy!

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.099 position:5% line:89% align:start
And then what?

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:56.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure, we could do it,
but what's in it for us?

00:10:56.768 --> 00:10:59.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why would we want some punk-ass
bitch getting in our way?

00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.570 position:5% line:89% align:start
If there's something you want,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.638 position:16% line:83% align:start
then just tell me
and I'll do it for you!

00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:04.070 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't care what it takes!

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, Captain, hurry.
Let's get back to practice!

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:08.273 position:5% line:83% align:start
[player 4]
Forget about those guys,

00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:09.774 position:5% line:89% align:start
we got better things to do!

00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:12.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -Right!
 -No, you can't leave!

00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:14.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know we're being
unreasonable...

00:11:14.276 --> 00:11:17.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
But please give us a chance.
I'm begging you.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wow, I've never seen Okazaki bow
his head to someone like this...

00:11:24.882 --> 00:11:27.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
I heard you weren't the same old
punk you used to be.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess it's true.

00:11:28.784 --> 00:11:30.618 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okazaki...

00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:33.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why don't you be
a ball boy or something?

00:11:33.853 --> 00:11:35.353 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Thank you very much!

00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:38.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the best, Okazaki,
that was wonderful!

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:40.189 position:16% line:89% align:start
  You were amazing, Tomoya!

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not that big of a deal.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now let's do a good job
fetching the balls.

00:11:44.158 --> 00:11:45.659 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Right!

00:11:57.264 --> 00:11:59.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take it easy, all right, Nagisa?

00:11:59.265 --> 00:12:00.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't push yourself
too hard and get hurt.

00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:04.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm fine. Don't worry about me,
just keep an eye on Mei.

00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:07.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, ball boy, go get it!

Are you okay?

-[Tomoya] Those assholes...

00:13:13.303 --> 00:13:14.671 position:38% line:89% align:start
No, it's my fault.

00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
I-I just wasn't paying
attention, that's all.

00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:18.974 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Mei, stop... please...

00:13:19.074 --> 00:13:23.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
I-I'm fine...
Really, it was nothing...

Hey, wake up out there!

00:13:28.878 --> 00:13:30.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:39.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mei]
Uh, I think that does it.

00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:41.351 position:16% line:89% align:start
 All right, good job.

00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:43.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
Where, uh, are the
other team members?

00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:46.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
-They went home.
-Huh?

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:48.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
Practice is over.
What do you expect?

00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:49.455 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just talk to us.

00:13:49.555 --> 00:13:52.256 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll pass it along
to the other guys, okay?

00:13:52.357 --> 00:13:54.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, what did you want?

00:13:54.391 --> 00:13:56.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was my brother,
Youhei Sunohara, remember?

00:13:56.692 --> 00:13:59.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
We wondered if he could join
the team again...

00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.995 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, sorry. Can't do it.

00:14:01.095 --> 00:14:02.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:04.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
We don't want a loser
like him on the team...

00:14:04.396 --> 00:14:07.098 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's why we kicked him
off in the first place.

00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:09.264 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know.
That guy's useless, right?

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:11.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
He never stops running
his mouth, either.

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:13.101 position:5% line:89% align:start
Needs to learn some manners.

00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:16.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
Face it, he sucks at soccer,
sucks at school,

00:14:16.369 --> 00:14:18.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
and fails at life.

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:19.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
He can be a screwup
on his own time,

00:14:19.904 --> 00:14:22.238 position:5% line:83% align:start
but we don't need trash
like him stinking up the team.

00:14:22.338 --> 00:14:23.673 position:50% line:89% align:start
 But you said...

00:14:23.773 --> 00:14:25.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's your problem?

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
You guys need to
wake up already.

00:14:28.308 --> 00:14:30.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you ask Sunohara
about this plan of yours?

00:14:30.242 --> 00:14:32.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
  -He knows what you're up to.
  -Huh?

00:14:32.944 --> 00:14:35.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, he was asking one of
the freshmen kids about it.

00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:37.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now what do you know he
still doesn't have the guts

00:14:38.047 --> 00:14:39.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
to show up!

00:14:39.514 --> 00:14:41.482 position:5% line:83% align:start
[player 1] The little punk
left you out in the cold.

00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:43.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
He makes his sister
do all his dirty work,

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
then he pussies out
and runs away!

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a joke!

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.351 position:5% line:89% align:start
[player 2] He's useless.

00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:49.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop wasting your time on him.

00:14:51.687 --> 00:14:52.754 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, Mei...

00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:54.254 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh man, you made her cry.

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:56.722 position:16% line:83% align:start
Enough of this crap already.
Go home!

00:14:56.822 --> 00:14:58.289 position:16% line:89% align:start
 You... you're wrong!

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.158 position:5% line:83% align:start
My brother isn't running away!
He'll come! You just wait!

00:15:01.258 --> 00:15:02.760 position:50% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you,
he ain't coming!

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
He is! I know because
my brother always comes

00:15:05.827 --> 00:15:07.662 position:5% line:89% align:start
when I'm in trouble!

00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:09.663 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Don't cry...

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:11.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
What, have you got
brain worms or something?

00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:14.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
Go figure. I guess stupidity
runs in the family.

00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:16.165 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:17.366 position:5% line:89% align:start
That all you got?

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:19.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you don't scream louder,

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:20.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
your big brother won't be
able to hear you!

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.201 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [loud crying]

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:24.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Cut it out!
 What's wrong with you?!

00:15:24.604 --> 00:15:27.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
What? You gonna take
all of us on by yourself?

00:15:27.905 --> 00:15:30.205 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Come on!
-Stop! That hurts!

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.907 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let her go!

00:15:32.007 --> 00:15:34.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Tomoya, wait!
-I'm sorry, Nagisa.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
I shut my mouth and I held
my temper for Mei's sake,

00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:38.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I've had enough!

00:15:40.612 --> 00:15:42.212 position:38% line:89% align:start
Youhei!

00:15:42.312 --> 00:15:46.515 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:58.387 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't make my little sister cry!

then you mess with me,

00:16:02.756 --> 00:16:03.891 position:27% line:89% align:start
 you got that?!

[Tomoya] I don't know...

00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:50.714 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I'm pretty sure
we didn't lose...

You idiot...

calling an idiot?

 Who the hell do you think?

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:01.986 position:38% line:83% align:start
You'd better
apologize to Mei.

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:04.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Why?

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.321 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you had your
goddamn act together,

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:08.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
none of this crap would've
happened in the first place.

Man, you really are
a bad brother.

You picking a fight with me?

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I guess.

00:17:23.464 --> 00:17:25.398 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, you two!
What are you doing?!

00:17:25.498 --> 00:17:28.232 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please don't fight.
I've had enough!

 You son of a bitch!

Do you have any idea

00:17:43.707 --> 00:17:45.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
how much Mei has been suffering
because of you?!

00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:48.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the one who's supposed
to be taking care of her!

00:17:50.811 --> 00:17:52.345 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's enough!

00:17:52.445 --> 00:17:53.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're Mei's brother,
aren't you?

00:17:53.912 --> 00:17:55.546 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you think about
her feelings for once!

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.814 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -But I did!
 -Don't give me that!

00:17:57.914 --> 00:17:59.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
You little sister starts

00:17:59.749 --> 00:18:01.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
and you don't do a damned
thing about it?

00:18:01.483 --> 00:18:02.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
You weren't even worried?!

00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:04.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course I was worried!

00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:08.221 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then why didn't you do
something about it, huh?!

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you got an excuse,
I'm dying to hear it!

00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:12.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
I let it go it because
it was you, damn it!

 [gasp]

thinking with this soccer crap?

00:18:18.592 --> 00:18:21.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
You butt your nose in

00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:24.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
 It's over now! Just let it go!

00:18:24.428 --> 00:18:26.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please stop fighting!

were her boyfriend!

 Shut up... you bastard!

00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:38.969 position:5% line:83% align:start
You dumped Nagisa because you
wanted to be with Mei, right?!

00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:41.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then you better get your

Nagisa? What are
you doing here?

00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:20.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
maybe you should stay

don't you think you should stay

  [laughing]

00:19:50.438 --> 00:19:52.439 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What happened to you?
-They're all beat up!

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.041 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like they're
having fun to me...

00:20:01.644 --> 00:20:03.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]
I got a letter from Mei.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.480 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] A letter? Would've been
faster if she just called you.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
She really wanted to make
a big impression, I guess.

00:20:08.915 --> 00:20:10.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
She told me to take good care
of her big brother.

00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:13.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
Guess we made a good impression
pounding on each other,

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
because she said she wants to
find a best friend just like me.

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:18.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh... it's funny, because I
guess it's true when people say

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:21.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
"the friends you make in school
will be your friends for life."

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:23.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
But since we can't act this
stupid forever...

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:27.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
I say we should enjoy it
while we still can.

00:20:27.191 --> 00:20:28.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
Probably so...

00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:32.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just one more semester,
then it's all over. Wow...

00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:38.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] All right,
there's the old man.

00:20:38.629 --> 00:20:41.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh man, I'm really starting
to freak out right now!

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:43.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
You going to give up?

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:44.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
I shan't,
for Sanae is my angel

00:20:45.099 --> 00:20:47.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I would face the
fires of Hell for her love!

00:20:47.734 --> 00:20:50.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right then,
good luck with that.

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:52.703 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hello, sir!

00:20:52.803 --> 00:20:55.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? Oh, you're
that Sunohara kid, right?

00:20:55.238 --> 00:20:57.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's up?
Here to buy some bread?

00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.440 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sir, please allow me
to marry your sweet Sanae!

00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:02.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:02.408 --> 00:21:04.210 position:38% line:83% align:start
What's wrong, honey?
You look upset.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.211 position:27% line:83% align:start
 -[snickering]
 -H-honey?!

00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:08.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, you mean even after
all this time,

00:21:08.611 --> 00:21:11.314 position:5% line:83% align:start
you still haven't told Sunohara
the truth about my mom?

00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:13.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Your mom?! Say what?!

00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:16.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, Akio and I
are husband and wife.

00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:18.150 position:38% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
You try to make a move on my
woman, punk, you're gonna die!

00:21:22.185 --> 00:21:23.320 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Youhei screams]

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:25.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get back here!

00:21:25.287 --> 00:21:26.888 position:16% line:89% align:start
 [Tomoya] <i>It's funny...</i>

00:21:26.988 --> 00:21:30.455 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I don't think I'll ever forget</i>
 <i>the first time I met Sunohara.</i>

00:21:42.929 --> 00:21:45.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Some weird guy with bleached</i>

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I couldn't help laughing</i>
 <i>the moment I saw him.</i>

00:21:49.066 --> 00:21:51.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Actually, I think that was</i>
 <i>the first time I really laughed</i>

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:53.201 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>since I came to that school.</i>

00:21:53.301 --> 00:21:54.635 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>He might've looked stupid,</i>

00:21:54.735 --> 00:21:57.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>but it was the kind of</i>
 <i>stupid I wanted in on.</i>

00:21:57.803 --> 00:22:00.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Not much of a story,</i>
 <i>but that's how we met.</i>

00:22:00.972 --> 00:22:04.341 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:22:06.574 --> 00:22:08.942 position:16% line:89% align:start
   <i>We still are now.</i>

[Youhei screams]

00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:44.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
  [Misae]
  Yeah, what a coincidence!

00:23:44.724 --> 00:23:47.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Um, if you'd like, we could...

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.492 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hey, who's that?
-Huh?

00:23:48.592 --> 00:23:51.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like he's from
a different school than us.

00:23:51.661 --> 00:23:53.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Misae] I'd be walking home
with Igarashi right now!

00:23:53.728 --> 00:23:56.764 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems that you have a bunch
of fans in my class, too.

00:23:56.864 --> 00:23:59.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm glad people
still like me at least.

00:23:59.865 --> 00:24:01.366 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though I'm not sure
what they see in a woman

00:24:01.465 --> 00:24:03.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
who scolds people all the time.

00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:05.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] But the thing is,
in a dorm full of filthy guys,

00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:06.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're like a princess...

00:24:06.969 --> 00:24:09.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
like a diamond in
a dunghill, I guess.
