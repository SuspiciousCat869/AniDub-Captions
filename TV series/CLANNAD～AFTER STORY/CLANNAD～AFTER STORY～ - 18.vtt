[TOMOYA] What's wrong?

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.967 position:7% line:89% align:start

C'mon, don't lie to me.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
[USHIO] I'm not supposed to cry.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:29.410 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Who told you that?

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.779 position:30% line:89% align:start
[USHIO] Sanae.

Even she can be strict, huh?
Who knew?

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:37.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
[USHIO] But she said there's one
place where it's okay to cry.

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:40.759 position:24% line:89% align:start
And where is that?

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:45.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
In the bathroom.

00:03:45.898 --> 00:03:51.339 position:10% line:77% align:start
Fair enough. I guess nobody
would see you crying if you did
it in the bathroom.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.277 position:7% line:77% align:start
But if you feel like crying, I
don't think you should have to
hold back.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TOMOYA] You should cry
while you still can.

When you get bigger,
sometimes you can't cry.

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:03.956 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even if you have something
you want to cry about...

this one instead?

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:49.214 position:10% line:83% align:start

rather have a girl's toy, right?

00:04:49.214 --> 00:04:50.849 position:19% line:89% align:start
Instead of a robot...

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.452 position:19% line:89% align:start
Girl toys are boring.

00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:55.088 position:30% line:89% align:start
I like robots.

00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:58.792 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, there's no harm I guess.
It's just a little strange.

00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:46.776 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOMOYA]
So, Sanae planned this...

00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:49.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've grown so much
since I last saw you.

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:52.216 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry,
I don't remember at all.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:56.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I can hardly blame you
since you were so young.

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
We met right on this spot,
actually,

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:02.061 position:13% line:83% align:start
shortly after your mother
Atsuko passed away.

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:06.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't spoken to your father
in quite a while.

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.238 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is he still paying
for his crime?

00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:11.073 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, he's been released
from prison.

00:11:11.073 --> 00:11:13.142 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's back home as far as I know.

00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:16.547 position:30% line:83% align:start
Such a shame;
It must have been hard on you.

00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:18.215 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not really.

00:11:20.218 --> 00:11:24.725 position:7% line:77% align:start
He may have been brash when he
was younger, but he certainly
wasn't THAT foolish.

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:28.429 position:5% line:77% align:start
Both Atsuko and your father were
still in high school when they
got engaged,

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:31.332 position:30% line:83% align:start
so of course,
we were against the marriage.

00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:33.937 position:7% line:83% align:start
After the wedding, your father
dropped out of school.

00:11:33.937 --> 00:11:38.275 position:10% line:77% align:start
He could only afford a tiny
apartment, but they wanted to
live on their own.

00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:42.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
Still, they both seemed
so happy back then.

00:11:42.548 --> 00:11:46.286 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all, he was caring for
the woman he loved.

00:11:46.286 --> 00:11:50.224 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was probably all he
ever wanted in life.

00:11:50.224 --> 00:11:55.363 position:7% line:77% align:start
It wasn't too long after that
when Atsuko became pregnant with
you.

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:57.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
You were certainly
a blessing to them.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
They were thrilled to have you.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:10.215 position:7% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, all good things
must come to an end, I suppose.

00:12:10.215 --> 00:12:15.857 position:7% line:77% align:start
It wasn't long after you were
born that Atsuko passed away in
an accident.

00:12:15.857 --> 00:12:17.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was so crushing for Naoyuki.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.331 position:10% line:77% align:start
At first, I thought he would
never recover from his
depression.

00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:23.099 position:24% line:89% align:start
But he was strong.

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:28.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
He held on to what hope he could
muster and kept pushing on.

00:12:35.215 --> 00:12:37.952 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you know why?

00:12:37.952 --> 00:12:42.792 position:10% line:77% align:start
He couldn't give up on life,
because he was left with you,
Tomoya.

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:45.863 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was determined to
raise you on his own.

00:12:48.032 --> 00:12:49.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
It was long ago,

00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:53.205 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I'll never forget that day,
when he walked away from here,

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:55.508 position:7% line:89% align:start
holding your hand and smiling.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.345 position:13% line:89% align:start
Perhaps you remember now?

00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:00.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
The days after that were
the toughest in his life.

00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:04.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't even imagine how
hard he had to work.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was fired from one
job after another

00:13:06.923 --> 00:13:11.562 position:5% line:77% align:start
and forced to move from place to
place just to keep his head
above water.

00:13:11.562 --> 00:13:16.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
Still, he always did his
best to care for you.

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:20.407 position:10% line:77% align:start
He would try to cheer you up
with toys or sweets whenever he
could spare a little money.

00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:25.614 position:10% line:77% align:start
He sacrificed everything for
you, but he refused to leave you
behind.

00:13:25.614 --> 00:13:29.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he was strict,
perhaps even violent at times,

00:13:29.485 --> 00:13:33.691 position:10% line:77% align:start
but in his heart, I know the
only thing he wanted was to
raise you well,

00:13:33.691 --> 00:13:37.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
even if you were too young
to understand that.

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:41.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it was a very hard life for
him, and nobody's perfect.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.940 position:13% line:77% align:start
I know he often turned to
alcohol to forget his troubles
at work.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.012 position:5% line:77% align:start
I'm sure that must've been hard
for you, dealing with an
alcoholic father.

00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:53.950 position:16% line:77% align:start
And I'm sure he did some
terrible things when he was
drunk.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.589 position:5% line:77% align:start
But please keep in mind that he
chose to live this life with
you,

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:01.259 position:19% line:83% align:start
no matter how painful
it was for him.

00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:02.962 position:21% line:89% align:start
And so you grew up.

00:14:02.962 --> 00:14:04.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
Before long, you were
a fine young man

00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:07.401 position:13% line:83% align:start
who was old enough to make
decisions about his own life.

00:14:07.401 --> 00:14:10.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
But by then, Naoyuki had
already lost everything.

00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:13.409 position:10% line:83% align:start
His career, his reputation,
his friends,

00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:17.114 position:7% line:83% align:start
and even the love of his son,
I'm sure.

00:14:17.114 --> 00:14:21.786 position:10% line:77% align:start
Furukawa told me that you're
suffering in the same way that
Naoyuki was back then.

00:14:21.786 --> 00:14:24.123 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

00:14:24.123 --> 00:14:26.192 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, that's the reason
I came here today.

00:14:26.192 --> 00:14:29.295 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's why I wanted to tell
you everything that I did.

00:14:29.295 --> 00:14:34.603 position:5% line:77% align:start
Because you can understand now;
You can appreciate what kind of
father Naoyuki was.

00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:42.546 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TOMOYA] He'd come home on his
break and bring me candy.

00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:46.685 position:13% line:83% align:start
He always held my hand and
we'd go on walks together.

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.990 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's sad how easily
I forgot all that.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.692 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, even though I know
you're not fond of Naoyuki,

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:56.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
do you think he's a
failure as a father?

00:14:56.297 --> 00:14:57.933 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not really.

00:14:57.933 --> 00:15:01.671 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm a bigger failure as a person
than he ever was as a father.

00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:05.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
Right now, I'm standing in the
same place that my dad did.

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:08.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I don't feel like fighting.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.615 position:19% line:89% align:start
I feel like giving up.

00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:13.086 position:13% line:83% align:start
All I can think of is how
weak and pathetic I am.

00:15:13.086 --> 00:15:17.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
You're not unlike him, you know.

00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:21.864 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think he's weak and pathetic
in his own way, as well.

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:28.306 position:5% line:77% align:start
But even if he wasn't perfect, I
know he worked hard and did
everything he could for you.

00:15:28.306 --> 00:15:33.011 position:5% line:77% align:start
For that reason, no matter what
happens, I'll always be proud of
him.

00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:36.783 position:7% line:83% align:start
As a man, my son may have his
fair share of short comings,

00:15:36.783 --> 00:15:40.989 position:5% line:83% align:start
but as a father, I truly believe
that he did a good job.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] I...

00:15:44.894 --> 00:15:46.929 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think so too.

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:49.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
And there's nothing more
I could ask for.

00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:55.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHINO] Thank you so much
for saying that.

00:15:55.241 --> 00:15:57.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Shino chuckles]

00:15:57.344 --> 00:16:00.146 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, this such a relief for me.

00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:09.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, your father has
worked too hard.

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:14.332 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's time for him to take
a well-deserved break.

00:16:14.332 --> 00:16:16.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please tell him that
his job is done.

00:16:16.902 --> 00:16:20.606 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tell him that it's all right
to come home now.

00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:22.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll be right here
waiting for him.

00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:26.147 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no reason for him
to suffer anymore.

00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:34.358 position:27% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] Ushio!

00:16:34.358 --> 00:16:36.559 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you find it?

00:16:37.795 --> 00:16:39.463 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, is that your little girl?

00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:42.068 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, her name's Ushio.

00:16:48.943 --> 00:16:51.046 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TOMOYA] Were you searching
for it all this time?

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:52.681 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USHIO] Uh-huh.

00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:54.684 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] I see...

00:17:01.726 --> 00:17:05.931 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ushio, I'm sorry to
have to say this,

00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:08.268 position:24% line:83% align:start
but we may not be
able to find it.

00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:09.703 position:7% line:89% align:start
We've done everything we can.

00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:13.241 position:16% line:83% align:start
All I can do now is buy
you a new one, okay?

00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:18.281 position:33% line:89% align:start
But that...

00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:20.451 position:13% line:89% align:start
But that was the only one.

00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:23.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, there was a whole bunch
of them at the store.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:26.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that's the one
you picked out.

00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:29.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's the robot you bought me.

00:17:31.198 --> 00:17:34.869 position:13% line:83% align:start
That was the first time...
Daddy.

00:17:40.443 --> 00:17:42.912 position:7% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] Ushio... [USHIO] Hm?

00:17:42.912 --> 00:17:45.149 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOMOYA]
You've been lonely, huh?

00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:47.084 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USHIO] Uh-huh.

00:17:47.084 --> 00:17:50.722 position:10% line:77% align:start
[TOMOYA] Did you have a fun
trip, even though you were with
a mean guy like me?

00:17:50.722 --> 00:17:52.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USHIO] Uh-huh.

00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:55.396 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] I see...

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:58.466 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ushio, can I...

00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:01.303 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is it okay if I stay with you?

00:18:01.303 --> 00:18:02.805 position:35% line:89% align:start
I know...

00:18:02.805 --> 00:18:06.543 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know that I've been a bad
daddy for a long time.

00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:10.748 position:7% line:83% align:start
But from now on, I wanna work
hard to take care of you, Ushio.

00:18:10.748 --> 00:18:15.288 position:10% line:83% align:start
So even if it's tough, is it
okay if I stay with you?

00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:16.556 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:18.225 position:21% line:89% align:start
You really mean it?

00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:20.294 position:21% line:89% align:start
I want you to stay.

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:23.398 position:21% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA] Thank you.

00:18:23.398 --> 00:18:28.071 position:5% line:77% align:start
[USHIO] But... but I'm still sad
'cause I lost something I can't
get back.

00:18:30.107 --> 00:18:32.277 position:41% line:89% align:start
Daddy?

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:34.079 position:41% line:89% align:start
Umm...

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:37.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
[quiet sniffles]

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:40.220 position:35% line:89% align:start
I don't...

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't have to hold it
in anymore, right?

00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:46.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just like you said on the train?
Right?

00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:48.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
'Cause Sanae, she...

00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:53.938 position:5% line:77% align:start
She told me the only times I can
cry are when I'm in the
bathroom, or...

or when I'm in Daddy's arms.

00:19:20.638 --> 00:19:22.774 position:7% line:89% align:start
[TOMOYA sobbing] I'm sorry...

00:19:23.842 --> 00:19:25.845 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:19:27.248 --> 00:19:29.650 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:44.603 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Ushio.

00:19:44.603 --> 00:19:48.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could tell you about
Mommy if you'd like that.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.042 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:19:49.042 --> 00:19:52.046 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay then, come sit over here.

00:20:00.023 --> 00:20:04.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, where do I start...

00:20:04.028 --> 00:20:08.634 position:7% line:77% align:start
Back in high school, Mommy was
having a tough time, so she
cried a lot.

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
That was back when we first met.

00:20:10.504 --> 00:20:12.806 position:19% line:83% align:start
She didn't believe in
herself very much.

00:20:12.806 --> 00:20:16.579 position:7% line:77% align:start
I remember she was standing at
the bottom of the hill at our
high school.

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:19.848 position:10% line:77% align:start
And do you know what she did
while she was standing there
that morning?

00:20:19.848 --> 00:20:23.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
She closed her eyes
and she said "anpan."

00:20:23.153 --> 00:20:25.556 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was a funny habit
Mommy had.

00:20:25.556 --> 00:20:28.627 position:7% line:77% align:start
When she was afraid, she would
say what she wanted to eat out
loud

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it would make
her brave again.

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:34.702 position:5% line:77% align:start
Back then, Sanae was always busy
with work and didn't have time
to make lunch for Mommy.

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:38.406 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course, Mommy would've been
happy if she had Sanae's food,

00:20:38.406 --> 00:20:41.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
and maybe Sanae could make
time if she had to,

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:45.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
but Mommy was too nice
to ask her.

00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:47.751 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what your Mommy was like;
Really sweet.

00:20:47.751 --> 00:20:49.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's see, what else...

00:20:53.292 --> 00:20:55.127 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, she, uh...

00:20:55.127 --> 00:20:57.831 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ah, your mommy...

00:20:59.267 --> 00:21:01.068 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mommy was...

00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:10.848 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.551 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:21:16.489 --> 00:21:18.291 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:21:22.162 --> 00:21:24.866 position:38% line:89% align:start
Daddy...

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:28.003 position:7% line:89% align:start
Silly, why are you crying too?

00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:30.839 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry, it's nothing bad.

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:33.109 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was just thinking of Mommy.

00:21:39.017 --> 00:21:41.921 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, let's get back
to the story.

00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:45.959 position:7% line:77% align:start
Back in high school, Mommy was
really excited about putting on
a play.

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:48.163 position:24% line:83% align:start
Have you ever seen
a play before?

00:23:48.251 --> 00:23:50.721 position:5% line:89% align:start
Finally decided to wake up, huh?

[USHIO] Uh-huh.

00:23:57.563 --> 00:24:00.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sanae told me that it
smells like Mommy.

[TOMOYA] I'm home.
