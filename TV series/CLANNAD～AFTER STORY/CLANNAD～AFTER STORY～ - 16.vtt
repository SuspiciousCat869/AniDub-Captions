00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:14.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
Welcome back. Were you out
there picking up junk again?

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:24.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can tell it's cold
just by touching you.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.559 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry I can't do
anything to help.

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:35.264 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh... are you leaving?

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.636 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, I want you
to stay here with me.

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:46.208 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please... please
don't leave me alone.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:49.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know it's hard,
but I have to go.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.016 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we want to stay together,
it's the only choice.

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:56.186 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please... try to be strong.

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:58.488 position:41% line:83% align:start
["I"]:
I know time is running out.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Tomoya,
do you have everything you need?

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.356 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Yeah, I'm good.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.694 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Let's say goodbye to
Daddy, Ushio.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.097 position:7% line:89% align:start
All right, I'll see you later.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.532 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have a safe day at work.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll see you when you get back!

00:02:57.044 --> 00:03:00.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Sanae stays with
Nagisa during the day.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Old Man stops by a lot, too.

00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:05.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure they're
as nervous as I am,

00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:07.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
but we're doing
everything we can make sure.

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:10.658 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nagisa has a safe delivery.

00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:12.193 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: Good night, Nagisa.
See you tomorrow.

00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:14.862 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Okay,
see you tomorrow, Mom.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.768 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, Sanae... sometimes
I think you must hate me

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:25.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
for what I've done. I sure
wouldn't blame you, at least.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.675 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was just thinking that
if Nagisa hadn't met me

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:29.710 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the first place, she
wouldn't be going through such

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.412 position:10% line:89% align:start
a risky pregnancy right now.

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:33.781 position:16% line:83% align:start
For better or for worse,
I changed her life.

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:36.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: When I first met
her, she seemed so frail.

00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:38.787 position:16% line:83% align:start
I feel like if I hadn't
called out to her that day,

00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:41.056 position:13% line:83% align:start
she would've stood at the
bottom of that hill forever...

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:43.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
she never wouldn't
taken the first step

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.660 position:10% line:89% align:start
into the life she lives now.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.663 position:16% line:83% align:start
I dunno, maybe I'm being
conceited about this.

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:51.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I always felt
that she had gotten stronger

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:52.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
because she met me...

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:56.638 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I had gotten stronger
because of her, too.

00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:58.607 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's exactly
what happened, Tomoya.

00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:00.575 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have no idea
how much Akio and I

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.644 position:19% line:83% align:start
appreciate the things
you've done for Nagisa.

00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:04.412 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's fine and all, but I'm
starting to have my doubts.

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:07.282 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I weren't here, then she'd
probably still be living at home

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:08.583 position:30% line:89% align:start
with you guys.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
She might not have
as many friends,

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:12.922 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I think she'd still
be happy in her own way.

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:14.656 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or maybe she would've met
someone who's actually

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:17.794 position:10% line:83% align:start
worth something... and she'd
be better off than she is now.

00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:21.130 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's hardly fair, Tomoya.
I can't even imagine that.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.166 position:5% line:89% align:start
I had a feeling you'd say that.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's nice of you, but you
don't have to humor me.

00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:27.236 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't know...

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:29.739 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's how I honestly feel.

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:31.707 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry I brought this up.

00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:34.644 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess... I just needed
to vent a little.

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:43.653 position:7% line:83% align:start
["I"]: I kept working@without
a moment of rest.

00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:46.622 position:24% line:83% align:start
I needed a machine
that could fly.

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:49.559 position:10% line:83% align:start
@I needed to build a machine
that could take us away

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.627 position:19% line:89% align:start
from this dying world.

00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:10.047 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Christmas is right
around the corner, huh?

00:05:10.047 --> 00:05:13.151 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and that means it's
about to be your birthday, too.

00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:14.384 position:10% line:89% align:start
What do you want this year?

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:16.854 position:7% line:89% align:start
Another Dango Family plushie.

00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:18.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
I already gave you one of those,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.757 position:24% line:83% align:start
what would you do
with another one?

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.759 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Besides, I don't
think they sell them anymore.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're saying it'd
be hard to get one?

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:26.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: More like impossible.

00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:27.966 position:24% line:89% align:start
"Impossible," huh?

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:39.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: Well, I'll be damned,
I can't believe you found one!

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm lucky Tomoya went
through so much trouble

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:43.014 position:24% line:89% align:start
to get one for me!

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:44.649 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: Now you've
started a tradition!

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:46.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're going to have to buy
one for her every year.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:48.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then you'll really have a
Big Dango Family someday!

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:51.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
I dunno; Her older ones might
get jealous if we do that.

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.726 position:13% line:89% align:start
But it's kind of a shame;

00:05:54.726 --> 00:05:56.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't hold all three
at the same time.

00:05:56.661 --> 00:05:58.496 position:16% line:83% align:start
You think you could you
do it for me, Tomoya;

00:05:58.496 --> 00:05:59.430 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just on your lap.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.332 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Me?

00:06:00.332 --> 00:06:01.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: Who else?

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:04.469 position:30% line:89% align:start
@Here you go.

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, that's perfect!;
You look so cute!

00:06:06.571 --> 00:06:08.107 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:16.048 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: They smell like
Nagisa. That's nice...

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:26.759 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yo! Long time no see!

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.794 position:7% line:89% align:start
Remind me, who are you again?

00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:32.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
That wasn't funny last
April and it's not funny now!

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:34.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hi Sunohara, glad
you could make it!

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, and happy
New Year, by the way.

00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:38.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh! Good to see you Nagisa!

00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:39.406 position:44% line:89% align:start
Eh?

00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:40.807 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara]: WHOA!

00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:42.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow, you're totally huge...!

00:06:42.608 --> 00:06:44.978 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's a little
embarrassing, actually.

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:49.616 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's all like,
magic or something...

00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:51.851 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now that's enough of that!

00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:56.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see you're as crude
and insensitive as ever!

00:06:56.222 --> 00:06:57.757 position:10% line:89% align:start
You move off and get a job,

00:06:57.757 --> 00:06:59.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you still act
the same as always!

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:02.396 position:10% line:77% align:start
@No offense, but that's like
theúpot calling the kettle
black.

00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:03.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Kyou! Fujibayashi!

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.166 position:13% line:89% align:start
Glad you guys could come.

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
@It's like a high school
reunion! Happy New Year!

00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:09.103 position:21% line:89% align:start
@[Kotomi]ÚI'm here!

00:07:09.103 --> 00:07:11.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just made it back
from America.

00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:13.374 position:33% line:89% align:start
How are you?

00:07:13.374 --> 00:07:16.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
I feel like it's been ages
since I've seen any of you guys!

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.814 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're doing great! I'm happy
you could make the trip, Kotomi!

00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:21.315 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:23.583 position:13% line:89% align:start
You sure are big, Nagisa!

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:24.551 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep.

00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:25.753 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can I touch your tummy?

00:07:25.753 --> 00:07:29.056 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course you can!

00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:32.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't know what, but there's
something so wonderful about it.

00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:35.162 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ooh! Me next!

00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:36.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
Would you give
it a rest for once?

00:07:36.964 --> 00:07:38.799 position:38% line:89% align:start
No fair!

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:42.937 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara]:
C'mon! Lemme touch it! Please?!

00:07:42.937 --> 00:07:45.374 position:27% line:83% align:start
@So this card's
fromúTomoyo's family, huh?

00:07:45.374 --> 00:07:48.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it seems like her
brother's doing well, too.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:50.012 position:13% line:89% align:start
This one's from Miyazawa.

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:51.246 position:7% line:89% align:start
Looks like all of her friends

00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:52.914 position:13% line:89% align:start
are finally getting along!

00:07:52.914 --> 00:07:55.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, one last card,
úfrom Nishina and Sugisaka.

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:59.788 position:10% line:77% align:start
@It says We miss you at work
andúhope you have a healthy
baby.

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:02.290 position:30% line:89% align:start
Almost forgot.

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:07.029 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Here you go; Give this to
Meiúwhen you go back home.

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:08.130 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.831 position:19% line:83% align:start
@It's Yoshino'súbrand
new single.

00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:12.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
@He's starting up againúon
an indie record label.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's weird. It's called
Love and Spaniel?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi]: Actually,
I think it's Love and Spanner.

00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:21.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did they really let you
graduate from high school?

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
Still, that's a
strange song title.

00:08:23.446 --> 00:08:26.282 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, Yoshino and I came up
with it one day at work.

00:08:26.282 --> 00:08:29.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
That was actually one of the
better ones, believe it or not.

00:08:31.487 --> 00:08:32.855 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki...

00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:34.323 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's up? What is it?

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:36.826 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kyou]: They're both Okazaki
now, dummy.

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:38.995 position:19% line:89% align:start
Okay... Dude Okazaki.

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:42.398 position:16% line:83% align:start
["Dude Okazaki"]: What?
Just call me Tomoya!

00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:46.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're about to be a dad, right?
How does it feel?

00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:48.604 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's a strange
question to ask.

00:08:48.604 --> 00:08:50.640 position:10% line:89% align:start
Actually, I'm curious, too.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
@What's it like
knowingúthat you're about

00:08:52.376 --> 00:08:54.411 position:13% line:89% align:start
@to start yourúown family?

00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.945 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara]: It's weird.

00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:57.747 position:24% line:83% align:start
I always imagined
me and my friends

00:08:57.747 --> 00:08:59.450 position:7% line:89% align:start
having kids way in the future.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.751 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara]: So when I heard that
you two were gonna be parents,

00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:04.587 position:7% line:83% align:start
it felt like I was supposed to
be an adult all of a sudden...

00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:06.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
or like I missed
the bus on something.

00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:10.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
I dunno... I probably shouldn't
say this in front of you,

00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:13.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I don't think most guys
choose to become a father.

00:09:13.163 --> 00:09:15.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's more like
a natural disaster...

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:17.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
like an earthquake,
or getting hit by lightning.

00:09:17.968 --> 00:09:19.636 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's why I wanted to know
how you feel about it

00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:20.771 position:24% line:89% align:start
happening to you.

00:09:20.771 --> 00:09:22.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's going through your head?

00:09:25.543 --> 00:09:27.911 position:13% line:89% align:start
I dunno. Can't really say!

00:09:27.911 --> 00:09:29.646 position:24% line:89% align:start
@What, that's it?

00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:32.015 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not trying to avoid the
question, it just feels like

00:09:32.015 --> 00:09:33.851 position:10% line:89% align:start
it hasn't quite sunk in yet.

00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:35.819 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was just working my hardest

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:38.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
and living for the woman
I love... then it happened.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.592 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: That's it.

00:09:40.592 --> 00:09:43.862 position:7% line:83% align:start
@[laughing] Y'know, actually,
úthat's a big relief!

00:09:43.862 --> 00:09:46.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
After all this time,
you haven't changed a bit!

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.299 position:30% line:89% align:start
You think so?

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:50.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course. When I heard
you guys were having a baby,

00:09:50.368 --> 00:09:52.370 position:13% line:83% align:start
I felt like you'd totally
drifted away from me.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.639 position:21% line:83% align:start
But no, you're right
where I left you.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm happy to see it.

00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:57.275 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know what you mean.

00:09:57.275 --> 00:09:58.943 position:19% line:83% align:start
To tell you the truth,
I was a little nervous

00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:00.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
about coming to see
you guys today.

00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:02.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
I feel like you two rushed
so far ahead in life

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:04.649 position:10% line:89% align:start
that you left us all behind.

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:06.818 position:30% line:83% align:start
Life really is
mysterious, isn't it?

00:10:06.818 --> 00:10:11.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where does it come from
and where does it go?

00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:13.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
That reminds me of the stuff
I was studying back in America;

00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:16.262 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm trying to continue
my parents' research.

00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:19.697 position:13% line:77% align:start
@It was something about a
hiddenúworld... isn't that
right?

00:10:19.697 --> 00:10:21.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:23.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're studying another world
parallel to ours.

00:10:23.735 --> 00:10:27.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, it's been sort of
difficult to make much progress,

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:29.542 position:21% line:83% align:start
since we can neither
see nor feel it.

00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:32.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
But you know...
we're learning more every day

00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:35.181 position:10% line:83% align:start
and it seems like it's a lot
closer than we thought.

00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:36.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Ryou]: Really?

00:10:36.916 --> 00:10:39.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah. It's probably related
to extra dimensions

00:10:39.486 --> 00:10:41.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
that we haven't discovered yet.

00:10:41.153 --> 00:10:44.156 position:19% line:83% align:start
According to M-theory,
all matter we know of

00:10:44.156 --> 00:10:46.226 position:21% line:83% align:start
consists of a series
of strings that exist

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:48.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
in both our dimension
and higher dimensions.

00:10:48.562 --> 00:10:52.132 position:7% line:83% align:start
That means that these strings
may or may not be visible

00:10:52.132 --> 00:10:53.799 position:13% line:89% align:start
in a 3-dimensional space.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:55.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's also believed
that some forces,

00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:57.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
such as gravitational energy

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.039 position:24% line:83% align:start
can transcend the
four-dimensional space-time.

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:01.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ugh. Whoa, slow down!
Could you dumb that down

00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:02.342 position:21% line:89% align:start
for the rest of us?

00:11:02.342 --> 00:11:04.077 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought I was
already explaining it

00:11:04.077 --> 00:11:05.946 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the dumbest way possible.

00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:08.448 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Anyway... Crazy
science talk aside, the point
here is

00:11:08.448 --> 00:11:10.217 position:30% line:83% align:start
that our world
and the hidden world

00:11:10.217 --> 00:11:11.751 position:27% line:83% align:start
are connected in
some way, right?

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.521 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:15.623 position:13% line:83% align:start
Things like time and space
or even human consciousness

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:18.559 position:13% line:83% align:start
can interact in ways that
change things in both worlds

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:20.461 position:13% line:89% align:start
and create new ones, too.

00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:22.496 position:10% line:83% align:start
So what I mean, is that the
two worlds could be influencing

00:11:22.496 --> 00:11:24.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
each other in ways
that we don't understand yet.

00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:26.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
Does it make more sense now?

00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:29.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Ryou]: So, even if we
can't see the hidden world,

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:30.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's still affecting
our lives in some way?

00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:33.107 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't want
to jump to any conclusions,

00:11:33.107 --> 00:11:35.176 position:33% line:83% align:start
but that's a
definite possibility.

00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:38.212 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kotomi]: After all, this world
is full of things that we don't
understand.

00:11:38.212 --> 00:11:39.547 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wonder what kind of place
the hidden world is?

00:11:39.547 --> 00:11:42.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Is it like our
world, or different?

00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:49.957 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Nagisa's play... why
did I remember that all of a
sudden?

00:11:49.957 --> 00:11:52.260 position:19% line:83% align:start
The girl in the world
that had ended...

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
how did I know that story?
Why was it so familiar...

00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:58.333 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tomoya?

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.469 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh, sorry, I was
lost in thought.

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:02.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
@I was wondering if might
beúpeople in the Hidden World

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.940 position:13% line:83% align:start
@just like us, celebrating
New Year's right now.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.875 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been talking about
one Hidden World,

00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:09.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
but there may be
any number of them.

00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:11.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, there may be
as many worlds

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
as there are possibilities
in our lives.

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:16.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, that's funny. Fujibayashi,
you said something like that

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:18.721 position:7% line:83% align:start
a long time ago when you were
telling our fortunes, right?

00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:21.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
Right. The future isn't
something that's predetermined,

00:12:21.591 --> 00:12:24.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
there are all sorts of
possibilities out there.

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:26.161 position:16% line:89% align:start
I still in believe that.

00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:27.764 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, the possibilities
are endless!

00:12:27.764 --> 00:12:30.098 position:13% line:83% align:start
That means there's a world
out there where one of you

00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:31.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
is going out with me!

00:12:31.701 --> 00:12:34.169 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or maybe a world where I'm
going out with ALL of you!

00:12:34.169 --> 00:12:37.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
No Kyou in any world
would ever go out with you.

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:39.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, no Sunohara would
ever go out with you!

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.020 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's no use. I can't create
things like she can.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.457 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only thing I can do
is pile up junk.

00:12:54.457 --> 00:12:58.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
No matter how hard I tried,
I was completely helpless.

00:12:58.428 --> 00:13:02.965 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then... before I knew it...
I had stopped working.

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:15.011 position:16% line:89% align:start
So you're here too, huh?

00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.447 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Old man...

00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:18.915 position:21% line:83% align:start
This town just keeps
changing and changing.

00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:22.419 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Akio]: But what can I say?
Everything has to change sooner
or later.

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:26.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how people keep
living... keep growing.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.558 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm surprised to
hear you say that;

00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:31.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought this place had
sentimental value to you.

00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:33.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think... if we
stopped this construction,

00:13:33.665 --> 00:13:35.332 position:16% line:89% align:start
Nagisa would get better?

00:13:35.332 --> 00:13:36.768 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:36.768 --> 00:13:38.969 position:27% line:83% align:start
I dunno. I just
had that feeling.

00:13:38.969 --> 00:13:40.672 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're being ridiculous.

00:13:40.672 --> 00:13:42.940 position:13% line:83% align:start
Having a big hospital here
is good for the whole town...

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
it's nothing to complain about.

00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:46.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
And even if we wanna
get sentimental about it,

00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:48.513 position:7% line:89% align:start
it won't make any difference.

00:13:48.513 --> 00:13:51.182 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I know. But I think I'm
gonna end up hating this town...

00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:52.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
It ain't so bad.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.419 position:5% line:89% align:start
If it makes you feel any better,

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:56.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
we asked the construction
company to keep

00:13:56.154 --> 00:13:58.256 position:7% line:89% align:start
a couple of the trees around.

00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:00.658 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just like Tomopyon, right?
At your high school?

00:14:00.658 --> 00:14:04.028 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomo-pyon? Oh, you mean Tomoyo.

00:14:04.028 --> 00:14:07.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
So Nagisa's giving birth
at the hospital, huh?

00:14:07.165 --> 00:14:09.735 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. We just don't want
to take any chances.

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:11.369 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's safer that way.

00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:15.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do everything you can and leave
the rest to fate... right?

00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:17.610 position:10% line:89% align:start
Looks like it's gonna snow.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: The snow came down in
sheets, covering the town.

00:14:26.252 --> 00:14:28.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
Cars and trains
came to a standstill.

00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:32.625 position:10% line:83% align:start
Everything stopped moving...
as if the town was paralyzed

00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:34.126 position:27% line:89% align:start
from an illness.

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:35.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa started running a fever,

00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:38.230 position:30% line:83% align:start
then went into
labor unexpectedly.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was two weeks earlier
than her due date.

00:14:43.969 --> 00:14:45.571 position:10% line:89% align:start
@[Nagisa breathing in pain]

00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:47.908 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're all right, Nagisa!
Hang in there, okay?

00:14:47.908 --> 00:14:49.241 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're gonna make it!

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.416 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...!

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:03.022 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about me.

00:15:03.022 --> 00:15:06.125 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm fine. I have to
look out for Ushio.

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:09.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
@After this is over, the three
of us are gonna live together,

00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:12.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
right here in our home.

00:15:12.732 --> 00:15:14.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right, we were
able to get Yagi!

00:15:14.701 --> 00:15:16.938 position:19% line:83% align:start
Damn it, the cars are
all stuck on the road!

00:15:16.938 --> 00:15:18.840 position:13% line:89% align:start
What the hell?! Why now?!

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.241 position:10% line:83% align:start
Listen Furukawa, I need you
to boil some water for me.

00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:22.877 position:21% line:89% align:start
As much as you can.

00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:24.578 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:15:24.578 --> 00:15:28.448 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okazaki... you do whatever
you can to encourage your wife.

00:15:28.448 --> 00:15:31.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right, it's okay if
I hold her hand, isn't it?

00:15:31.586 --> 00:15:36.223 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course! You just hold on
and don't let go.

00:15:36.223 --> 00:15:42.363 position:10% line:77% align:start
@Nagisa, I'm right here with
you, okay? Don't give up,
Nagisa!

00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:44.932 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: I know you can do it.
It's gonna be fine!

00:15:44.932 --> 00:15:46.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're gonna have Ushio

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
and we're gonna start
our new life together!

00:15:48.402 --> 00:15:51.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Just calm down now,
úit'll be all right.

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:55.243 position:10% line:89% align:start
@[Yagi]ÚOkay. Breathe out.

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:59.514 position:19% line:83% align:start
@[Yagi]ÚThat's right,
@good. Now...

00:16:01.182 --> 00:16:04.385 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just relax. Relax.

00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:07.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're doing fine.
Let's have a look.

00:16:17.098 --> 00:16:20.769 position:19% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Nagisa lost
consciousness over and over
again.

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:24.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
Waking up and passing out
because of the pain.

00:16:24.439 --> 00:16:29.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was cruel to watch. I wanted
to cover my eyes and hide.

00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:38.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
It stretched on and on
with no end in sight.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.425 position:16% line:83% align:start
I lost track of time...
it felt like an eternity.

00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:47.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was so close to
passing out, myself.

00:16:47.162 --> 00:16:51.066 position:7% line:83% align:start
After a while, I felt like my
heart couldn't take it anymore.

00:16:51.066 --> 00:16:53.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
I felt like I had
run out of hope.

00:16:58.775 --> 00:17:01.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
[baby crying]

00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:20.196 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...?

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.333 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...?

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.669 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nagisa... [gasp]

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:34.345 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tomoya...

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:38.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's here! Nagisa!
She's right here!

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.290 position:16% line:89% align:start
You can hear her, right?

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.594 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's our baby;
That's our baby crying!

00:17:50.594 --> 00:17:54.699 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here, look! I got to hold her
before anyone else! See?

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:59.904 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah... She turned out so cute.

00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:04.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is our little baby, Nagisa;
It's our little Ushio.

00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:05.810 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey there, 'Shio...

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a girl! She's as
healthy as can be!

00:18:08.847 --> 00:18:12.984 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah... I'm so glad I could
have her here at home

00:18:12.984 --> 00:18:14.552 position:21% line:89% align:start
with you, Tomoya...

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.522 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry I had to make 'Shio
work so hard for it,

00:18:17.522 --> 00:18:19.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
but at least we
were all together.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:23.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
@You did a great job. I mean it.

00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:28.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey... I'm sorry, but I'm
starting to feel a little tired.

00:18:28.934 --> 00:18:33.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Could you let me rest?
Just for a second...

00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:35.041 position:24% line:89% align:start
@[Sanae]ÚNagisa!

00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.842 position:27% line:83% align:start

The doctor still isn't here?!

00:18:36.842 --> 00:18:39.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Yagi]ÚWe still
can't use the car?!

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:42.048 position:27% line:83% align:start
@Nagisa... Wait,
Nagisa, not yet!

00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:45.718 position:10% line:83% align:start
@Come on, let's talk j-just
a little longer, okay?

00:18:45.718 --> 00:18:48.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't have to say
anything, just listen.

00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:52.558 position:27% line:83% align:start
C'mon, you have
to look at our baby!

00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:55.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
She looks like a cuteúlittle
monkey, doesn't she?

00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:57.496 position:21% line:89% align:start
See? She's so tiny!

00:18:57.496 --> 00:19:00.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here, I'm gonna call
her name now... o-okay?

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:02.368 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ushio...

Hey, it's Daddy. Ushio?

00:19:05.504 --> 00:19:08.441 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is mommy, see?
Look at her, see?

00:19:13.513 --> 00:19:15.515 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's ignoring me.

00:19:15.515 --> 00:19:17.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Guess she
doesn't understand yet.

00:19:20.887 --> 00:19:22.956 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet she'll grow up
before we know it.

00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:24.725 position:10% line:89% align:start
She'll be starting school...

00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll have to go clothes
shopping with her...

00:19:26.993 --> 00:19:30.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll have open house and
school festivals to go to...

00:19:30.131 --> 00:19:31.999 position:10% line:89% align:start
We'll do it all as a family!

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:34.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even though... even though I
used to make fun of that stuff

00:19:34.534 --> 00:19:35.903 position:19% line:89% align:start
when I was growing up.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.478 position:35% line:89% align:start

[gasps]

00:19:47.682 --> 00:19:48.816 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:54.088 position:10% line:89% align:start
Here... it's Ushio's cheek.

00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:56.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on! Hey...

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:11.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Nagisa... You told
me you'd always be by my side.

00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:13.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
You said we'd always
be together...

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
You promised me that, remember?

00:20:16.945 --> 00:20:20.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
Over and over again.
We both promised!

00:20:23.952 --> 00:20:25.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was my only dream.

00:20:25.687 --> 00:20:29.258 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nothing good ever happened
to me until I met you.

00:20:29.258 --> 00:20:31.660 position:7% line:89% align:start
I thought I had a crappy life.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
But even someone useless like me
finally found something

00:20:34.363 --> 00:20:36.131 position:33% line:89% align:start
to live for.

00:20:36.131 --> 00:20:39.269 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right, Nagisa? R-right...?

00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:40.936 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:20:42.037 --> 00:20:43.872 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:21:01.456 --> 00:21:03.126 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Do you like this school?

00:21:03.126 --> 00:21:07.263 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have to say that I love it
very, very much.

00:21:07.263 --> 00:21:09.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
But soon everything changes,

00:21:09.032 --> 00:21:11.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
well at least
it does eventually.

00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:14.103 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fun things, happy things,
they'll all...

00:21:14.103 --> 00:21:18.209 position:7% line:83% align:start
They'll all eventually change
someday you know.

00:21:18.209 --> 00:21:23.646 position:7% line:83% align:start
But do you think you can still
love this place, anyway?

00:21:34.524 --> 00:21:36.861 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
We never should've met.

00:21:36.861 --> 00:21:41.131 position:7% line:83% align:start
We should have just kept going
down our separate paths.

00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:42.967 position:10% line:89% align:start
We never would've gone out.

00:21:42.967 --> 00:21:45.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
We never would've
gotten married.

00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:48.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
And... and Ushio never
would've been born.

00:21:48.873 --> 00:21:51.508 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then... at least, I wouldn't
have to go through

00:21:51.508 --> 00:21:53.510 position:24% line:89% align:start
so much suffering.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.090 position:10% line:89% align:start
We never... should have met.
