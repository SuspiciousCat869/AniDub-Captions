 <i>doing here?</i>

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:20.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>No, I remember... I was</i>
 <i>with her.</i>

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:24.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>We were all alone in this in</i>
 <i>this sad, desolate world...</i>

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:26.321 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>But we were going some place,</i>
 <i>weren't we? We had something</i>
 <i>very important to do...</i>

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:25.855 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>If I had known that this was</i>
 <i>going to happen I wouldn't have</i>
 <i>taken her with me.</i>

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:30.924 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>In the end, all I did was</i>
 <i>make her suffer.</i>

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:35.260 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>That's right. It all</i>
 <i>started when I spoke to her that</i>
 <i>day.</i>

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.728 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Maybe I shouldn't have</i>
 <i>said anything...</i>

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:40.463 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>If she hadn't met me, then</i>
 <i>should wouldn't...</i>

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>I don't want this to be</i>
 <i>the end of our journey.</i>

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:52.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>I don't want to stop now.</i>

00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:55.905 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>Even if there's no hope for</i>
 <i>us, I don't want to accept</i>
 <i>that.</i>

00:02:55.905 --> 00:03:01.340 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>I don't want to let her fall</i>
 <i>asleep in a cold, lonely place</i>
 <i>like this.</i>

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.358 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hey...

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're still there, aren't you?

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>Of course I am. I'll stay</i>
 <i>by your side forever.</i>

00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.198 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thank you... so much.

00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:47.533 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>Huh?</i>

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:50.702 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can hear your voice.
After all this time.

00:03:50.702 --> 00:03:52.068 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>Really?!</i>

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:54.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
I feel my humanity
slipping away.

00:03:54.637 --> 00:03:58.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think that's why I can
finally hear you.

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:01.942 position:7% line:83% align:start
I had a dream just now, lying
in the snow.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:07.011 position:10% line:77% align:start
I found out a lot of things.
Things about you... things about
me...

00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:09.145 position:21% line:89% align:start
Want me to tell you?

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:10.780 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>Mm-hm.</i>

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.181 position:10% line:83% align:start
We were from the same world.
You and I.

00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:17.149 position:13% line:83% align:start
We were very close to each
other long ago.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, actually, we're still close.
Even now.

00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:24.420 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>Wait, then that means we</i>
 <i>don't belong in this world after</i>
 <i>all.</i>

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.921 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>Let's go back together.</i>

00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:32.091 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry... that sounds wonderful
but I have to stay here.

00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:33.993 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>Why?</i>

00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:39.062 position:10% line:77% align:start
Because I'm not just another
part of this world, I'm the
world itself...

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:41.129 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>I don't understand.</i>

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.932 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>You said we'd leave thisworld</i>
 <i>together, didn't you? You</i>
 <i>promised!</i>

00:04:44.932 --> 00:04:49.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I leave this place, then the
entire world will disappear.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:53.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that happens, all the lights
will turn from hope to sorrow.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.204 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>Lights? The lights that are</i>
 <i>floating in the air?</i>

00:04:57.204 --> 00:05:03.342 position:19% line:77% align:start
Yes. Each one of them
representsthe hope of someone in
the other world.

00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:06.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
You were one of those
lights yourself.

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:11.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
The world's so close yet so
far away. Do you remember now?

00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:17.883 position:5% line:77% align:start
We've always been there, youand
I. In the same town. In the same
place.

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:21.952 position:7% line:83% align:start
I see. It's been so long that
you must've forgotten.

00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:24.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Another world... and there's</i>
 <i>another me there?</i>

00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:27.154 position:10% line:89% align:start
You haven't realized it yet?

00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:32.191 position:13% line:77% align:start
Even though you came from
theother world, even though you
exist there now,

00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:37.327 position:5% line:77% align:start
we were able to meet because you
overcame the distance between
our worlds.

00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:40.062 position:13% line:83% align:start
That was more than enough
for me.

00:05:40.062 --> 00:05:44.465 position:7% line:77% align:start
Soon you're going to disappear
from this place and wake up in
the other world.

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:50.201 position:10% line:71% align:start
But don't worry. Onceyou're
there, you'll meet many
wonderful people and experience
many wonderful things...

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:54.570 position:13% line:83% align:start
And finally, you'll see me
again, too.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>We'll meet again? In the</i>
 <i>other world?</i>

00:05:56.804 --> 00:06:00.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just as people's hopes andwishes
appear as lights in this world,

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:04.076 position:7% line:83% align:start
my hopes and wishes appear as
lights in their world.

00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:07.945 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure the other you has
seen them, just as you have.

00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:13.381 position:13% line:71% align:start
Although each light may be
smallin itself, if you gather
enough of them together, then
something truly amazing can

00:06:16.116 --> 00:06:18.984 position:19% line:89% align:start
Something miraculous.

00:06:18.984 --> 00:06:23.219 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>[humming dango song]</i>

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.755 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>Wait. I know that song.</i>

00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:29.623 position:7% line:83% align:start
You should. It's the song you
always sang to me...

00:06:46.332 --> 00:06:49.401 position:10% line:89% align:start
Until we meet again, Daddy.

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:13.514 position:38% line:89% align:start
NAGISA!

00:07:21.184 --> 00:07:22.585 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:07:25.854 --> 00:07:28.522 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, I'm right here! Don't
leave me!

00:07:30.222 --> 00:07:32.357 position:19% line:89% align:start
You had me worried...

00:07:33.758 --> 00:07:36.927 position:5% line:83% align:start
For a second there, I was afraid
you wouldn't talk to me.

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:38.327 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:40.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
At first you didn't
say anything.

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:42.596 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was starting to think you
might keep walking away.

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:45.065 position:7% line:83% align:start
Like you wished we'd never met
in the first place.

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope that wasn't true though.

00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:54.704 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] Meeting you was the
best thing that ever happened to
me.

00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:58.006 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] You made me so happy.
[Tomoya] Nagisa...

00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:02.741 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] I don't want you to be
lost or afraid or anything like
that.

00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:06.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
From here on out, I know things
might be hard sometimes,

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:10.946 position:5% line:77% align:start
but no matter what, please don't
ever regret the time we spent
together.

00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:13.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is that too much to ask?

00:08:17.348 --> 00:08:19.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
I won't regret a thing.

00:08:24.386 --> 00:08:25.654 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thank you...

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:10.645 position:7% line:77% align:start

Nagisa!

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:56.704 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is something wrong, Tomoya?
You look upset.

00:09:56.704 --> 00:10:00.439 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're really... we're
really together now, right?

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:06.210 position:7% line:77% align:start
Of course we are. We'll always
be together. Just like we
promised, over and over again.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.309 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not going anywhere.

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:09.677 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right. Just like we said.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.546 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Yagi] Okazaki...

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:16.314 position:7% line:77% align:start
You don't need to worry about
the health of the baby or the
mother.

00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:18.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
Good job! Congratulations!

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:22.185 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Congratulations to
you too.

00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:23.619 position:30% line:89% align:start

[Sanae] Tomoya...

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.623 position:13% line:83% align:start
How would you like to give
little Ushio her first bath?

00:10:30.523 --> 00:10:33.458 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh... sure!

00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:36.260 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yagi] Support her head with
your right hand.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.561 position:7% line:83% align:start
Cover her ears, so she doesn't
get any water in them.

00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:42.396 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's right, nice and slow.

00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:44.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
Doesn't that feel good, Ushio?

00:10:44.664 --> 00:10:49.299 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now don't dip her head in, just
yet. You need to wipe her down
with gauze first.

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:54.569 position:7% line:77% align:start
There you go. Daddy's getting

[Nagisa] Good job, Tomoya.
You did great.

00:10:57.238 --> 00:10:59.705 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look at that! As healthy as
can be!

00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:03.008 position:10% line:83% align:start

she's as strong as she is now.

00:11:03.008 --> 00:11:04.842 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] She will be.

00:11:04.842 --> 00:11:08.911 position:5% line:83% align:start
She'll have a strong body and a
strong mind, too. Don't worry!

00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:10.378 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

@[♪♪]

00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:26.220 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Don't be so upset.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.288 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Fuko is very upset.

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:32.423 position:5% line:77% align:start
That guy was so rude. I'm not a
grade schooler. I'm a grown
lady!

00:16:32.423 --> 00:16:36.792 position:5% line:77% align:start
Grown lady or not, you're still
short. You can't blame him for
making an honest mistake.

00:16:36.792 --> 00:16:41.494 position:7% line:77% align:start
I may be short, but my mature
personality should've made it
clear to him!

00:16:41.494 --> 00:16:46.298 position:10% line:77% align:start
Fu-chan, I don't think your
personality is as mature as you
think it is.

00:16:46.298 --> 00:16:49.966 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those words sting. Like an icy
dagger through my heart.

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:53.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fuko is traumatized now. Fuko is
damanged goods!

00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:56.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't say strange things
like that.

00:16:56.437 --> 00:16:58.138 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're not Fuko's mom!

00:16:58.138 --> 00:17:00.339 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah, maybe that's it.

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.007 position:10% line:83% align:start
People probably think you're
a grade-schooler

00:17:02.007 --> 00:17:04.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
because you call yourself "Fuko"
like that all the time.

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:09.011 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then what should Fuko call
herself? "This girl"? Maybe.

00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:14.513 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, this girl is grown up in
more ways than one. Like that?

00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:16.348 position:30% line:89% align:start
That so dirty!

00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:19.816 position:7% line:77% align:start
You really shouldn't complain
when you're the one who said it,
not me.

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:22.751 position:19% line:83% align:start
You call yourself "I"
sometimes, so just go with that.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.020 position:24% line:89% align:start
"I", huh? I guess.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:30.288 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen up boys, I'm grown up in
more ways than one. Like that?

00:17:30.288 --> 00:17:31.922 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's so dirty!

00:17:31.922 --> 00:17:33.491 position:13% line:89% align:start
I hate to break it to you,

00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:35.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
but that's going to sound
dirty no matter how you said it.

00:17:35.392 --> 00:17:37.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whatever. Fuko's getting hungry.

00:17:37.726 --> 00:17:39.927 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Given up already, huh?

00:17:39.927 --> 00:17:42.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] I want to go to a
family restaurant.

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:45.197 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Okay. We'll go after
your doctor's appointment.

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:48.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't need a doctor!
There's nothing wrong with me!

00:17:48.565 --> 00:17:50.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's settled! Let's go to
eat now!

00:17:50.533 --> 00:17:52.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Not so fast!
[Fuko] But we have to go fast

00:17:52.868 --> 00:17:54.869 position:16% line:83% align:start
or they're going to run
out of hamburger steak!

00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:57.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it. I'm
sure they have plenty.

00:17:57.704 --> 00:18:03.041 position:13% line:71% align:start
What if everyone in town's
beeneating hamburger steak three
times a day?! Then what'll I
do?!

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:06.976 position:7% line:83% align:start
Trust me, I don't think that's
going to be an issue.

00:18:06.976 --> 00:18:09.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Come on,
we're almost at the hospital.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.246 position:10% line:77% align:start
If they run out of hamburger
steak, I'll make you some
myself.

00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:15.380 position:7% line:83% align:start
But will you put it on a metal
plate so it doesn't get cold?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.014 position:7% line:89% align:start
Of course, anything you want.

00:18:17.014 --> 00:18:19.949 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then I guess I have no choice...

00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:23.252 position:13% line:77% align:start
I know you don't feel like
anything's wrong, but just to
make sure,

00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:25.919 position:13% line:83% align:start
you have to have a little
check-up every now and then.

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:32.257 position:5% line:77% align:start
Please, just humor me. I'll feel
a lot better if I know that
you're healthy. Okay?

00:18:32.257 --> 00:18:34.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't know I was making
you worry so much.

00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:40.194 position:10% line:83% align:start
Huh? Nothing for you to get
upset about.

00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:43.263 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can dissect Fuko if
it'll make you feel better!

00:18:43.263 --> 00:18:44.897 position:30% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan! Stop!

00:18:44.897 --> 00:18:50.500 position:5% line:77% align:start
Come on! You're walking like an
old lady. Let's get a move on
already!

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.101 position:7% line:89% align:start
Quite the handful aren't you?

00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:01.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now what's gotten into
you, Fu-chan?

00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:03.407 position:24% line:89% align:start
I smell something.

00:19:03.407 --> 00:19:04.974 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hamburger steaks?

00:19:04.974 --> 00:19:07.242 position:13% line:83% align:start
You ruined it! That's not
what you're supposed to say!

00:19:07.242 --> 00:19:10.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were trying to tell a joke.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.578 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's not a joke.

00:19:12.578 --> 00:19:13.979 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right. Now I'm going
to say it again

00:19:13.979 --> 00:19:15.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
and this time you ask
me what I smell.

00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:17.215 position:33% line:89% align:start
Okay, okay.

00:19:17.215 --> 00:19:19.149 position:24% line:89% align:start
I smell something!

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:20.316 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you smell?

00:19:20.316 --> 00:19:22.784 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thank you for asking,
dear sister.

00:19:22.784 --> 00:19:24.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think this smell is a
cute smell!

00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:27.153 position:7% line:83% align:start
Okay, but that doesn't answer
my question.

00:19:27.153 --> 00:19:29.655 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was hoping you could catch
my meaning.

00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:30.922 position:38% line:89% align:start
Meaning?

00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:33.090 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't you get it? This is art.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're talking nonsense
again, Fu-chan.

00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you even know what
you're saying?

00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:39.194 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess since you were
a school teacher,

00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:41.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
you have a tough time
thinking outside the box.

00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:44.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sure I was a teacher. Do you
know what I taught?

00:19:44.564 --> 00:19:46.298 position:21% line:89% align:start
Art. Like you said.

00:19:46.298 --> 00:19:49.332 position:13% line:83% align:start
In that case, try to get a
grasp of what I'm saying.

00:19:49.332 --> 00:19:51.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think there's
anything to grasp.

00:19:51.468 --> 00:19:53.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hmm you think so?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case, let me try to put
it in simpler terms.

00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:58.270 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll start over and you ask me
what I smell again.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.538 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay. Got it.

00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:00.805 position:24% line:89% align:start
Someone is coming!

00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:03.739 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Huh?
[Fuko] Don't say "huh"!

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:05.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought you changed
the scenario!

00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:08.543 position:10% line:83% align:start
Was I supposed to say "what
do you smell" that time too?

00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:10.144 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:20:10.144 --> 00:20:12.278 position:10% line:83% align:start
But that would seem a little
unnatural, don't you think?

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:15.813 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just go with it! I promise I'll
follow you, okay?

00:20:15.813 --> 00:20:17.614 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now take it from the top.

00:20:17.614 --> 00:20:18.715 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Okay.

00:20:18.715 --> 00:20:20.816 position:24% line:89% align:start
Someone is coming!

00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:22.251 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh! What do you smell?

00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:25.619 position:10% line:83% align:start
I see, she probably came to
see Fuko.

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:28.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
You just said that you were
going to follow me, remember?

00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:31.289 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the point here is that
someone came to see me!

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:34.491 position:10% line:77% align:start
You're supposed to act more
surprised in a scenario like
this!

00:20:34.491 --> 00:20:38.693 position:7% line:77% align:start
Dear God, I know my sister is
strange, but I hope she can make
friends...

00:20:38.693 --> 00:20:40.394 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now, from the top!

00:20:40.394 --> 00:20:42.295 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're wish is my command.

00:20:42.295 --> 00:20:43.662 position:24% line:89% align:start
Someone is coming!

00:20:43.662 --> 00:20:45.063 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh! What do you smell?

00:20:45.063 --> 00:20:48.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
I see, she probably came
to see Fuko!

00:20:48.132 --> 00:20:50.533 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh? That's quite the surprise!

00:20:50.533 --> 00:20:52.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mmm. She smells cute.

00:20:52.801 --> 00:20:55.169 position:13% line:83% align:start
This conversation doesn't
make any sense!

00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:57.203 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's sleeping right over there.

00:20:57.203 --> 00:20:59.938 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's waiting for someone to
find her and wake her up.

00:20:59.938 --> 00:21:01.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is my chance...

00:21:01.806 --> 00:21:03.240 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'd better hurry!

00:21:05.542 --> 00:21:07.675 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fu-chan, where are you going?

00:21:07.675 --> 00:21:11.211 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't just stand there, if you
want to see her, come with me!

00:21:11.211 --> 00:21:13.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's under that tree
right there!

00:21:13.412 --> 00:21:14.980 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who's under the tree?

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.516 position:10% line:83% align:start
Fuko doesn't know. But she's
very cute, whoever she is!

00:21:19.516 --> 00:21:23.050 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kouko] Fu-chan... Fu-chan!

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.119 position:7% line:83% align:start
Really. What am I going to do
with her?

00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:40.827 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] Are you there?
It's me, Fuko.

00:21:46.998 --> 00:21:50.933 position:5% line:83% align:start
You probably don't know who I am
since we haven't met before.

00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:53.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's your name?

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:57.970 position:10% line:77% align:start
I bet you and I can be good
friends. Come on let's play
together.

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:01.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is no time to be sleeping.

00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:04.407 position:13% line:83% align:start
After all, the fun is just
getting started!

00:23:44.563 --> 00:23:50.233 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you say so, but it took me a
long time to make friends with
everyone my junior year.

00:23:50.233 --> 00:23:53.368 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you didn't make any new
friends in class, huh?

00:23:53.368 --> 00:23:57.036 position:13% line:77% align:start
I couldn't really talk to
anyone, so it was kind of lonely
I guess.

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:02.772 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Sanae] Just open up a little
and I'm sure you can make plenty
of friends.

00:24:02.772 --> 00:24:04.207 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'll try.

00:24:04.207 --> 00:24:05.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
