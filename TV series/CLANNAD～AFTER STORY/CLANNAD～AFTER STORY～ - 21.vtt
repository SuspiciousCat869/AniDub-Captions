Just like Nagisa.
What can I say?

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:24.923 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Doctor] I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid I don't know what's
causing it.

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:29.966 position:7% line:77% align:start
If Nagisa's condition was any
indication, she could be sick
like this for months.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.138 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I don't get it.

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:36.711 position:16% line:83% align:start
She was so fine just the
other day...

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:43.990 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, I've done all I can...

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:00.351 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Tomoya.

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.225 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're the father this
time around, aren't you?

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:06.629 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course I am.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then like it or not, you're
going to have to man-up.

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:54.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you okay? It keeps
getting colder.

00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:58.253 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>A robot like me can't feel</i>
 <i>the cold.</i>

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:03.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'm sure she's suffering. I'm</i>
 <i>sure her hands are freezing.</i>

00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:08.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Although just like everything</i>
 <i>else, I can't feel them.</i>

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:12.678 position:10% line:83% align:start
Before we know it, the whole
world will be buried in white.

00:03:12.678 --> 00:03:15.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'd better hurry while we
still can.

00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:27.403 position:27% line:89% align:start
[water pouring]

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:29.808 position:33% line:89% align:start
[footsetps]

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:31.276 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is it Sports Day?

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.913 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:37.252 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're not running today, Daddy?

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:40.525 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nope. I'm going to stay right
here with you. All day long.

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:41.995 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is Akki going to run?

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:44.265 position:13% line:89% align:start
Knowing him? Probably so.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:48.372 position:7% line:77% align:start
It'll be pretty tough for the
school to find replacements if
both of the anchors cancel.

00:03:51.344 --> 00:03:55.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
Daddy, I want you to beat Akki.

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:57.989 position:5% line:89% align:start
I told you I'm staying with you.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.825 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wish you could do both.

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:02.663 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're always on Daddy's side,
aren't you?

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:03.665 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:05.903 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well I'm on your side, too.

00:04:05.903 --> 00:04:08.707 position:7% line:83% align:start
So I promise I'll protect you,
no matter what.

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:11.278 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hn.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you sleepy?

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:16.788 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:19.960 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sleep all you want. I'm not
going anywhere.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.595 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:28.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>One week...</i>
 <i>Two weeks...</i>

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:31.013 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>Even a month went by.</i>

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:33.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>But Ushio's fever</i>
 <i>never broke.</i>

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:38.926 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>She could barely even leave</i>

 <i>of the question.</i>

00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:41.297 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm sorry.

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:45.971 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'll be honest, I hate to see
you leave after all the hard
work you've done.

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
But then I can't very well keep
you here at a time like this.

00:04:57.691 --> 00:04:59.728 position:21% line:89% align:start
Must've been tough.

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:05.571 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sanae and the Old Man tried to
talk me out of it.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:09.011 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I want to be there for
Ushio as much as I can.

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:10.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you have any savings?

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:14.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have a little. I just started
a college fund for her.

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:05:16.223 --> 00:05:17.893 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're going to miss you.

00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:22.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
That means a lot. Thanks
for everything.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, take this. Don't lose it.

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.256 position:19% line:89% align:start
You sure this is okay?

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:36.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course not okay.

00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:39.162 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's going to be Hell trying
to do my job without it.

00:05:39.162 --> 00:05:40.765 position:30% line:89% align:start
Then keep it!

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:45.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
How about you give me your
screwdriver to use insead?

00:05:45.173 --> 00:05:48.245 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can return it when you
come back to work.

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:51.250 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll borrow it till Ushio
gets better, okay?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
But after that, you've got
to use it again.

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:17.728 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry. I'll take good
care of it for you.

00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:30.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>There was no point</i>

00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:33.021 position:21% line:83% align:start

 <i>know how to treat her.</i>

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.859 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>But more importantly, she</i>
 <i>wanted to stay at home.</i>

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:38.364 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:41.168 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right, now let's change
your pajamas, Ushio.

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.806 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:47.946 position:7% line:77% align:start
You don't have to get up. Just
lay down and let Daddy take care
of it.

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:51.118 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I can do it by myself.

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:06.379 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it. We all
need help sometimes, okay?

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:07.914 position:41% line:89% align:start

Uh-uh.

00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.761 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't be afraid to ask.

00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.800 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you want a new toy, or candy,
or whatever, I'll buy it for
you.

00:07:42.907 --> 00:07:44.978 position:24% line:89% align:start

grumpy?

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
I still had fun.

00:08:09.286 --> 00:08:12.291 position:24% line:89% align:start

No! I'm telling the truth.

All right. I believe you.

[Tomoya] Hey.

00:10:23.582 --> 00:10:25.419 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:27.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
The people of this town
sacrificed a part of nature

00:10:27.623 --> 00:10:29.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
so they could build
a hospital there.

00:10:29.894 --> 00:10:33.366 position:7% line:77% align:start
If this town is still growing,
what are they going to sacrifice
next?

00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:39.543 position:7% line:83% align:start
They're leveling a hill on the
outskirts of town as we speak.

00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:42.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
They want to build a big
shopping mall out there.

00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:46.121 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio] Should be convenient, so
I'm sure the people here will be
happy.

00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:49.293 position:19% line:89% align:start
I had a weird thought.

00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:50.562 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:53.935 position:10% line:83% align:start
You said you brought Nagisa
here when she was dying?

00:10:53.935 --> 00:10:57.675 position:7% line:77% align:start
Maybe when she got better, she
and the town were bound together
in some way?

00:10:57.675 --> 00:11:01.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now her daughter's bound to
this place too...

00:11:03.818 --> 00:11:05.721 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe this town is in pain?

00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:07.592 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe all this change
is causing it?

00:11:07.592 --> 00:11:11.264 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you think their sickness
could be a reflection of that?

00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:18.276 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] I don't think pain's got
anything to do with it.

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:24.353 position:7% line:77% align:start
Like it or not, this world is
always changing. That's just the
natural order of things.

00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:29.462 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] And if people dyingis
just a part of that change, then
we have to learn to accept that?

00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:33.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's just how it's meant to be?
Is that what you're saying?

00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:38.477 position:5% line:77% align:start
Yeah, but it's a hard lesson to
learn and that's why we keep
building these hospitals.

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:59.413 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Here's to the happiness
of this town and all its people.

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:49.399 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you thirsty?

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:51.836 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you want some water?

00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:04.558 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's cold, so drink it
nice and slow.

00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:07.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you gulp it down, you'll get
a tummy-ache.

00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.447 position:30% line:89% align:start
It feels nice.

00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:18.682 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's good...

00:13:18.682 --> 00:13:20.752 position:38% line:89% align:start
Daddy...

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
I want to go on a trip with you.

00:13:26.763 --> 00:13:30.703 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know, but you have to wait
until you get better, okay?

00:13:30.703 --> 00:13:32.405 position:7% line:89% align:start
So where is it you want to go?

00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:34.476 position:13% line:83% align:start
We could see that field of
flowers again?

00:13:34.476 --> 00:13:39.184 position:7% line:77% align:start
Ah but it'd be cold if we went
north in the winter. Let's go to
the south instead.

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:44.092 position:7% line:77% align:start
I bet we could find some place
warm and fun with lots of fresh
air. Or maybe we could...

00:13:44.092 --> 00:13:46.029 position:16% line:89% align:start
B-but I want to go now.

00:13:48.868 --> 00:13:52.740 position:7% line:83% align:start
As soon as you get better. How
many times have I told you?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.976 position:44% line:89% align:start
I...

00:13:53.976 --> 00:13:57.115 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want to go to the field
of flowers right now...

00:13:57.115 --> 00:13:59.452 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ushio...

00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:02.858 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's got to be now.

00:14:02.858 --> 00:14:05.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
We got to go now.
Just you and me.

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.486 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right then, we can go.

00:14:19.486 --> 00:14:23.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you say we got to go now,
then we got to go.

00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:27.266 position:7% line:83% align:start
But if you start feeling bad,
then you got to let Daddy know.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.702 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:30.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good deal.

00:14:35.513 --> 00:14:38.752 position:7% line:89% align:start
Here, I'll carry you. Come on.

00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can walk on my own.

00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:43.594 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't force yourself.

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:47.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
I want to walk with you, Daddy.

00:14:47.634 --> 00:14:52.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
I see... Then we'll walk
together as far as you can.

00:14:52.243 --> 00:14:53.812 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:57.684 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're off! Let's have lots
of fun this time, all right?

00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:59.889 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Are you okay, Ushio?

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.185 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Yup.

00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:19.055 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Just tell me if you
start feeling bad.

00:15:19.055 --> 00:15:22.962 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll go see the doctor. Don't
worry, it's no trouble at all.

00:15:22.962 --> 00:15:24.031 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Okay.

00:15:46.501 --> 00:15:49.073 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's enough, okay?

00:16:03.398 --> 00:16:04.866 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It's snowing.

00:16:18.323 --> 00:16:21.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you like watching the
snow fall, Ushio?

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:23.032 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:25.469 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you like watching it too?

00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:27.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah... I uh...

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:31.946 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah... Daddy likes it, too.

00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:36.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can you walk, Ushio?
You want to take a break?

00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:38.491 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh.

00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:41.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let's take a cab before the
snow starts getting worse.

00:16:41.562 --> 00:16:43.399 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let me carry you.

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:45.135 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm fine.

00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:37.325 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio!

00:17:51.682 --> 00:17:52.851 position:38% line:89% align:start
Daddy...

00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:55.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm right here. What is it?

00:17:55.323 --> 00:18:01.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did we make it? Are we on
the train yet?

00:18:01.366 --> 00:18:05.172 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah... We made it on
the train.

00:18:05.172 --> 00:18:08.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] It's dark. Is it night?

00:18:08.645 --> 00:18:11.685 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] It sure is.

00:18:11.685 --> 00:18:14.355 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's getting late.

00:18:14.355 --> 00:18:15.723 position:38% line:89% align:start
Daddy...

00:18:15.723 --> 00:18:16.792 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:18.262 position:33% line:89% align:start
I love you.

00:18:18.262 --> 00:18:24.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah... Daddy loves you
too, Ushio. Very much.

00:18:36.493 --> 00:18:37.495 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio?

00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:39.231 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio!

00:18:43.137 --> 00:18:45.108 position:41% line:89% align:start
USHIO!

00:19:04.173 --> 00:19:07.980 position:13% line:89% align:start
No... anything but this...

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.951 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nagisa... Please save Ushio.

00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:14.958 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:19:16.428 --> 00:19:21.236 position:16% line:83% align:start
Someone... Someone help!
Help her!

00:19:23.373 --> 00:19:27.146 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nagisa... [sob]

00:19:58.534 --> 00:20:00.102 position:21% line:89% align:start
