00:00:12.398 --> 00:00:14.668 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right! We're in the same
class again!

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:18.507 position:7% line:83% align:start
Aw I'm stuck with Minoshima?!
Man this really sucks.

00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:26.917 position:19% line:89% align:start
Third year... Class D.

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:28.685 position:24% line:83% align:start
Morning, Furukawa.
How's it going?

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, good morning Kimura.
It's going okay I guess.

00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:35.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a real shame they split us
up this semester.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.529 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't taken a look at
your class yet.

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:41.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
So how does it look? Did you end
up with anyone from last year?

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:43.736 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not really... None of the
girls at least.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:45.371 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's too bad...

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:47.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well I'm sure you'll make
friends in no time.

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:49.409 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're cute, so you don't
have to worry.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.880 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, thanks, but I'm not so
sure about that.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.519 position:13% line:71% align:start
Anyway, I'm sure everyone
willlove you once they get to
know you a little better so
don't be shy, okay?

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the record, I'm in Class A.
I'll see you later!

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:02.391 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh... See you later.

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:11.035 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I wasn't looking.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.636 position:16% line:89% align:start
No problem, it's fine...

00:02:56.125 --> 00:03:00.898 position:10% line:71% align:start
It's the first day of thenew
semester and we're stuck with
this crap already. What's the
deal?

00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:03.701 position:10% line:77% align:start
You got to admit, our ninja
escape ghosts could use some
work.

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:07.204 position:38% line:89% align:start
[rustle]

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.374 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?!

00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:16.282 position:21% line:83% align:start
[groan] This sucks.
I want to go ho-

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:18.018 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh you think this sucks, huh?

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:19.619 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know what really sucks?

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.456 position:7% line:83% align:start
Getting stuck here babysitting
a bunch of goons like you!

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:23.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well whose fault is that?

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you didn't want us to get
in trouble like this,

00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:27.895 position:10% line:83% align:start
then you should've helped us
escape out the window!

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:31.533 position:16% line:77% align:start
It seems that you don't
understand the concept of undue
resentment!

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:36.238 position:10% line:71% align:start
So please let me teach youby
cracking open your skull, and
pounding it into your brain with
this hammer!

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:38.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
Y-you look like you'd
really do it.

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:42.079 position:5% line:77% align:start
Geez, you see this? Now this is
exactly why I didn't want to be
class rep.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.482 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then it's settled. None of us
want to be here, right?

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:48.285 position:7% line:77% align:start
So let's just shut up and keep
hammering so we can go home
already.

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:50.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right smart ass.
What's your name?

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.092 position:7% line:89% align:start
Tomoya Okazaki. What's yours?

00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:55.628 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not telling you my name,
you stupid punk.

00:03:55.628 --> 00:03:57.030 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.633 position:10% line:83% align:start
I told you my name, so tell
me yours!

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nope. I don't want to associate
with people like you.

00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:04.906 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've got quite
the personality.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:08.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well look at that. It seems you
have a good eye for character...

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.347 position:13% line:77% align:start
If you mind your manners,
perhaps I'll let you to speak to
me after all.

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:14.383 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, get back here!

00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:16.318 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch out!

00:04:21.424 --> 00:04:23.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey! Get your grubby hands
off me!

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.598 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's with that attitude?
I saved you, didn't I?!

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.902 position:7% line:89% align:start
But I wasn't worth saving...?

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.846 position:10% line:71% align:start
[Kyou] I'm not exactly sure
Ishould thank you, since you
weren't doing the work by
choice.

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:42.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
But either way, I appreciate
the help.

00:04:42.184 --> 00:04:43.618 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm Kyou Fujibayashi.

00:04:43.618 --> 00:04:45.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're in it together this year.

00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:48.157 position:7% line:83% align:start
So try not to give me too much
trouble from here on out.

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:52.296 position:13% line:77% align:start
Fujibayashi? Isn't there a
Fujibayashi in the class next to
ours?

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:54.131 position:7% line:89% align:start
That would be my twin sister.

00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:57.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
I know it's confusing, so you
can call me Kyou.

00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:59.737 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, see ya.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:02.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
So we're stuck with that weirdo
for the rest of the year?

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:05.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be fair, I bet she's thinking
the same thing.

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:07.279 position:10% line:83% align:start
Anyway, you got anything you
want to do?

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not really. Let's just hang out
in front of the train station.

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:11.952 position:7% line:89% align:start
Beats going to home at least.

00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:13.353 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good point.

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:15.488 position:30% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:05:15.488 --> 00:05:17.191 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm back from school.

00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.626 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, welcome home.

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:21.429 position:13% line:83% align:start
So how was it? Is your new
class okay?

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:24.933 position:13% line:77% align:start
I couldn't really talk to
anyone, so it was kind of lonely
I guess.

00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:28.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
What?! Come on! You got to make
a good first impression!

00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:29.839 position:16% line:89% align:start
Here, like this. Watch.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's going down, bro?
This is your home-dog, Nagisa.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.079 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah I've got a business
proposition for you.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:37.715 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I'm going to need a little
down payment first.

00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:39.751 position:13% line:83% align:start
Arg! Why couldn't you just
do that?!

00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:41.419 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's not really me...

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.854 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not the words that matter.

00:05:42.854 --> 00:05:44.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's the feeling
you put behind them.

00:05:44.824 --> 00:05:47.426 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just bust in there and show
people what you're about!

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:52.232 position:5% line:77% align:start
If you say so, but it took me a
long time to make friends with
everyone my junior year.

00:05:52.232 --> 00:05:54.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
It'll probably take a
while this year, too.

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.738 position:13% line:83% align:start
You just need to find the
right chance.

00:05:56.738 --> 00:05:58.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure everyone else
wants to make friends,

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:01.877 position:10% line:83% align:start
so all you got to do is get
someone to notice you.

00:06:01.877 --> 00:06:04.813 position:7% line:83% align:start
The right chance, huh? I guess
you're right.

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.384 position:7% line:83% align:start
Fine. Looks like I'll have to
teach you my special trick.

00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:08.852 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:10.687 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right. You know how some
kids will slip up...

00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:12.290 position:21% line:83% align:start
and call the teacher
"Mom," without thinking?

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
You got to use that scenario
to your advantage...

00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:17.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
and call your teacher "Ultra
Mom" instead!

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:18.230 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then the rumors will
really start to fly.

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:23.403 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Did you hear that? I think
Furukawa related to Ultraman!"

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:25.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
"I wonder if she can transform."

00:06:25.338 --> 00:06:27.106 position:19% line:89% align:start
"Well let's ask her."

00:06:27.106 --> 00:06:30.377 position:5% line:77% align:start
"Hey, what's up Furukawa? Do you
want to eat lunch with us
today?"

00:06:30.377 --> 00:06:33.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
Some how I don't think it
would work out like that...

00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:36.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then how about Plan B?! Give the
kids one of these!

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:38.520 position:13% line:89% align:start
You mean Mom's crab bread?

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.821 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can use this
as a kind of test.

00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:41.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, like a right
of passage.

00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:45.861 position:10% line:77% align:start
Tell the kids that you'll be
their friend if they're hardcore
enough to eat it!

00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:48.665 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have to admit it's a pretty
steep hurdle...

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:51.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
So that's it? So that's how
it is?

00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:55.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
My bread is nothing but a
right of passage to you?!

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:59.044 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aah no! I love your bread!

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:07.988 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's go over the procedure for
tomorrow's entrance ceremony.

00:07:07.988 --> 00:07:10.825 position:13% line:77% align:start
First, the juniors and the
seniors will take their seats in
the gym.

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:14.296 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then the freshmen will come in
and line up on the sides.

00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:17.532 position:7% line:77% align:start
When the ceremony is over, the
freshmen will have an
orientation.

00:07:17.532 --> 00:07:21.237 position:13% line:77% align:start
While that's going on, the
juniors and seniors will return
to class.

00:07:21.237 --> 00:07:23.706 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, there's something else I
wanted to mention...

00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:26.844 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ultra Mom, I have a question!

00:07:26.844 --> 00:07:29.279 position:7% line:83% align:start
By any chance are you related
to Ultraman?

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.581 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's so cool!

00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:32.917 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please transform for us!

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:38.657 position:7% line:77% align:start
Oh, I called the teacher "Mom"
by mistake, again. I'm such a
ditz sometimes.

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:46.066 position:10% line:77% align:start
[teacher] Try not to be too
aggressive about getting them to
join clubs or committees.

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.970 position:7% line:83% align:start
Also, refrain from holding any
welcoming festivities

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.606 position:10% line:83% align:start
other than those authorized
by the school.

00:07:54.675 --> 00:08:00.183 position:33% line:89% align:start
[footsteps]

00:08:00.183 --> 00:08:01.885 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sleeping again, huh?!

00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:06.290 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wake up, Okazaki. Fifth period
is about to start.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.958 position:41% line:89% align:start
Geez.

00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:14.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now that I get a better look at
him, he's kind of cute...

00:08:14.766 --> 00:08:17.136 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder if he has a girlfriend.

00:08:19.272 --> 00:08:22.276 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, look out!

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:26.213 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey! What's going on?!

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:28.349 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't know!
Why don't you tell me?!

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:31.619 position:5% line:77% align:start
Don't play dumb! You were going
to kill him in his sleep,
weren't you?!

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:36.425 position:13% line:77% align:start
No wait! You were going to
pounce on him! Like sexually
pounce on him!

00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:39.129 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why would I want to do that?!

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:42.299 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't fool me. I saw the way
you were looking at him.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were thinking he was pretty
cute, weren't you?

00:08:45.303 --> 00:08:47.872 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>He may act stupid, but he's</i>
 <i>pretty sharp!</i>

00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:50.007 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I hit you on the head,
you'll forget everything!

00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:51.609 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a joke, right?!

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:53.112 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:55.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was trying to sleep, you know.

00:08:55.582 --> 00:08:57.884 position:38% line:83% align:start
Okazaki!
That was a close one just now!

00:08:57.884 --> 00:09:01.122 position:5% line:77% align:start
If I hadn't of stepped in when I
did, this weirdo would have
sexually-

00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:06.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
That should wipe his memory out
just fine.

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:12.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kimura] Furukawa!

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:16.038 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi Kimura.

00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:17.974 position:10% line:89% align:start
Finally caught up with you.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.077 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're off for the day,
aren't you?

00:09:20.077 --> 00:09:21.579 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:09:21.579 --> 00:09:24.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
By the way, this is a new friend
I met in class today.

00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:28.186 position:5% line:77% align:start
We were about to go downtown and
look at some clothes. You want
to come with us?

00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:30.389 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh? You want to hang out
with me?

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:33.493 position:10% line:77% align:start
Furukawa's a little shy but
she's run once you get to know
her.

00:09:33.493 --> 00:09:34.927 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, let's go.

00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:37.764 position:16% line:83% align:start
But we're supposed to go
straight home after class.

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:40.535 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nobody cares about those
old rules anymore.

00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:42.370 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come on, let's lighten up
and have some fun.

00:09:43.304 --> 00:09:44.872 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:09:47.276 --> 00:09:49.978 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow, that's really cute!

00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:53.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
No kidding! That's a good
look for you, Furukawa!

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:55.451 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm getting nervous, you guys.

00:09:55.451 --> 00:09:58.989 position:7% line:77% align:start
What happens if a teacher sees
us here and gives us detention
or something?

00:09:58.989 --> 00:10:01.258 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it.
Just try this on.

00:10:01.258 --> 00:10:02.860 position:38% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.464 position:13% line:83% align:start
[whispers] Let's pretend a
teacher's here.

00:10:06.464 --> 00:10:09.602 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kimura] Furukawa, bad news!
A teacher just showed up!

00:10:09.602 --> 00:10:10.603 position:44% line:89% align:start
Eep!

00:10:10.603 --> 00:10:11.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kimura] We're running away.

00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:13.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take care of things for us!

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:16.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
No, no wait for me!
Don't do that!

00:10:16.243 --> 00:10:20.648 position:7% line:77% align:start
Oh what should I say?! I mean
I've never been in trouble
before!

00:10:20.648 --> 00:10:22.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I'll go
straight home!

00:10:23.818 --> 00:10:24.953 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:27.223 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just kidding.

00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:29.892 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry about earlier.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.994 position:21% line:83% align:start
After what you said,
I just couldn't resist.

00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:35.865 position:10% line:77% align:start
It's all right. I was pretty
scared for a second there,
though.

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:37.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a real shame Furukawa.

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:39.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're a lot of fun to
hang out with,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
but nobody ever notices because
you're so shy all the time.

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:45.244 position:7% line:77% align:start
Just open up a little and I'm
sure you can make plenty of
friends.

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:47.246 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'll try.

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.381 position:27% line:89% align:start
Anyway, see ya.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.815 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was nice meeting you.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:58.225 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] I had a fun time with
Kimura and her friend on the way
back from school but...

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:00.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you didn't make any new
friends in class, huh?

00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:02.163 position:41% line:89% align:start
No...

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:05.401 position:10% line:77% align:start
You've got like, thirty kids
stuffed into that class of
yours, right?

00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.536 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's bound to be somebody
you can get along with.

00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:09.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remember, a stranger you
pass in the hallway

00:11:09.905 --> 00:11:12.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
could turn out to be
your new best friend.

00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:15.812 position:13% line:77% align:start
Or maybe even your future
husband or the father of your
children or something.

00:11:15.812 --> 00:11:19.550 position:10% line:77% align:start
But if you don't get to know
them, they'll never be anything
more than strangers.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.687 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know, but what do you
think I should do?

00:11:21.687 --> 00:11:23.821 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why don't you try this?!

00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:27.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hidden among these rolls is one
of Sanae's infamous creations.

00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:30.797 position:7% line:77% align:start
Have your classmates pick them
up one at a time like Russian
Roulette!

00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:32.299 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:34.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
People do this kind of thing
at parties all the time!

00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's guaranteed to be a hit
with the kids!

00:11:36.437 --> 00:11:39.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Wow that Furukawa sure is a
lot of fun, isn't she?"

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:42.110 position:19% line:83% align:start
"I know! I hope she'll
be my friend."

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.312 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's what they'll say.

00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:44.447 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gah!

00:11:44.447 --> 00:11:47.685 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh. I understand.
That's how it is, huh?

00:11:47.685 --> 00:11:51.854 position:5% line:83% align:start
My bread is nothing but Russian
Roulette to you?!

00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:55.959 position:27% line:89% align:start
I... luff hhem!

00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:04.337 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] The six of spades, the
eight of hearts, the nine of
spades...

00:12:04.337 --> 00:12:08.841 position:13% line:83% align:start
Six and nine unite to form
number eight, so that means...

00:12:08.841 --> 00:12:13.046 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] I don't know about
accurate, but your fortune
telling certainly is unique.

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:16.585 position:10% line:77% align:start
Look Kyou! It says someone's
going to confess his love to
you!

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:18.787 position:41% line:89% align:start
To me?

00:12:18.787 --> 00:12:24.761 position:10% line:77% align:start
That's right! Tomorrow, your
Prince Charming is going to
reveal his feelings at last.

00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:30.568 position:19% line:71% align:start
[Sunohara] There's no
turningback now. This is war and
if we want to win, we have to
show her how scary we can be.

00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:33.003 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know if I want to
beat up a girl.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sunohara] No! Fight with words!

00:12:35.507 --> 00:12:38.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] "To my beloved Kyou
Fujibayashi."

00:12:38.377 --> 00:12:42.115 position:10% line:77% align:start
"I fell in love with you at
first sight, and would like to
confess my love for you."

00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:45.385 position:7% line:77% align:start
"Come to the reference room in
the old school building during
lunch time."

00:12:45.385 --> 00:12:47.721 position:27% line:89% align:start
"See you there."

00:12:47.721 --> 00:12:50.924 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'm going to sneak it into her
shoe locker first thing
tomorrow.

00:12:50.924 --> 00:12:55.130 position:13% line:77% align:start
Then we're can hide in the
shadows and watch while she
reads it and freaks out.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.768 position:10% line:77% align:start
If I got a love letter this
stupid, I'd cry myself to sleep
at night.

00:12:58.768 --> 00:13:02.238 position:5% line:77% align:start
It's going to mess with her head
so much, she'll forget all about
us!

00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:05.909 position:5% line:77% align:start
Then we'll be able to reak havoc
all we want for the rest of the
year!

00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:10.581 position:5% line:77% align:start
They say love is a battlefield,
but I have a feeling this plan
of yours is going to bomb.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.516 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just you wait.

00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:15.119 position:10% line:83% align:start
Poor little Kyou won't know
hit her!

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.696 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Ryou] I have to set things up
for the welcoming ceremony, so
I'm going to go on ahead.

00:13:23.696 --> 00:13:25.699 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay. I'll see you later then.

00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:30.639 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:31.907 --> 00:13:35.645 position:21% line:83% align:start
"To my beloved Kyou
Fujibayashi."

00:13:35.645 --> 00:13:38.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
No way! Just like the
fortune said!

00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:45.122 position:7% line:83% align:start
How cute! Guess she has a soft
side after all.

00:13:45.122 --> 00:13:48.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
For the record, I think this is
absolutely awful.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, what about him over there?
Do you think he's cute?

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:57.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I say yes, we'll have to
fight over him, won't we?

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder how many people
will join our club.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.908 position:7% line:83% align:start
[student] We need at least two
more to get approved.

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:03.744 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's ask that guy!

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:06.280 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] Good morning everyone.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.351 position:7% line:71% align:start
[girl] Hey, check out thatguy
down there with the big round
head. Doesn't he look like those
things?

00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:15.424 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know, they were realpopular,
there were a whole bunch of them
and they had that song...

00:14:15.424 --> 00:14:17.092 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shoot, what were they called?

00:14:18.194 --> 00:14:20.263 position:21% line:89% align:start
It looked like this.

00:14:20.263 --> 00:14:23.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, it's on the tip of
my tongue. I can't remember.

00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:26.838 position:10% line:77% align:start
Yeah, they were all over the
place. They had a whole bunch of
stuffed toys, right?

00:14:26.838 --> 00:14:28.640 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh uh... I know.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.711 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right, it's time for the
welcoming ceremony. Let's go.

00:14:41.522 --> 00:14:45.326 position:7% line:77% align:start
[principal] I want to extend a
heartfelt welcome to all the
freshmen joining us today.

00:14:45.326 --> 00:14:49.565 position:5% line:77% align:start
I sincerely hope that the years
you spend at the school will be
memorable ones.

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:54.303 position:21% line:83% align:start
[woman] Next, is our
freshman introduction...

00:15:08.152 --> 00:15:12.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Oh no... Am I actually</i>
 <i>looking forward to this?</i>

00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:33.649 position:7% line:83% align:start
"I've run into some problems,
so please come to the roof."

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:46.599 position:7% line:77% align:start
"Sorry. I think we should meet
in the gym equipment storage
room."

00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:50.436 position:16% line:89% align:start
What the heck is this?!

00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:55.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
Okay, we've had our fun.
Let's just give it a rest.

00:15:55.842 --> 00:15:57.477 position:19% line:89% align:start
No way. This is gold.

00:15:57.477 --> 00:16:00.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've got to milk it for
all it's worth, man.

00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:04.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
Say "Ultra Mom..." Just say
"Ultra Mom..."

00:16:11.828 --> 00:16:13.097 position:21% line:89% align:start
Can you believe it?

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.231 position:10% line:83% align:start
She still hasn't figured out
that this is a joke.

00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:18.837 position:7% line:77% align:start
This is going too far. I think
she's really about to lose her
mind.

00:16:18.837 --> 00:16:20.471 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm just getting started!

00:16:20.471 --> 00:16:23.208 position:7% line:89% align:start
Got to hurry... Got to hurry!

00:16:27.913 --> 00:16:30.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I'm serious. Make this
the last one.

00:16:30.349 --> 00:16:32.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay, okay. Let's see...

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:36.490 position:10% line:83% align:start
"I've run into some problems
again, so this time..."

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
I didn't think this far ahead...

00:16:38.191 --> 00:16:42.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] How about, "I'll see you
in Hell"? [Tomoya] Hell, huh?

00:16:42.296 --> 00:16:46.535 position:10% line:77% align:start
Ooh, now that's a nice idea!
We'll end the big chase with a
scary cliff hanger!

00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:49.673 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's great! I'm so glad you
like my idea!

00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:52.442 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:16:56.914 --> 00:16:59.685 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought I really was
going to Hell...

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.488 position:13% line:77% align:start
Remind me again why are we
making a big stupid ball out of
sticks?

00:17:03.488 --> 00:17:07.994 position:5% line:77% align:start
Because I'm having a bad day now
and I want to vent all my
frustration on the freshmen...

00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.629 position:21% line:89% align:start
Vicious cycle, huh?

00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:14.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
What should I write on the
message inside?

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:19.141 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, I know! How about, "Sunohara
and Okazaki, the Chummy Duo. By
Wazzup"?

00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:23.479 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'm going to write "Wazzup" in
like, ancient Japanese script so
we can look all hardcore.

00:17:23.479 --> 00:17:26.415 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response. Just give
it up.

00:17:26.415 --> 00:17:30.721 position:10% line:77% align:start
Okay, how about, "Youhei and
Tomoya: Going for the gold! By
Wazzup"?

00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:32.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
You've really lost me on this
whole "Wazzup" thing.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.659 position:33% line:89% align:start
How about...

00:17:34.659 --> 00:17:37.863 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Sunohara and Okazaki, the
European Extreme Ironing Duo,

00:17:37.863 --> 00:17:42.168 position:16% line:77% align:start
featuring the Hikarisaka
Brothers in Dinosaur Armageddon.
By Wazzup."

00:17:42.168 --> 00:17:44.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I didn't know ideas
could get that bad.

00:17:44.637 --> 00:17:47.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fine, then you write something!

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.877 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] The banner's going to
fall out when this thing breaks
open, right?

00:17:49.877 --> 00:17:55.249 position:13% line:71% align:start
[Sunohara] Yeah. We got to
letthe freshman know high school
is going to be a living Hell for
them.

00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:59.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
In that case, I guess this all
I can say.

00:18:04.127 --> 00:18:05.561 position:7% line:89% align:start
[girl] What the heck is that?

00:18:05.561 --> 00:18:07.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
[guy 1] Whatever it is, it sure
looks suspicious.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.433 position:16% line:83% align:start
[guy 2] Pull it and see
what happens.

00:18:09.433 --> 00:18:12.436 position:13% line:77% align:start
[guy 3] No way! I bet the
water's going to fall out of
something like that.

00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:16.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
Looks like nobody's falling
for it.

00:18:16.274 --> 00:18:19.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well yeah, did you really think
anyone was that dumb?

00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:22.983 position:7% line:77% align:start
Damn it. So does that mean all
these stupid ass freshmen are
smarter than me?

00:18:22.983 --> 00:18:25.786 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think there's
anyone stupider than you.

00:18:26.753 --> 00:18:27.854 position:41% line:89% align:start
Look!

00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:33.628 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Is she a freshman?

00:18:33.628 --> 00:18:36.965 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Sunohara] Her emblem is blue.
She's a senior.

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:17.413 position:38% line:89% align:start
[clang]

00:19:24.654 --> 00:19:26.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh man! She's got knocked out!

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.960 position:7% line:89% align:start
Get her to the nurse's office!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Okazaki...

00:19:30.695 --> 00:19:33.098 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe you're not the dumbest
after all.

00:19:38.503 --> 00:19:40.773 position:16% line:89% align:start
Furukawa, are you okay?

00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:46.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think so. My head hurts and
I'm a little confused.

00:19:46.314 --> 00:19:49.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
Someone was trying to pull
a prank on the freshmen.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was watching to see if anyone
would fall for it.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.156 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't believe it! That was
just like a comedy show-

00:19:54.156 --> 00:19:55.758 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh! I'm sorry.

00:19:55.758 --> 00:19:57.827 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, it's okay.
I don't mind at all.

00:19:57.827 --> 00:20:01.865 position:7% line:77% align:start
Actually, it's kind of funny.
I've been meaning to talk to you
since yesterday.

00:20:01.865 --> 00:20:06.604 position:10% line:71% align:start
Kimura said you didn't have
anyfriends in class but you were
really nice and fun to hang out
with.

00:20:06.604 --> 00:20:09.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
She said that about me?

00:20:09.807 --> 00:20:12.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess this is a stange way to
meet someone, huh?

00:20:12.443 --> 00:20:16.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, since we're in the same
class, why don't we be friends?

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:19.486 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure. But I... I'm not...

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:29.131 position:5% line:77% align:start
Nevermind. Thanks for helping me
out after I hurt my head back
there.

00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:31.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm just glad I was there
to see it.

00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:42.746 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou] If teaching kindergarten
is this tiring, maybe I should
find a new career.

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:44.416 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did something bad happen?

00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:48.119 position:5% line:83% align:start
No. There's a couple of trouble
makers in my class, that's all.

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:50.323 position:10% line:83% align:start
Those idiots had me running
all over the place.

00:20:50.323 --> 00:20:53.693 position:19% line:77% align:start
It sounds like you're
complaining but you don't look
like you mind.

00:20:53.693 --> 00:20:58.332 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh, well, I don't really mind.

00:20:58.332 --> 00:21:01.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not to change the subject,
but did your boobs get bigger?

00:21:06.574 --> 00:21:07.977 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:21:07.977 --> 00:21:10.145 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right. What are you up
to this time?

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:14.217 position:10% line:77% align:start
It's Operation Love Letter,
Round Two! The last one was just
a warm up.

00:21:14.217 --> 00:21:19.056 position:5% line:71% align:start
This time, I've got a wholestory
planned out about some freshman
who'd fall in love with her at
first sight.

00:21:20.992 --> 00:21:23.929 position:10% line:83% align:start
You have a lot of free time.
Too much.

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:26.598 position:41% line:89% align:start
[meow]

00:21:26.598 --> 00:21:30.336 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa] It was my first time
talking to her, so I was a
little nervous.

00:21:30.336 --> 00:21:33.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
But she was really nice and
she seemed like lots of fun too.

00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:35.876 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's great. I was worried.

00:21:35.876 --> 00:21:38.946 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's funny. But I owe it all
to this little banner.

00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:41.149 position:7% line:83% align:start
That came out of the big ball
when you pulled the string?

00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:44.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. I thought it'd be
nice to keep it as a memento.

00:21:44.453 --> 00:21:49.025 position:16% line:71% align:start
If it wasn't for this, I
don'tknow if I ever would have
found the courage to talk make
friends at school.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Don't give in to the hardships
ahead of you..."

00:21:55.999 --> 00:22:00.838 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're name's too hard for me to
read, but I'm glad you were
there to cheer me on.
