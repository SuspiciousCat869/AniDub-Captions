00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.797 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: So, you're married...
but when's the wedding?

00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:06.900 position:10% line:89% align:start
When I save up enough money.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
@Heh! Why couldn't you
marryúlike a doctor or a lawyer,

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:10.671 position:19% line:89% align:start
@instead of some hobo?

00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:12.775 position:7% line:89% align:start
Because I love him, of course.

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.779 position:19% line:77% align:start
@Don't be so serious.
You'llúmake your poor dad
depressed.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, that reminds me,
I should start calling you

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:19.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
dad from now on, too.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:20.952 position:10% line:89% align:start
@No way! That's disgusting!

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:22.522 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, it only makes sense,
I mean, you really are

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.890 position:24% line:89% align:start
my father-in-law.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ain't that right?
Dear old dad...

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.097 position:35% line:89% align:start
[retching]

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:31.468 position:10% line:83% align:start
Fine! If you wanna play that
game, then I'll call you son!

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:32.835 position:24% line:89% align:start
How's that, son?!

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.639 position:30% line:83% align:start
[pained yell]
Stop it, Dad, it hurts!

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:42.582 position:35% line:89% align:start
Son! Dad!

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:19.182 position:41% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:21.319 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wh-What's wrong?

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not quite sure what to
say at a time like this...

00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:26.559 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? A time like what?
What do you mean?

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.062 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Our new life
together starts today.

00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:32.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
Should I say... Ready, set,
go! Or something like that?

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:35.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: No, that's weird. It's
not like a race or anything.

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:37.574 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya chuckles]

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:40.311 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Hmm... You're right.
Then what should we say?

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:44.149 position:24% line:83% align:start
The idea is, we're
gonna live together

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
and support each
other and all...

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.323 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: So, something
like, let's give it our best?

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
In that case, I'd like
to make a vow,

00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.698 position:21% line:83% align:start
to start things off
on a good note.

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:55.432 position:41% line:89% align:start
A vow?

00:02:55.432 --> 00:02:57.101 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep.

00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:00.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
I, Nagisa Okazaki,
will no longer cry.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.975 position:7% line:83% align:start
No matter how hard things get,
I vow to hang in there

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:05.012 position:24% line:89% align:start
and never give up.

00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:07.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
But... even if I don't
cry when I'm sad,

00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:10.319 position:7% line:89% align:start
I might do it when I'm happy.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.922 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's just the kind
of person I am.

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:17.162 position:19% line:83% align:start
From now on, I'll try
my best to support you.

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:20.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you, and I'll try my best
to support you too, Nagisa.

00:03:39.627 --> 00:03:40.860 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Tomoya?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ah! Wh-What is it?

00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:44.299 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Is it really okay
for me to take a bath first?

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.269 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't want to
keep you waiting...

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, it's fine! I, uh,
I'll take a bath first tomorrow

00:03:49.873 --> 00:03:51.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then we'll be
even, all right?

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.011 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Okay! That sounds fair.

00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:55.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
In that case, I'll
see you when I get out!

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:06.764 position:10% line:83% align:start
Calm down! Come on, Tomoya,
you've heard her taking a bath

00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:08.332 position:7% line:83% align:start
at her house plenty of times!
It's no big deal!

00:04:08.332 --> 00:04:09.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
[water turns on]
[Nagisa screams]

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.869 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?!

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.273 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: I'm sorry! I didn't
know the water would be so cold!

00:04:14.273 --> 00:04:16.677 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:18.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
It takes a while for
the water to get hot,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.115 position:7% line:89% align:start
but it'll be fine in a minute.

00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
Turn the faucet a
little at a time, okay?

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:24.287 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Right. Got it!,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.995 position:7% line:83% align:start
@Umm... sorry for the trouble.
I'll try to be quick.

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:32.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, it's fine. Please,
take your time.

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:34.502 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
No way! I can't do that!

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:36.671 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have to get up early
tomorrow for work,

00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:38.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
so you need to get to bed soon!

00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:41.110 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Huh?

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh... you're right.
Guess I forgot.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:49.689 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: I should
probably get to bed, too.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to startúlooking
for a job tomorrow.

00:04:53.528 --> 00:04:55.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
@I can't just stay at home
and fool around all day

00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:58.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
while you're working!
I have to earn my keep!

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:08.315 position:16% line:89% align:start
Nagisa... are you awake?

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:10.618 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yep. I'm still awake.

00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:13.689 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you serious about
looking for a job tomorrow?

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yep. But don't worry,
even if I'm not a housewife,

00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:18.563 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll still cook and clean.

00:05:18.563 --> 00:05:21.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to. Cause this is
my house too, right?

00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:25.906 position:10% line:83% align:start
In that case, I'll take care
of some housework, myself.

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:28.576 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't work too hard
and make yourself sick again.

00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:32.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know I may not be very strong,
but I don't want to live

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.185 position:21% line:83% align:start
the rest of my life
like I'm weak, either.

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:42.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Tomoya. I don't know,
maybe I'm just being selfish.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, I don't think that at all.

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:47.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've never asked
for anything from me

00:05:47.502 --> 00:05:49.238 position:7% line:89% align:start
that I wasn't willing to give.

00:05:49.238 --> 00:05:50.874 position:19% line:83% align:start
But that's the thing,
even if you don't mind,

00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:53.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm always asking you
to do things for me.

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:58.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but who cares?
You ask me to do easy stuff

00:05:58.183 --> 00:06:01.220 position:7% line:83% align:start
like play ball with your dad,
or hold your hand or whatever.

00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:09.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then would you hold my hand now?

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:22.484 --> 00:06:27.558 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is it. It's so sudden,
but... we're married now.

00:06:27.558 --> 00:06:30.762 position:7% line:83% align:start
From now on, everything we do,
we do together, right?

00:06:30.762 --> 00:06:32.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that being said,
I'm sure we'll have

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.066 position:10% line:89% align:start
our fair share of troubles.

00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:37.705 position:10% line:83% align:start
As long as I have you, I can
handle anything, no problem.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:40.642 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, same here; You took the
words right out of my mouth.

00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:43.646 position:7% line:83% align:start
With your support, I feel like
anything is possible.

00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:47.284 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need you. You gotta
stay with me forever, okay?

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.788 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course I'll stay.

00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:53.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Forever... wherever...
I'll always be with you.

00:06:56.664 --> 00:07:00.836 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: And thus, Nagisa and
I began our new life together.

00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:04.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
From now on, I have to work hard
to support the both of us.

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:08.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
But it doesn't feel like
a burden... it's a joy.

00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:11.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
It gives me a reason
to try even harder.

00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:17.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
After work, I go straight
home... as quickly as I can.

00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:21.197 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because it's the home where
Nagisa is waiting for me...

00:07:21.197 --> 00:07:23.433 position:19% line:89% align:start
Because it's our home.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:47.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Oh, by the way,
I gave Nishina a call earlier.

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.237 position:19% line:83% align:start
I got her number back
at my graduation ceremony,

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:51.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
but never got around
to calling her.

00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:54.044 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: She's studying to
get into college now, right?

00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:56.613 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Yup. She's trying
to get into a music school.

00:07:56.613 --> 00:07:58.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
She doesn't want
to burden her parents

00:07:58.683 --> 00:08:00.886 position:7% line:83% align:start
with a bunch of tuition fees,
so she got a part-time job

00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:03.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
to help cover the bills
if she gets accepted.

00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:05.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Really? Good for her.

00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:07.494 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: It's nothing fancy,
but she's gonna work at

00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:10.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
a family restaurant
that's opening next month.

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:13.170 position:7% line:83% align:start
I told her that I was looking
for a job, too and she said

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.604 position:10% line:89% align:start
that I should work with her.

00:08:14.604 --> 00:08:17.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
At the restaurant?
Yeah. As a waitress.

00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:18.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's actually a
big relief for me,

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:21.181 position:13% line:83% align:start
since I haven't had a lot
of luck looking for jobs.

00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:23.084 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: I guess that's good.

00:08:23.084 --> 00:08:24.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's nice to work with
someone you know, at least.

00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:27.189 position:10% line:83% align:start
But don't tell your old man
and Sanae about it.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:28.925 position:21% line:83% align:start
It'll probably just
stress them out.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: I'm sure
they'll find out anyway...

00:08:37.903 --> 00:08:41.675 position:7% line:83% align:start
You sure look like you're deep
in thought; What's on your mind?

00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:44.679 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, I was just thinking about
something Miyazawa said.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:47.716 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Remember the thing
about the old town legend?

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:50.620 position:7% line:83% align:start
She said that whenever someone
achieves true happiness

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.623 position:16% line:89% align:start
an orb of light appears.

00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:55.194 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course, I don't know
if the legend is true or not,

00:08:55.194 --> 00:08:57.463 position:10% line:83% align:start
but it makes me wonder if we
have one of those orbs of light

00:08:57.463 --> 00:08:59.867 position:7% line:89% align:start
hovering around us right now.

00:09:01.368 --> 00:09:04.240 position:5% line:83% align:start
She also said if you can manage
to catch one of those lights,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.608 position:10% line:89% align:start
you'll have a wish granted.

00:09:05.608 --> 00:09:07.343 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you got one...
what would you wish?

00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:10.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
I dunno; I don't need anything.

00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:12.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
There must be something.

00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:14.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, there's nothing
I can think of at least.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:15.755 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
Actually, there might
be one thing.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.828 position:13% line:89% align:start
Really?! What is it, then?

00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:21.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you tell me,
then I'll buy it for you!

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:24.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think I want a baby...

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:25.068 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.405 position:21% line:83% align:start
You think that could
ever happen...?

00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:40.455 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: What's up?

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.592 position:30% line:89% align:start
C'mon in! Ugh.

00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:44.895 position:7% line:89% align:start
I thought you were a customer.

00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:47.098 position:7% line:77% align:start
@I finished work early today,
soúl thought I'd pop in and say
hi.

00:09:47.098 --> 00:09:50.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
Looks like you aren't too
happy to see me, though.

00:09:50.636 --> 00:09:53.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hm? Hmph. No, I wouldn't
say that at all.

00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:55.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why in fact, it's
just the opposite;

00:09:55.977 --> 00:09:59.049 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been dreaming, plotting,
waiting for this day to come!

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.418 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't want to know, do I?

00:10:01.418 --> 00:10:03.821 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's go spy on
Nagisa at her work!

00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:06.024 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:10:06.024 --> 00:10:08.061 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why am I getting
dragged into this...?

00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:10.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
Obviously, because it's
not cool for a man my age

00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:12.499 position:10% line:89% align:start
to go to a family restaurant

00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:14.202 position:24% line:83% align:start
and eat chocolate
parfaits by himself!

00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:17.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who cares? And why does it
have to be a chocolate parfait?

00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:19.076 position:35% line:89% align:start
C'mon kid!

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.012 position:7% line:83% align:start
You've never been to Nagisa's
restaurant before, right?

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:22.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now you can't tell me
you don't wanna see her

00:10:22.714 --> 00:10:24.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
in her waitress outfit!

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:27.988 position:41% line:89% align:start
I do!

00:10:27.988 --> 00:10:29.824 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good man!

00:10:29.824 --> 00:10:31.894 position:7% line:83% align:start
But if word ever got out that
I went to take candid photos

00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:33.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
of her at work, I'd be
the laughingstock

00:10:33.762 --> 00:10:35.598 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the whole neighborhood.

00:10:35.598 --> 00:10:37.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm dressed
as a super-hip youngster

00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:39.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
to disguise myself
as one of your friends!

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.872 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
that's gonna fool anyone.

00:10:40.872 --> 00:10:42.742 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? People who don't
know me will just think

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.745 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm some stylin' rap superstar.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.647 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yo! Yo! I'm MC Akio!

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:48.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rhyming from the bakery
down the street,

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
the baddest baker that
you'll ever meet! Word!

00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:53.056 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:54.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
You realize that rap's
giving yourself away, right?

00:10:54.658 --> 00:10:57.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
Brotha, that's whack,
I better take that rap back!

00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:01.701 position:35% line:83% align:start
[big sigh]
Whatever. Let's just go.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.541 position:24% line:83% align:start
Slow it down, bro!
Wait for Akio!

00:11:18.123 --> 00:11:20.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
Believe it or not,
this whole side of town

00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:21.728 position:10% line:89% align:start
used to be covered in trees.

00:11:21.728 --> 00:11:24.066 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now we got buildings
popping up everywhere.

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:28.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kinda crazy, isn't it? You never
know what's gonna change.

00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:30.874 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey. Something wrong?

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.246 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, no...

00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:37.516 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's go in.

00:11:45.428 --> 00:11:48.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
@Hello, come on
in!úHuh? Is that...

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:50.134 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yo. Long time no see.

00:11:50.134 --> 00:11:53.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, Hi Okazaki,
I haven't seen you in ages!

00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:56.410 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nishina]:
Who is your... friend?,

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.846 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm the rapper without a name!

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:03.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey Rie, the manager's
looking over here.

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:10.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
This way please. Would you
like a table for two?

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.535 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm glad to see they're doing
such good business here.

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:17.873 position:10% line:83% align:start
In a couple of years, I bet
you won't even be able

00:12:17.873 --> 00:12:19.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
to recognize this town.

00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:21.077 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hm? Something wrong?

00:12:21.077 --> 00:12:23.313 position:13% line:83% align:start
You look like you're kinda
down ever since we got here.

00:12:23.313 --> 00:12:26.618 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh... uh... nah, it's nothing.

00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:29.389 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: How can I help you?
Tomoya...

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:31.324 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:12:31.324 --> 00:12:32.993 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:34.962 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did you need to
tell me something?

00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:38.935 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, it's nothing serious,
I just had some time off.

00:12:38.935 --> 00:12:42.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Thought I'd
come pay you a visit.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:45.911 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nishina and Sugisaka said
some friends came to see me.

00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:48.382 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Ah, but I'm afraid
I haven't met you before...

00:12:48.382 --> 00:12:49.083 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yo!

00:12:50.384 --> 00:12:52.020 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can't tell who he is!?

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
How... could I? This is the
first time I've seen him.

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.929 position:16% line:83% align:start
Go ahead and take a look
at the menu, if you like.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.635 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll be back just in a minute.

00:13:05.572 --> 00:13:07.740 position:16% line:83% align:start
I told you she wouldn't
be able to tell!

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.278 position:33% line:89% align:start
[bleak sigh]

00:13:10.278 --> 00:13:12.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, what can I say?
Like father, like daughter...

00:13:12.814 --> 00:13:15.919 position:30% line:83% align:start
Aw. How nice,
you're flattering me.

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:18.456 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, have you two decided
on what you want yet?

00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:21.393 position:10% line:83% align:start
@I'll take a hot coffeeÚthe
"rapper" wants a parfait.

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:22.895 position:24% line:83% align:start
@Whichever one is
biggest, úl guess.

00:13:22.895 --> 00:13:25.832 position:7% line:83% align:start
All right, so that will be...
one hot coffee,

00:13:25.832 --> 00:13:27.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
and a Chocolate and
Strawberry Mix Parfait.

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:29.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
Diamond Special, right?

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:32.675 position:24% line:83% align:start
The waiter will be
with you shortly.

00:13:32.675 --> 00:13:34.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Waiter]: Thank you for waiting.

00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:36.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is too big, yo!
You think I'm a pig, bro?

00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:38.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
Better be frontin'
the bill for this ho'!

00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:41.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
What? You said you wanted
a parfait, didn't you?

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.755 position:21% line:89% align:start
Really?! A Parfait?!

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.026 position:21% line:83% align:start
Does that sound like
something I would want?!

00:13:45.026 --> 00:13:46.661 position:30% line:83% align:start
You said it on
the way here, I swear!

00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:49.231 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Guy]: You see that? I told you,
she's really cute, right?

00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:50.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey. Hear that?

00:13:55.874 --> 00:13:58.411 position:24% line:83% align:start
@As you can tell,
Furukawaúis pretty popular.

00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:00.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Believe it or not,
we haveúquite a few customers

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:02.016 position:10% line:89% align:start
@come here justúto see her.

00:14:02.016 --> 00:14:04.986 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rie, she's not Furukawa
any more, remember?

00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:07.658 position:7% line:89% align:start
@Oh... I supposeúyou're right.

00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:09.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
@She's Nagisa Okazaki, now.

00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:14.166 position:16% line:83% align:start
["Rapper"]: Must be the
magic of the uniform.

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:17.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
She does look pretty cute...
even for her.

00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:19.307 position:41% line:89% align:start
Rie...

00:14:21.075 --> 00:14:23.779 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey Princess, what time do
you get off work today?

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:25.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
How bout you and I
get some dinner?

00:14:25.582 --> 00:14:27.151 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know a great place my treat.

00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:28.919 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah, I don't mean to be rude,

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.256 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I need to go straight
home after work.

00:14:31.256 --> 00:14:32.857 position:35% line:89% align:start
[seething]

00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:35.229 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I'd better
get back to work, now.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.399 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hold on a sec!

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:14:39.334 --> 00:14:40.469 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:14:40.469 --> 00:14:42.372 position:5% line:89% align:start
@Wait, "Let's go?" Hey, hold on!

00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:45.141 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't get worked up.
We won't cause any trouble.

00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:46.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on, come with u-

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.513 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey Bro, long time no see!,

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.349 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's been ages, man!,

00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:53.119 position:13% line:83% align:start
Never thought I'd run into
you in a place like this.

00:14:54.888 --> 00:14:56.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're bothering the
other customers.

00:14:56.824 --> 00:14:59.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you say we
take this outside, huh?

00:15:01.897 --> 00:15:04.235 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, the food sucked, anyway!

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:05.937 position:27% line:89% align:start
Dude, you suck!

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:09.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to
bust some heads.

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Um...

00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:12.647 position:24% line:89% align:start
If you don't mind,

00:15:12.647 --> 00:15:14.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
the manager would like
to have a word with you.

00:15:14.383 --> 00:15:17.019 position:33% line:89% align:start
The manager?

00:15:17.019 --> 00:15:19.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm outta here, man,
hope you got a game plan!

00:15:19.523 --> 00:15:21.626 position:21% line:89% align:start
Word to your mother!

00:15:21.626 --> 00:15:22.893 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:15:25.298 --> 00:15:28.034 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Nagisa.
Guess we overdid it.

00:15:28.034 --> 00:15:31.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh, n-no... I'm happy
you helped me out!

00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:32.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
They were being a real pain.

00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:34.643 position:13% line:83% align:start
But, uh... I hate to think
that you might get

00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:38.048 position:13% line:89% align:start
scolded by the manager...

00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:40.484 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah, it'll be fine.
Don't worry, I won't tell him

00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:42.722 position:16% line:83% align:start
we're married, I'll just
pretend like I'm another

00:15:42.722 --> 00:15:43.623 position:24% line:89% align:start
one of your fans.

00:15:43.623 --> 00:15:45.124 position:19% line:89% align:start
[gasp] Don't do that!

00:15:49.998 --> 00:15:52.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, your wife
is a very hard worker;

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:54.170 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're happy to have
her on board.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.939 position:24% line:89% align:start
He already knows!

00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:58.843 position:21% line:77% align:start
I asked Nishina and
Sugisakaúafter I saw them
talking to you.

00:15:58.843 --> 00:16:00.512 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry if I made you nervous,

00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:02.682 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I thought this would beúa
good opportunity to meet you.

00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:05.486 position:13% line:83% align:start
No, I'M sorry for causing
such a big commotion out there.

00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:07.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not at all. Anyone else
would've done the same thing

00:16:07.823 --> 00:16:09.458 position:13% line:89% align:start
in a situation like that.

00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:11.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
As far as I'm concerned,
you were just sticking up

00:16:11.527 --> 00:16:14.131 position:30% line:89% align:start
for your wife.

00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:16.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
To be honest,
this isn't the first time

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:17.235 position:30% line:83% align:start
something like
that has happened.

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:19.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
But Nagisa is quite tactful;

00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:22.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
She deals with those
situations like a real pro.

00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:25.012 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess she can
handle herself. Huh...

00:16:25.012 --> 00:16:28.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know that her health isn't the
best and this is the first job

00:16:28.283 --> 00:16:30.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
she's had... but she's
tough, she's smart,

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.723 position:16% line:89% align:start
and she's hard-working.

00:16:32.723 --> 00:16:36.194 position:16% line:77% align:start
[Manager]: She's a great
employee... and a wonderful
addition to the team.

00:16:36.194 --> 00:16:38.364 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I must say,
she has a tendency

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
to be a bit hard on herself
whenever she happens

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.969 position:24% line:89% align:start
to make a mistake.

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:43.571 position:10% line:89% align:start
If she ever get's depressed,

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm counting on you to cheer
her up for me, all right?

00:16:45.207 --> 00:16:48.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, sure. It's a
pleasure to meet you,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
I feel like I should've
stopped by sooner.

00:16:50.448 --> 00:16:54.353 position:7% line:83% align:start
My girl-ah, I'm sorry, I mean,
my wife... owes you a lot.

00:16:54.353 --> 00:16:55.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks for taking
good care of her.

00:16:55.722 --> 00:16:57.558 position:13% line:89% align:start
[short chuckle] Thank YOU

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:01.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
for taking such good
care of my waitress.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.767 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Looks like you're
really fitting in at your new
job.

00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:07.938 position:10% line:83% align:start
@Uh-huh! It's hard work, but
itúreminds me of the drama club

00:17:07.938 --> 00:17:09.307 position:7% line:89% align:start
@back when we put on our play.

00:17:09.307 --> 00:17:11.444 position:16% line:83% align:start
You looked great in your
uniform, by the way.

00:17:11.444 --> 00:17:15.215 position:10% line:83% align:start
My rapper friend thought so,
too. He said you were cute.

00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:18.486 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your friend is crazy;
I'm not cute at all!

00:17:18.486 --> 00:17:22.459 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nishina and Sugisaka
are way cuter than me...

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
I just remembered,
Nishina told me something

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.530 position:13% line:89% align:start
interesting the other day.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.266 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:17:28.266 --> 00:17:30.403 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa]: Apparently, the high
school@is putting up a new
building.

00:17:30.403 --> 00:17:32.271 position:7% line:89% align:start
And not like an add-on either,

00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:34.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
they're actually going
to tear down the old one.

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:36.311 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:38.514 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just think, the freshmen who
start two years from now...

00:17:38.514 --> 00:17:41.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
@will get to study in a bright,
shiny new school!

00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:44.322 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't wait to see
what it looks like!

00:17:44.322 --> 00:17:45.624 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's so great about that?

00:17:45.624 --> 00:17:46.558 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?,

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:02.948 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's no good!

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:05.284 position:21% line:89% align:start
[tea kettle whistle]

00:18:09.924 --> 00:18:11.894 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah... I'm sorry.

00:18:11.894 --> 00:18:14.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't understand,
Tomoya; What's wrong?

00:18:14.396 --> 00:18:16.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
I-it's nothing.
Really, just forget it.

00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:19.470 position:13% line:83% align:start
You don't have to pretend
like nothing's wrong.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know what I said,
but if I upset you,

00:18:21.071 --> 00:18:23.141 position:13% line:89% align:start
then I want to apologize.

00:18:23.141 --> 00:18:25.311 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did I do something
to make you mad?

00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:36.394 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not like I was mad
at you... just irritated.

00:18:36.394 --> 00:18:38.095 position:13% line:89% align:start
It doesn't upset you, too?

00:18:38.095 --> 00:18:39.531 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sure, the building may be old,

00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:41.233 position:16% line:83% align:start
but that's where we had
the drama club, right?

00:18:41.233 --> 00:18:44.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
We spent a lot of time together
there; It's full of memories.

00:18:44.471 --> 00:18:47.475 position:7% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Oh yeah. You're right.

00:18:47.475 --> 00:18:49.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now that you mention it,
it feels like a shame

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
to just tear it down like that.

00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:53.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, that's why I got
a little worked up.

00:18:53.483 --> 00:18:54.686 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:18:54.686 --> 00:18:55.954 position:30% line:89% align:start
I dunno why...

00:18:55.954 --> 00:18:58.157 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I'm really high-strung
for some reason today.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, it's fine. I didn't
realize I was touching

00:19:02.863 --> 00:19:06.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
on a sensitive subject.
I didn't mean to upset you.

00:19:06.702 --> 00:19:09.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
No... you didn't
do anything wrong.

00:19:09.138 --> 00:19:10.708 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.590 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't know why
I lost it like that.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's wrong? Why am I
so worried about this?

00:19:31.402 --> 00:19:34.139 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: This town is changing.

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.541 position:10% line:89% align:start
It never bothered me before,

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:37.878 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I'm really starting
to feel it now.

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:41.583 position:7% line:89% align:start
Even we're starting to change.

00:19:41.583 --> 00:19:45.354 position:7% line:83% align:start
@And one day, when everything
is different, I...

00:19:45.354 --> 00:19:48.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
But can you still
love this place, anyway?

00:19:57.672 --> 00:20:02.112 position:16% line:83% align:start
At last! My Nagisa photo
collection is complete!

00:20:02.112 --> 00:20:04.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
@You're nuts, old man,
úwhen did you take all these?

00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:06.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hmph! Let's just say
I ate enough of those

00:20:06.718 --> 00:20:09.655 position:13% line:83% align:start
chocolate diamond whatever
parfaits to kill a man!

00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:10.289 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

00:20:10.289 --> 00:20:11.692 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sure wasn't easy.

00:20:11.692 --> 00:20:13.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sometimes, I crawled
on the floor...

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
other times I hid
in the kitchen,

00:20:15.363 --> 00:20:17.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
or clung from the ceiling
or stood on my head

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:18.835 position:10% line:89% align:start
to get just the right angle.

00:20:18.835 --> 00:20:21.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm surprised they
didn't kick you out.

00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:24.575 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, where did our
little ladies run off to?

00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:26.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wanna show them the
fruits of my labor!

00:20:26.678 --> 00:20:29.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dunno. Nagisa said she
needed to talk to Sanae

00:20:29.348 --> 00:20:31.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
about something important
before we came.

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:33.688 position:13% line:83% align:start
But wait, you mean you're
gonna show them these?!

00:20:33.688 --> 00:20:34.622 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:20:34.622 --> 00:20:36.224 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crash]

00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:37.660 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nagisa, what's wrong?!

00:20:40.765 --> 00:20:42.433 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:45.905 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry guys...
Just a little nauseous...

00:20:45.905 --> 00:20:49.176 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nauseous, huh? What, Are you
pregnant or something?

00:20:49.176 --> 00:20:50.979 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't joke about that!

00:20:52.147 --> 00:20:53.348 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hit a soft spot, huh?

00:20:53.348 --> 00:20:55.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry kid, if you had any balls

00:20:55.384 --> 00:20:57.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
she'd have a bun
in the oven already.

00:20:57.688 --> 00:20:59.958 position:10% line:89% align:start
She does. We just found out.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.160 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Huh?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.661 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm not talking about baking.

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:05.665 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait... you mean...

00:21:05.665 --> 00:21:08.402 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nagisa and Tomoya
are having a child.

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:10.706 position:24% line:89% align:start
Congratulations.,

00:21:10.706 --> 00:21:12.541 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, Sanae, when you say
they've having a child,

00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:14.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
you mean a stork came to
visit them, or they picked it up

00:21:14.377 --> 00:21:16.714 position:7% line:83% align:start
in a cabbage patch or a fairy
godmother granted their wish

00:21:16.714 --> 00:21:18.717 position:30% line:83% align:start
or something?
[panicked breathing]

00:21:18.717 --> 00:21:20.753 position:21% line:83% align:start
N-no, Dad that's not
how it works!

00:21:20.753 --> 00:21:24.525 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tomoya and I are married
now, so we, ah, uhm...

00:21:24.525 --> 00:21:27.997 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Wha-!? Nagisa...
no... don't say it...!

00:21:30.566 --> 00:21:33.537 position:33% line:83% align:start
We have sex
and sex makes babies!

00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:39.779 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: It takes a special
