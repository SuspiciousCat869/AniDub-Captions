Your teacher's coming back
from her vacation today, right?

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.807 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh huh.

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:14.677 position:10% line:83% align:start
Alright then. Guess I better
go introduce myself.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:17.014 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's leave a little bit
early, okay?

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:27.929 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yummy!

00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:31.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] All done!

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:35.173 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ready to hit the road?

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:36.708 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:39.712 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ushio, say goodbye to Mommy
before we leave.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.349 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll see you when I get back.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:46.988 position:33% line:89% align:start
Bye Nagisa.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.938 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, Ushio it's dangerous!

00:00:58.938 --> 00:01:01.373 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Wait for me!

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:02.642 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio!

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.504 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nabe!

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:38.473 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nabe!

00:02:38.473 --> 00:02:39.709 position:38% line:89% align:start
Gou gou!

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] What the heck is that?

00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:45.116 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is Nabe, our class pet.
He's soft!

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.785 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why does it seem familiar?

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:50.090 position:13% line:89% align:start
No way! It couldn't be...

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] You must be Ushio
Okazaki's father.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.131 position:41% line:89% align:start
Y-you!

00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.738 position:10% line:77% align:start
Hello! I'm Kyou Fujibayashi,
your daughter's kindergarten
teacher.

00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:02.941 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr Okazaki.

00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:07.146 position:7% line:83% align:start
Y-yes m'am! A pleasure to meet
you too!

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.255 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:17.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow! I've never seen you
make that face before!

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:18.762 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, don't laugh!

00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:21.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come on. You should've known it
was me when you saw Botan.

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:25.638 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or maybe you've forgotten
me already, Mr Okazaki?

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.908 position:13% line:83% align:start
So that giant thing really
is Botan?

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:29.945 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gou!

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:35.584 position:7% line:77% align:start
Sorry I never told you Ushio,
but your daddy and I used to go
to the same high school.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.823 position:10% line:83% align:start
She was always real violent
and mean.

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:41.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
She used to pick on your
poor Daddy all the time.

00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:44.898 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey! Stop filling your poor
child's head with lies!

00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:48.437 position:7% line:83% align:start
And she was good friends with
your Mommy too.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:49.838 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did she tell you that?

00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:52.375 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh...

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:57.716 position:16% line:71% align:start
Sanae told me this time
wouldcome. I mean, she said
you'd probably take care of
Ushio someday.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:02.222 position:5% line:77% align:start
So until then, she wanted me to
keep everything from the past a
secret.

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:06.194 position:7% line:89% align:start
I see... she really said that?

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.337 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Fate works in mysterious
ways, doesn't it?

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:17.042 position:10% line:77% align:start
I never thought in a million
years I'd end up as your
daughter's teacher.

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:20.113 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's been way too long. Sorry
about that.

00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:25.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know things have
been hard on you...

00:04:25.987 --> 00:04:27.923 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:31.595 position:10% line:77% align:start
All of your old friends are
worried about you. Ryou and
Youhei and Kotomi...

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:38.071 position:5% line:71% align:start
When we all got together forNew
Year's a few months back, we
talked about stopping by your
place to pay you a visit.

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:41.642 position:5% line:83% align:start
But we were afraid you wouldn't
want to see us.

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:43.245 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:49.253 position:7% line:77% align:start
But in the end, it looks like
everything worked out just fine,
am I right?

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.290 position:35% line:89% align:start
I guess...

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.993 position:24% line:89% align:start
How's Ushio doing?

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.895 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Is she getting along
with everyone?

00:04:55.895 --> 00:05:01.669 position:7% line:77% align:start
Yeah. She's a great kid. She's
not cynical like someone else in
her family.

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
She must have taken after
her mother then.

00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:08.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's a lot more active than her
mother, used to be then.

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:12.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] She'll wander off on her
own if I'm not paying attention.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
She really keeps me on my toes.

00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:15.155 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:16.190 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.925 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ah hello! Good morning!

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.727 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did you have a good trip?

00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:22.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] I sure did!
Thanks Takuya!

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:26.904 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'd better get going now. Take
good care of Ushio for me. I'm
counting on you.

00:05:26.904 --> 00:05:29.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let me know if you ever have
any problems.

00:05:29.374 --> 00:05:31.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll do whatever I can to help.

00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:35.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thanks. I'm glad we had this
little chat, Ms. Fujibayashi.

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:39.187 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey Ushio!

00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:41.757 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Your daddy's going to
work now!

00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:47.632 position:16% line:89% align:start
See you, Daddy! Buh-bye!

00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:49.802 position:19% line:89% align:start
Bye. Have a nice day!

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.680 position:5% line:77% align:start
Your daddy sure is a nice guy. I
bet you're happy to live with
him now, aren't you?

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.983 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yup!

00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:03.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] Alright then! Let's
go inside.

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.289 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Okay!

00:06:05.757 --> 00:06:07.393 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Fuko?

00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:11.198 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah. She's been wanting to
visit your place for a while.

00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:14.303 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yusuke] How about this Sunday?
Do you have any plans?

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:18.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
No it's fine if she stops by...
I'm just confused.

00:06:18.175 --> 00:06:21.479 position:7% line:83% align:start
Seems like she really wants to
be friends with Ushio.

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.416 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope you don't mind.
That means a lot.

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:26.519 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yusuke] You know, Fuko just
got out of the hospital.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.089 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's good for her to step out
and do things.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.761 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] I see... So it's kind
of a rehab, huh?

00:06:32.761 --> 00:06:36.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yusuke] Yeah, she's really shy,
especially around strangers.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.036 position:7% line:83% align:start
I haven't seen her so excited
about meeting someone before,

00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:41.706 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I want to make sure we
encourage her when we can.

00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:44.243 position:19% line:89% align:start
It sounds good to me.

00:06:44.243 --> 00:06:47.682 position:5% line:77% align:start
@After all, Ushio and Fukoúseem
to get along pretty@well
already.

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:48.916 position:24% line:89% align:start
@It should be fun.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:52.589 position:10% line:89% align:start
@That's great. Thanks a lot.

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.324 position:21% line:89% align:start
@Oh no, it's fine...

00:06:54.324 --> 00:07:01.867 position:41% line:89% align:start
@[♪♪]

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, Ushio, someone's
coming to see you tomorrow.

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:10.261 position:35% line:89% align:start
To see me?

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:14.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Fuko Ibuki. You
remember her, don't you?

00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:16.603 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah! The weird girl!

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:20.776 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, "The Weird Girl" wants to
come over here and play. Is that
all right?

00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:22.844 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah! I'm happy!

00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:24.414 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're happy, huh?

00:08:24.414 --> 00:08:26.917 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yup. I'm happy!

00:08:31.123 --> 00:08:34.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey Daddy, sing Mommy's song
for me please.

00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:37.666 position:10% line:83% align:start
Again? You really love that
song, don't you?

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:41.337 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah. It's my favorite song.

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:45.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay. But it's late at night so
I got to sing real quiet.

Ahem.

00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:30.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll get straight to the
point, Ushio.

00:10:30.118 --> 00:10:32.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
Be my sister! And run away
with me!

is talking to Ushio and Ushio
only!

00:10:39.365 --> 00:10:43.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now Ushio, let's be honest. You
like Fuko don't you?

00:10:43.036 --> 00:10:45.106 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmmm...

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:45.974 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:10:45.974 --> 00:10:48.511 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did you hear that?

00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:51.382 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I still want to stay with
my Daddy.

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:53.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ha ha! Did you hear that?

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:59.258 position:7% line:83% align:start
She says that now but I'll win
her over by the end of the day!

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:01.563 position:7% line:83% align:start
I brought a gift as a token of
our friendship!

00:11:01.563 --> 00:11:05.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's custom made starfish bread
fresh from the Furukawa bakery!

00:11:05.668 --> 00:11:10.041 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'll eat it for me won't
you, Ushio?

00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:11.877 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah sure.

00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:15.748 position:13% line:77% align:start
Considering your taste in
things, that's actually pretty
cute.

00:11:15.748 --> 00:11:17.550 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well okay, here goes!

00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:23.391 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's yummy!

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:27.598 position:7% line:77% align:start
Cute little Ushio eating cute
little bread is setting a new
record for cuteness!

00:11:27.598 --> 00:11:31.135 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's enough hugging
her, right?!

00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:35.175 position:7% line:77% align:start
Ushio and I are about to have
lunch. You can join us if you
like, Fuko.

00:11:36.877 --> 00:11:39.047 position:10% line:83% align:start
My feelings won't be swayed
by bribery, you know!

00:11:39.047 --> 00:11:41.818 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give it a rest!

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:45.388 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki, I heard that
your wife passed away a while
ago.

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:47.191 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.760 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fuko]
I understand your feelings.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.129 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know I must remind you
of her a lot.

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:53.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now let me tell you something...

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:55.235 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, tell Fuko anything.

00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:57.906 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nagisa was absolutely nothing
like you.

00:11:57.906 --> 00:11:59.742 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's like you're not even from
the same planet.

00:11:59.742 --> 00:12:02.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
Y-you mean your wife was
an alien?

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.848 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're the alien!

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
Fuko is not an alien!

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.353 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just can't get inside that
tiny brain of yours.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:12.593 position:7% line:77% align:start
Rest assured, as an Earthling,
my brain is full of very average
Earthling like thoughts!

00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:16.866 position:7% line:77% align:start
The people in the neighborhood
are often remarking on how I'm a
perfectly average Earthling!

00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:19.402 position:10% line:83% align:start
What kind of a neighbors do
you have?!

00:12:19.402 --> 00:12:21.471 position:13% line:83% align:start
So in conclusion, let's go
home together.

00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:23.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?!

00:12:23.574 --> 00:12:26.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, if the average
Earthling thought like you,

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:29.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
the world would be destroyed in
less than 24 hours, for sure.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.586 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nothing you ever say makes
any sense to me.

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:36.425 position:5% line:71% align:start
If there was a big red buttonin
front of you that you weren't
supposed to push, no matter
what,

00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:37.860 position:16% line:89% align:start
then what would you do?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd push it! But only
when no one was looking.

00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:43.268 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well that's too bad because the
button to launches nuclear
missiles.

00:12:43.268 --> 00:12:46.205 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey! That's not fair! You
tricked me into pushing it!

00:12:46.205 --> 00:12:49.744 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just like I said. The world
would be destroyed in no time.

00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:52.047 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right then! I have a
scenario for you.

00:12:52.047 --> 00:12:54.150 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] If there were a pair
of tights on the ground,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.285 position:13% line:83% align:start
that you weren't supposed
to wear, no matter what,

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:58.488 position:16% line:89% align:start
then what would you do?

00:12:58.488 --> 00:13:00.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] I wouldn't do anything.

00:13:00.058 --> 00:13:01.626 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] You're lying!

00:13:01.626 --> 00:13:03.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't be able
to control yourself!

00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:05.999 position:13% line:89% align:start
You'd HAVE to put them on!

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:08.402 position:19% line:89% align:start
[boom] I'm so awesome!

00:13:12.475 --> 00:13:15.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
You fool! Those tights were
the Apocalypse Tights!

00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:21.921 position:5% line:77% align:start
I know it's a litte late to ask
now, but did you please sleeping
pills in this food?

00:13:21.921 --> 00:13:27.896 position:7% line:71% align:start
Yeah right. What? You thinkl'd
try to knock you out and make a
move on you? Not in a million
years.

00:13:27.896 --> 00:13:34.004 position:5% line:71% align:start
I-I'm flattered to hear thatyou
care for me so much. But I don't
think I can return your
feelings...

00:13:34.004 --> 00:13:35.372 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ug really now!

00:13:35.372 --> 00:13:36.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] You don't have
to hide them, you know.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:37.742 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Hide what?!

00:13:37.742 --> 00:13:39.211 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Your feelings for me!

00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:40.981 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Shut up!

00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:42.549 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know what? Just forget
it! I'm not talking to you!

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:44.351 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, now. Don't be shy.

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:48.290 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Anyway, let's play cards.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.163 position:7% line:77% align:start
So what's your game of choice,
Ushio? Blackjack? Poker maybe?
Gin Rummy?

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:55.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
You realize you're talking to a
five-year old, right?

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:57.837 position:16% line:89% align:start
I didn't think of that.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.772 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm so mature and
sophisticated

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:03.678 position:10% line:83% align:start
that end up suggesting adult
games without realizing it.

00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:06.682 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ushio, are there any games
you can play?

00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:11.122 position:30% line:89% align:start
I know Sevens.

00:14:11.122 --> 00:14:15.327 position:13% line:77% align:start
What an enchanting choice,
Ushio! That's a perfectly
splendid game!

00:14:15.327 --> 00:14:18.798 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sophisticated, huh?

00:14:18.798 --> 00:14:22.137 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hey, Okazaki. You have the ten
of hearts right now, don't you?

00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:25.641 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let's just say I have a whole
handful of cards I could use.

00:14:25.641 --> 00:14:29.280 position:5% line:89% align:start
Alright, Ushio, you're up next.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.716 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Ushio] This one. [Fuko] Thanks
Ushio! That's just the one I
needed!

00:14:31.716 --> 00:14:34.587 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now I'm back in the game and
ready to get my revenge!

00:14:34.587 --> 00:14:36.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
Shoot. And I tried so hard to
block her...

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:42.364 position:13% line:71% align:start
Okazaki's evil scheme has
beenthwarted and Ushio's proven
once and for all that she loves
Fuko best!

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:44.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get over yourself!

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.735 position:27% line:89% align:start
[scheming laugh]

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>If only you were</i>
 <i>still alive...</i>

00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:06.464 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Okazaki... Okazaki!

00:15:06.964 --> 00:15:09.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
O-oh...

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.605 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry, guess it's my turn, huh?

00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:17.445 position:10% line:77% align:start
I'm sorry if this is hard on
you, Okazaki. I don't mean to
bring up memories of your wife.

00:15:17.445 --> 00:15:19.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
I told you, you're nothing
like her.

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:22.019 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then what kind of
person was she?

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:24.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
If she wasn't like me, she
must've been immature, right?

00:15:24.856 --> 00:15:28.427 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know if it's possible to
be less mature than you are.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:32.333 position:7% line:77% align:start
She died when Ushio was born,
right? So she never got to meet
her.

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:35.704 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Yeah, she only knows
what she looks like from
pictures.

00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:39.542 position:7% line:77% align:start
Yeah but I still know lots of
stuff about her because Daddy
told me.

00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:44.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now you've got me curious. What
kind of person was she?

00:15:44.282 --> 00:15:46.484 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's see...

00:15:46.484 --> 00:15:49.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well she was kind of a crybaby.

00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:54.163 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Ushio] But she always did her
best and she worked real hard to
have me.

00:15:55.764 --> 00:15:59.736 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I also know Daddy loved
her very much.

00:16:06.846 --> 00:16:09.717 position:38% line:89% align:start
I uh...

00:16:09.717 --> 00:16:14.323 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I still think about her
sometimes...

00:16:14.323 --> 00:16:17.594 position:7% line:77% align:start
I have a lot of free time, so
you can call me whenever you
like.

00:16:17.594 --> 00:16:19.030 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is ask
and I'll be here.

00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:25.205 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll help you out any way I
can, okay?

00:16:25.205 --> 00:16:27.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to admit, I didn't
expect sympathy from you.

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:29.945 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wasn't trying to
be sympathetic.

00:16:29.945 --> 00:16:32.415 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just want an excuse to play
with Ushio.

00:16:32.415 --> 00:16:34.952 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, of course...

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:37.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fair thee well Okazaki.
Captain Fuko is shipping off!

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.092 position:27% line:83% align:start
A simple goodbye
would've sufficed.

00:16:40.092 --> 00:16:42.295 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now let's make a break for
it, Ushio!

00:16:42.295 --> 00:16:44.097 position:7% line:89% align:start
Woah! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:47.001 position:21% line:89% align:start
You win this round!

00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:49.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
But this battle is far
from over, Okazaki!

00:16:49.872 --> 00:16:53.777 position:7% line:83% align:start
So until next time, try not to
get killed in your sleep.

00:16:53.777 --> 00:16:56.281 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't worry. I'll say hi if I
see on the street.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:59.318 position:10% line:77% align:start
And by the way, I've already
committed Ushio's scent to
memory.

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.621 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I'll be able to track her
down if she's nearby.

00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:02.890 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] What are you,
a bloodhound?

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had fun today, Ushio.
Let's play again, okay?

00:17:06.027 --> 00:17:06.995 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:17:12.336 --> 00:17:13.738 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well. See you later.

00:17:13.738 --> 00:17:15.874 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, buh-bye!

00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:21.215 position:21% line:89% align:start
That wore me out...

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:23.717 position:16% line:89% align:start
Fuko sure is funny, huh?

00:17:23.717 --> 00:17:25.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I can give her that
at least.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:29.359 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come on, let's clean up, take
us a bath and call it a night.

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:30.627 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:17:41.008 --> 00:17:43.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
Doesn't Botan get upset when she
slides on her back?

00:17:43.912 --> 00:17:48.185 position:5% line:77% align:start
Actually, she really enjoys it.
It's kind of like getting a back
massage.

00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:52.657 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey Ushio! You good-for-nothing
daddy is here to take you home.

00:17:55.295 --> 00:17:56.696 position:21% line:89% align:start
I missed you Daddy!

00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:58.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry to make you wait.

00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:00.969 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wow. You're quite the dotting
parent, aren't you?

00:18:00.969 --> 00:18:04.908 position:10% line:77% align:start
What are we going to do with
your daddy, Ushio? He's so
hopeless.

00:18:04.908 --> 00:18:09.248 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh. No way, Daddy's cool.

00:18:09.248 --> 00:18:11.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
At least I know she's got good
taste in men.

00:18:13.953 --> 00:18:18.126 position:5% line:77% align:start
Just so you know, I gave Ushio a
handout about our Sports Day
that's coming up.

00:18:18.126 --> 00:18:19.694 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take a look at it, alright?

00:18:19.694 --> 00:18:21.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Sports Day?
[Kyou] Yeah.

00:18:21.598 --> 00:18:27.038 position:7% line:77% align:start
Parents participate in some of
the events, so you'd better
practice, Daddy.

00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:29.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh yes, I already know all about
Sports Day.

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:33.079 position:21% line:77% align:start
The president of the
neighborhood board just gave us
a heads up.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, so would you mind coming to
cheer us on?

00:18:35.983 --> 00:18:39.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sure. But we might do more
than that...

00:18:39.155 --> 00:18:40.591 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whew.

00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:42.725 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akki!

00:18:42.725 --> 00:18:45.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's up, Ushio? Good to
see you.

00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:46.998 position:7% line:89% align:start
So what's with the track suit?

00:18:46.998 --> 00:18:51.371 position:10% line:77% align:start
Sports Day is coming up so I
figured I'd better start
training, you know?

00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:53.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's going to be a beat
down, kid!

00:18:53.141 --> 00:18:55.411 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think they have
Grandpa Boxing.

00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:57.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
Akio has a reputation as a fast
runner,

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.984 position:5% line:77% align:start
so the school asked if he would
be the anchor for the Teachers'
Team.

00:19:00.984 --> 00:19:04.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
The principal, has a bad
back so he can't do it.

00:19:04.356 --> 00:19:06.426 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you're on the Parents'
Team, right?

00:19:06.426 --> 00:19:08.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is going to be a
grudge match!

00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:10.632 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh I always wanted to see one
of those!

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:12.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's not get carried away.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.403 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't know if I'm running in
the relay in the first place.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.239 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sanae, we got to call
the principal,

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:18.775 position:7% line:83% align:start
make sure Tomoya is the anchor
for the Parents' Team.

00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:20.545 position:27% line:89% align:start
You got it dear.

00:19:20.545 --> 00:19:22.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
You people are sick...

00:19:22.514 --> 00:19:25.485 position:10% line:89% align:start
Daddy. Good luck out there.

00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:31.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right! I'll give it my best!

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.861 position:35% line:89% align:start
Go Daddy!

00:19:34.864 --> 00:19:36.799 position:10% line:89% align:start
What the heck are you doing?

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:40.972 position:10% line:77% align:start
I don't want to look lame in
front of my daughter so I'm
working out.

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.898 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Fuko] Ushio!

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:03.803 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh hi Fuko!

00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:06.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
You like going for walks,
don't you?

00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:08.009 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh huh.

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:09.278 position:19% line:83% align:start
But aren't you afraid
you might get lost

00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:10.946 position:5% line:89% align:start
when you're all alone like this?

00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.649 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get lost?

00:20:12.649 --> 00:20:14.818 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Fuko] You know.
Forgetting which way to go,

00:20:14.818 --> 00:20:17.156 position:30% line:83% align:start
having trouble
finding the right road,

00:20:17.156 --> 00:20:21.194 position:10% line:77% align:start
ending up in a neighborhood
you've never heard seen before,
surrounded by strangers.

00:20:21.194 --> 00:20:22.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
That sort of stuff doesn't
scare you?

00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:24.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] Nope, not at all.

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:27.936 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's amazing. I wish I could
be like that, too.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:32.777 position:5% line:77% align:start
But no matter how brave youare,
it's still dangerous for little
kids to be out walking alone.

00:20:32.777 --> 00:20:36.248 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! Ushio, where are you going?

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:45.994 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is that new hospital,
isn't it?

00:20:47.263 --> 00:20:49.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is this where you like to go
when you walk?

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:51.503 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh huh...

00:20:51.503 --> 00:20:53.071 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why is that?

00:20:53.071 --> 00:20:55.641 position:35% line:89% align:start
I just do.

00:20:55.641 --> 00:20:58.212 position:24% line:89% align:start
You just do, huh?

00:20:58.212 --> 00:21:05.522 position:24% line:89% align:start
[♪Music playing♪]

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.691 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Tomorrow's the day,
isn't it?

00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:34.796 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right! The grudge match
we've all been waiting for!

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:39.635 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:45.510 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ushio, are you looking forward
to the big race?

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.245 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:21:49.014 --> 00:21:51.618 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Ushio?

00:21:51.618 --> 00:21:55.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
I tried to... but I couldn't do
it by myself...

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.525 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on, what's wrong?

00:22:03.067 --> 00:22:05.169 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>She's burning up...</i>

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:47.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] First me...
Then my family...

00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.349 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's like this town is toying
with us.

00:23:51.349 --> 00:23:53.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
It grants us happiness
on a whim.

00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:56.456 position:10% line:83% align:start
And then takes it away just
as quickly.

00:24:01.328 --> 00:24:07.971 position:5% line:77% align:start
Why can't I change anything? Why
can't I grant my daughter her
only wish?

00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:11.142 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nagisa... What should I do?
