["I"]:
We've been working hard
 on a new machine...

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:09.399 position:5% line:89% align:start
 One that can fly in the sky.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're going to use it to
 leave this world far behind.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.607 position:16% line:83% align:start
The world we're going to
  is full of life...

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:19.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
full of warmth and fun.

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:22.613 position:16% line:5% align:start
 But we have to hurry.
Time is short.

00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:26.584 position:5% line:5% align:start
 Winter is approaching fast,
 and when the cold sets in,

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.421 position:5% line:5% align:start
  she won't be able to work
 on things like this.

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:35.026 position:5% line:5% align:start
 That's why we can't rest...

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:39.030 position:16% line:5% align:start
  why we can't stop
 until the very end.

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.265 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Did you have your parent-teacher
conference yet?

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.968 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Nagisa]:
 Yes, but we didn't
talk about much.

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:20.736 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I can't find anything I
 want to study in college...

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.139 position:5% line:83% align:start
  so I think I'm going to start
 looking for a job soon.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.842 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your grades are pretty good,
it seems like a waste.

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:27.444 position:50% line:83% align:start
By the way, what
 are you planning to do

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:29.746 position:61% line:83% align:start
  after you
  graduate, Tomoya?

00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:36.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
Umm... Anyway, you, uh,
want me to buy you something?

00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:38.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like a present
or whatever?

00:02:38.422 --> 00:02:41.925 position:16% line:5% align:start
I'm confused. Does this have
 anything to do with graduating?

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:45.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, not really, I just
felt like giving you a present

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:47.264 position:5% line:83% align:start
all of a sudden,
that's all.

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:51.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, you're trying to
 avoid my question, aren't you?

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.904 position:16% line:83% align:start
 And besides, you can't just
 give someone a present,

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.773 position:50% line:83% align:start
you have to have
a reason for it.

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:58.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want to buy a little something
for the person I'm in love with.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:00.178 position:5% line:83% align:start
That should be a good
enough reason for anyone.

00:03:00.278 --> 00:03:02.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess; but if that was
 the only reason you needed

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:04.082 position:16% line:89% align:start
  to buy someone a present,

00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:06.617 position:50% line:83% align:start
then I'd have to
 buy you one every day.

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:10.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 That doesn't make any sense.

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
By your logic, the only times I
  could give you a present

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.227 position:16% line:83% align:start
 are on your birthday
 and Christmas.

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:18.897 position:5% line:5% align:start
No. In my case you would only
buy me a present once a year.

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:19.965 position:61% line:89% align:start
 Why's that?

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:21.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because my birthday
is on December 24th

00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:23.436 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I don't want
to be greedy.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:26.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
What rotten luck; why'd you have
to born at a time like that?

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:30.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know. Why don't you ask
my parents? It's their fault.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.711 position:72% line:89% align:start
  Fine!

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.914 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
Then how 'bout we go
 on a date instead?

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh? That seems
kind of sudden...

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:41.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
 If I can't give you a present,
then we'll go on a date!

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.623 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Sounds good, right?

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure! That sounds
wonderful!

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:49.796 position:61% line:83% align:start
 Good deal.
 See you later.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah! See you
after class!

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait! You never
answered my question.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're mean, Tomoya.

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:08.849 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Graduation...

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.584 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Sunohara]:
Good morning, Okazaki!

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.353 position:5% line:5% align:start
All that and
a toilet!

00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:13.954 position:61% line:5% align:start
Back on your
 toilet kick, I see.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.191 position:5% line:5% align:start
You're looking awfully glum
this morning, amigo.

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:20.328 position:5% line:5% align:start
Is your honeymoon period with
Nagisa over already?

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:22.397 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Hey, listen. Do you
  know what you're gonna do

00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:24.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
 after you graduate?

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.068 position:5% line:83% align:start
'Course I do! I wouldn't want to
trouble my dear little sister,

00:04:27.168 --> 00:04:29.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
so after some
serious consideration,

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:31.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've come to
the perfect solution!

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:32.107 position:72% line:89% align:start
 Really?

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:35.111 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep! I'm gonna make
money off of my looks!

00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:37.513 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Sunohara]:
I'm gonna be a model.
Get it? A model.

00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:38.680 position:50% line:89% align:start
Oh, obviously...

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.082 position:5% line:5% align:start
I know, right?

00:04:40.182 --> 00:04:41.716 position:5% line:5% align:start
It's like, "Man! why didn't
I think of it sooner?"

00:04:41.817 --> 00:04:43.319 position:5% line:5% align:start
If I hit it off big,

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.454 position:5% line:5% align:start
I might even be able to break
into the entertainment world.

00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:46.590 position:5% line:5% align:start
DUDE!

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.824 position:5% line:5% align:start
This is serious!
I might be famous!

00:04:48.924 --> 00:04:50.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
The kids'll hang
on my every word!

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:52.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll use my power to make
the Sunohara Brigade!

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:55.499 position:27% line:5% align:start
  It must be nice to be
 so young and carefree.

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.137 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah! My future is
so bright, it's blinding!

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:03.806 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Ryou]:
 The cards don't lie!
  You really can be a model!

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.542 position:5% line:5% align:start
Really?! All right!

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:08.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
 You'll hit it off big and break
  into the entertainment world,

00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:10.680 position:38% line:83% align:start
  kids will hang on
your every word,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.083 position:50% line:83% align:start
then you'll form
  the Sunohara Brigade.

00:05:13.183 --> 00:05:17.120 position:5% line:5% align:start
 Good! Okazaki, I'll let you be
second in command of my brigade!

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.590 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Hurry; I might die
of anticipation.

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.225 position:38% line:5% align:start
Mm-hmm!

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:23.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Now that I think about it,
  everyone here is a senior,

00:05:23.494 --> 00:05:24.362 position:27% line:89% align:start
 except for me.

00:05:24.462 --> 00:05:25.729 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have all of you decided

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:27.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
what you're going to do
 after you graduate?

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:29.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I was planning on going
  to nursing school

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
as soon as possible.

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:32.370 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I've wanted to do that
ever since I was little.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
I always wanted to be a
  preschool teacher, myself.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.909 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I'll work on getting
 my teacher's license.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:40.178 position:61% line:89% align:start
As for me...

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:43.482 position:5% line:5% align:start
After I graduate, I'll be moving
to America to go to college.

00:05:43.582 --> 00:05:45.850 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Kotomi]:
I'll probably be
  lonely at first...

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
 and I know I'll miss
  all of you a whole bunch,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
 but I'll try to work
  really hard and come back

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.858 position:16% line:83% align:start
  to visit everyone
  as soon as I can.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
What a shame; that means
we won't be able

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
to hear your high-impact
violin solos anymore.

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:59.364 position:27% line:83% align:start
 If you'd like, I could
  play one right now...

00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:03.369 position:5% line:83% align:start
 No! Stop! For the love of God,
think before you speak!

00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:07.473 position:5% line:5% align:start
I know you meant well Tomoyo,
but putting all of our lives

00:06:07.574 --> 00:06:09.175 position:5% line:5% align:start
at stake isn't
very considerate.

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:12.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I'll try
to do better next time.

00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:15.747 position:27% line:83% align:start
 That's rude; she seemed
perfectly considerate to me.

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:18.184 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, uh, Okazaki,
 what are you gonna do?

00:06:18.284 --> 00:06:19.819 position:38% line:83% align:start
 I hear you haven't
 decided if you want

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% line:83% align:start
to go to college
  or not...

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
 so you're avoiding the guidance
 counselors like the plague.

00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:29.162 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Kyou]:
Come on, Nagisa, you gotta
give Tomoya a little shove

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you expect him
to do anything.

00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:33.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa?

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.436 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Nagisa, what's wrong?

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:40.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Don't worry about me.
I just... feel a little-

00:06:40.374 --> 00:06:41.208 position:72% line:89% align:start
 Nagisa!

  [all gasp]

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:46.046 position:38% line:5% align:start
She's got a fever...

00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:52.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
You sure you shouldn't be
staying with Nagisa right now?

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:54.656 position:38% line:83% align:start
 It's not my choice;
 there's a doctor at her house.

00:06:54.755 --> 00:06:57.758 position:16% line:83% align:start
 It might be awkward talking
about some stuff with me around.

[door knocking]

00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.398 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Sunohara? You've got a
 call from your sister.

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:05.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.403 position:5% line:83% align:start
Want me to
tell her anything?

00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:11.206 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Just that she's welcome to
 come visit whenever she likes.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Oh but don't tell her that
 Nagisa collapsed, okay?

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:17.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:20.416 position:5% line:5% align:start
What do you mean she collapsed?
Don't tell me Furukawa's sick.

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:24.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Kinda. I uh guess you could say
 she's got a weak constitution.

00:07:24.387 --> 00:07:27.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Last time she got sick, she
 missed too many days of school

00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:29.925 position:38% line:83% align:start
and ended up getting
  held back a year.

00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:32.094 position:5% line:5% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:38.901 position:5% line:83% align:start

  up; I was just saying hi.

00:07:56.688 --> 00:07:59.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, okay. I'll
lie back down.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.292 position:38% line:5% align:start
 I'll be back later.

00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:06.998 position:5% line:89% align:start

 You think you might
 be worrying too much?

00:08:13.137 --> 00:08:16.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
 I mean, this has happened a
 lot of times before, right?

00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:18.843 position:38% line:83% align:start
The last time Nagisa
 ended up missing class,

00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:20.646 position:50% line:83% align:start
 you were spaced
 out for weeks.

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:23.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I'm just saying you shouldn't
 get stressed out over nothing.

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:32.491 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Did you come to see
  Kyou again, little buddy?

 thought you were gonna eat her.

00:08:38.597 --> 00:08:41.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
You could've asked me
instead of getting violent!

00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:42.968 position:38% line:5% align:start
 What should we do?

00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:45.204 position:50% line:5% align:start
 Can you go home
by yourself?

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:47.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't speak pig,

00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:48.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it looks like she
wants to stay with you guys.

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:50.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm... She can't.

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:52.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
I need to go to PE
in a few minutes.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why don't YOU

  [Tomoya]:
 Huh? Why me?

00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:57.384 position:38% line:83% align:start
N-no, it'll be okay.
 I'm her owner, too,

00:08:57.484 --> 00:09:00.019 position:50% line:83% align:start
so I should take
  responsibility and...

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:04.224 position:5% line:5% align:start
I don't get it; what,
is she afraid of you?

00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:06.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
One time I tried to give her
  a bath and made the water

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:08.829 position:72% line:83% align:start
a little
bit too hot.

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:11.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
 She got the wrong idea and
thought I cooking her in a stew.

00:09:11.164 --> 00:09:14.000 position:50% line:83% align:start
 So she's hated
 me ever since.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
  And so, there you have it.
She's all yours!

00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:19.640 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Hey! Don't tell me I have
 to take this thing to class!

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.674 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:22.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
Botan, plushie mode!

00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:24.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
 This is but one of
 Botan's seven tricks!

00:09:24.412 --> 00:09:26.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
 When she's like this,
  people will think

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
 you're a plushie enthusiast,
 rather than someone

00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:30.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
 smuggling a boar into class.

00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.627 position:5% line:5% align:start
Have you lost it?
What are you doing?

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.264 position:16% line:83% align:start
 You owe me big time
  for this!

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:45.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll buy you some strawberry
milk tomorrow, okay?

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:46.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the best
you can do?

00:09:46.568 --> 00:09:49.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
 I really am sorry.

00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:50.840 position:38% line:83% align:start
 By the way, if it's
 not a bad time,

00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:53.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
  we were thinking about paying
 Furukawa a little visit

00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:54.510 position:61% line:89% align:start
 right now.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.244 position:27% line:89% align:start
  Oh, sorry.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
Actually, she said that she was
 going to the hospital today.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I see... Tell Nagisa
 we said hello, then.

00:10:01.884 --> 00:10:03.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.321 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, see you
later, then.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:13.129 position:5% line:5% align:start
 Poor guy. I wonder if that took
  his mind off of things a bit.

00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:16.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel so bad. Tomoya looked
really depressed, didn't he?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
 He acts tough, but he's got
 a soft side, too. Trust me.

00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:22.539 position:27% line:5% align:start

A month passed.

00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:35.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
 But Nagisa's condition
didn't improve.

00:10:36.788 --> 00:10:39.924 position:16% line:83% align:start
 One day... when she
 was feeling a bit better...

00:10:40.023 --> 00:10:41.926 position:16% line:83% align:start
  she forced herself
to go to school.

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:46.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
But she only got half way there

Not too bad.

00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:08.119 position:27% line:83% align:start

You'll get bored staying

00:11:12.191 --> 00:11:14.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
 It'll be fine. I don't mind
waiting for now.

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:17.596 position:16% line:83% align:start
 As long as I have something
  to look forward to...

00:11:17.696 --> 00:11:20.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't understand.
What are you waiting for?

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:24.871 position:5% line:83% align:start
The day when I can walk with you
  and hold your hand again.

00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:27.507 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know we see each other all
 the time at home and school...

00:11:27.607 --> 00:11:29.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
  but there aren't many
times when it's just

00:11:29.476 --> 00:11:30.944 position:61% line:83% align:start
 the two of
us together.

00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:32.646 position:50% line:89% align:start
 So I thought...

00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:34.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
  it might be nice to go on
 a date where we could be alone

00:11:34.848 --> 00:11:36.416 position:72% line:83% align:start
and just
 hold hands.

We're alone

 I guess
  you're right.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:18.427 position:5% line:83% align:start

 It was a bittersweet

00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:54.364 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Bit by bit,
 the air became colder,

  [Sanae]:
  She can't take her tests,

00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:13.250 position:5% line:83% align:start

attend enough days to graduate.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.486 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of her teachers say
she should just drop out,

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:17.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
and focus on getting medical
treatment, rather than

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:19.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
getting stressed out
about graduation.

00:13:19.556 --> 00:13:21.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
And of course, we're more
concerned about her health

00:13:21.893 --> 00:13:23.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
than her
academic record...

00:13:23.128 --> 00:13:24.328 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Yeah, but Nagisa-

Don't misunderstand;

00:13:26.163 --> 00:13:28.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want Nagisa to decide
everything on her own.

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
But because it's
her decision,

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:32.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
if she isn't able to
graduate this semester,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.172 position:50% line:83% align:start
 then I want you

00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:38.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Everyone but me, at least.

00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:42.510 position:16% line:83% align:start
Entrance exams, college
 applications, job hunting...

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
  I felt like I was
  just left behind.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.592 position:5% line:5% align:start
Happy birthday, Nagisa!
 Happy birthday, Nagisa!

00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:58.427 position:50% line:83% align:start
 I hope you have
 many more to come.

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:00.829 position:27% line:5% align:start
 Happy Birthday
 and Merry Christmas!

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:03.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sure are cheery, despite
getting turned down cold.

00:15:03.233 --> 00:15:06.102 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Kyou]:
 In case you didn't hear, he
 actually sent an application

00:15:06.202 --> 00:15:07.203 position:16% line:89% align:start
 to a modeling agency.

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:08.570 position:5% line:89% align:start
  I can do whatever I want!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm moving back home next year,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.742 position:5% line:83% align:start
 so I'll just end up getting a
job there, either way!

00:15:16.278 --> 00:15:18.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa.

00:15:18.481 --> 00:15:21.117 position:38% line:83% align:start
  Here, I got you a
 birthday/christmas present.

00:15:21.217 --> 00:15:22.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.989 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a dango!

00:15:31.962 --> 00:15:33.563 position:83% line:89% align:start
 Hm?

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:39.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you so
much, Tomoya.

00:15:46.777 --> 00:15:49.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Thank you, guys for
coming here to visit me.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I know I'm not
  worth much, but...

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:57.022 position:38% line:5% align:start
[Akio]:
  Don't talk about
 yourself like that, Nagisa.

00:15:57.789 --> 00:15:59.057 position:61% line:89% align:start
We love you;

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:01.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
 you're just as important as
 anyone else in this family.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.728 position:50% line:83% align:start
  That's right.
 And not only that,

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:05.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
  you're a wonderful friend
 to all of us, too.

00:16:06.097 --> 00:16:08.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know you think of yourself
 as a burden sometimes,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
but as long as you're happy,
  we're happy, too.

00:16:12.537 --> 00:16:15.707 position:38% line:83% align:start
 So please be happy,
 Nagisa. For us.

00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:20.478 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I'm sorry, you guys.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:23.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay! I'll try my best!

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.451 position:61% line:89% align:start
 Hee hee...

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:32.925 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
It was Christmas Eve...
 Nagisa's birthday.

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
 It was also the day
 when Nagisa decided

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:38.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
 that she was going to repeat
her last year of school.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
 After the New Year,
 fewer seniors

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
  bothered coming to class.

00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:44.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
 I spent my time with Nagisa.

00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:47.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Even though she was small and
 even though she was frail,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
  she always tried her best.

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
 And I wanted to try
 MY best to protect her

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.647 position:16% line:89% align:start
for the rest of my life.

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:05.360 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
Sunohara, what do you say we go
around and break a few windows?

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:07.896 position:27% line:83% align:start
 [Sunohara]:
 You're kidding, right?

00:17:07.996 --> 00:17:10.665 position:27% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 I thought maybe if I did that,
 I could repeat a year.

00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:14.569 position:27% line:77% align:start
 [Sunohara]:
 You wouldn't repeat a year,
 you'd be kicked out of school.

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:16.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
 You're right.

00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:18.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not much point
in that, huh?

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:24.179 position:61% line:77% align:start
 [Koumura]:
 Ah, Okazaki, Sunohara.
 Congratulations on graduating.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.680 position:27% line:5% align:start
 [Sunohara]:
 Thank you.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be retiring
 this year, myself.

00:17:27.482 --> 00:17:29.051 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Although it took me
  a bit longer,

00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:31.887 position:38% line:83% align:start
  you might say I'm
 graduating along with you.

00:17:31.987 --> 00:17:33.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Really, huh?

00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:34.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hate to say it,
but without you around,

00:17:34.957 --> 00:17:36.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm a bit worried about how
things are gonna work out

00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:38.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
for the drama club.

00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:40.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
 If you're worried about
  Nagisa, you shouldn't be.

00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:43.933 position:16% line:83% align:start
 That girl's a lot stronger
 and a lot more reliable

00:17:44.033 --> 00:17:45.368 position:72% line:83% align:start
than you
two rascals.

00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:47.536 position:38% line:83% align:start
By the way, I expect
 a lot from you.

00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:49.672 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Takes a special kind of
student to give me grief

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:51.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
  for four whole years;
 so if nothing else,

00:17:51.774 --> 00:17:53.575 position:38% line:83% align:start
  I know you've got
 a lot of spunk.

00:17:53.676 --> 00:17:55.879 position:27% line:5% align:start
 Thanks for sticking up
 for us all these years.

00:17:55.979 --> 00:17:58.014 position:27% line:5% align:start
 We probably woulda been
expelled a long time ago

00:17:58.114 --> 00:17:59.683 position:27% line:5% align:start
  if it wasn't for you!

00:17:59.783 --> 00:18:02.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know... there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:05.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
When me and Sunohara met each
other in the office that day...

00:18:05.188 --> 00:18:07.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
did you plan that, or was
it just a coincidence?

00:18:07.524 --> 00:18:09.193 position:50% line:83% align:start
Huh? What's that
  supposed to mean?

00:18:09.293 --> 00:18:11.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
  The two of us get
  along really well, right?

00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:13.998 position:5% line:83% align:start
 We were both troublemakers,
 but if we had a good friend

00:18:14.098 --> 00:18:16.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
at school, then maybe we
  wouldn't want to drop out.

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
  Is that why you wanted us
 to meet each other?

00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:21.172 position:27% line:83% align:start
 That's a good question.
  I don't remember.

00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:24.008 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Your memory starts to slip
 when you're my age.

00:18:24.108 --> 00:18:26.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
 At any rate, you're members
 of society, starting tomorrow.

00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:29.747 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Be sure to show up for
  your last homeroom class,

00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:33.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
so you can give a proper
goodbye to your school days.

00:18:38.323 --> 00:18:40.691 position:5% line:5% align:start
Thank you very much, sir.
  Thank you very much, sir.

00:18:43.795 --> 00:18:45.831 position:38% line:83% align:start
 I Really appreciate
 all you've done for me.

00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:48.333 position:5% line:83% align:start
I didn't do anything;
I should be thanking you.

00:18:48.433 --> 00:18:49.901 position:5% line:83% align:start
Speaking of which,
they decided to preserve

00:18:50.002 --> 00:18:53.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
the cherry trees after all. I
really owe you one for that.

00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:54.706 position:61% line:83% align:start
When the new
semester starts,

00:18:54.806 --> 00:18:56.775 position:38% line:83% align:start
  Nagisa will be in
 the same grade as you.

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.610 position:50% line:83% align:start
 Look after her
  for me, okay?

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.912 position:50% line:83% align:start
Give me a break.
  Of course I will!

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:03.916 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope everything works
out for you, Okazaki.

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:05.550 position:5% line:5% align:start
[Kyou]:
Tomoya!

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.120 position:38% line:83% align:start
 We're all going to
 a party right now.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.390 position:38% line:83% align:start
But I guess you have
 someplace else to go, huh?

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
  'Fraid so.

00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:25.105 position:72% line:89% align:start
 Anpan!

00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:28.541 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Ah!

00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:31.211 position:38% line:5% align:start
 This outrageous lie
just came out...

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:01.343 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Dummy! You need to
  stay inside and rest!

00:20:01.444 --> 00:20:03.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Sorry, I couldn't resist.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:06.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
No matter what...
I had to see the last time

00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:07.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
you wore your uniform.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
Congratulations.
I'm proud of you.

00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:18.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you were
able to graduate.

00:20:27.537 --> 00:20:29.004 position:61% line:89% align:start
  Nagisa...

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:30.307 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:20:30.407 --> 00:20:33.376 position:61% line:77% align:start
  [Tomoya]:
 I... really did
  it, didn't I?

00:20:34.077 --> 00:20:36.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:20:36.346 --> 00:20:40.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
  It's all over. I'll never
  be a student there again.

00:20:40.884 --> 00:20:45.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
To be honest, I really hated
that place... but, in the end...

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.925 position:27% line:83% align:start
 because I was with you,
 I wanted to stay there forever.

00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:52.230 position:16% line:83% align:start
It sucks. There were so many
times I was so miserable

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
that I wanted to quit...
 but you know...

00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:58.768 position:5% line:83% align:start
 the last year I spent with you,
  I finally enjoyed myself.

00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:03.975 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I was finally happy!

00:21:04.075 --> 00:21:08.279 position:5% line:83% align:start
  I don't want to graduate now!
  I just want to stay with you!

[Nagisa]:
Tomoya...

00:21:14.386 --> 00:21:17.855 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't hold yourself back
over something silly like that.

00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:21.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you have the chance to move
on, then you should take it.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
I want you to
move on... okay?

00:21:29.034 --> 00:21:32.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the meantime, I'll try
my best for another year!

00:21:34.673 --> 00:21:37.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
And one more thing...

00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:40.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
would you mind holding
my hand for a while?

00:21:40.346 --> 00:21:43.983 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Idiot... what if it
 makes your fever go up?

00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:45.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
C'mon, a little
bit won't hurt.

00:21:45.985 --> 00:21:47.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
It doesn't have
to be far,

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just want to hold
hands and walk.

I wanted to keep walking

00:22:04.538 --> 00:22:07.508 position:5% line:89% align:start

  Uh, nothing in particular.

You don't mind me using

We're practically family now...
it only seems natural.
