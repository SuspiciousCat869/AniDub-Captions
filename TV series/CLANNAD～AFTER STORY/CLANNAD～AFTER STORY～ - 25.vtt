[Tomoya] <i>Ushio, let me tell</i>
 <i>you a little story</i>

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>about something that happened</i>
 <i>before you were born.</i>

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.779 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>Actually you might say this</i>
 <i>is the story about how you were</i>
 <i>born.</i>

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.685 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>You see, Mommy and Daddy</i>
 <i>first became friends in our</i>
 <i>senior year of high school.</i>

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Ushio] <i>Is that</i>
 <i>when you two met?</i>

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.325 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>That's right. Back</i>
 <i>then, we didn't even know each</i>
 <i>others' names.</i>

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
Anpan!

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.706 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Do you like
this school?

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:43.677 position:10% line:77% align:start
I have to say that I love it
very, very much. But soon
everything changes.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.313 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well at least it
does eventually.

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:58.827 position:21% line:71% align:start
[Nagisa] Fun things,
happythings, they'll all...
They'll all eventually change
someday you know.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.933 position:7% line:89% align:start
Can you still love this place?

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.537 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] Just go and find more.

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:21.785 position:13% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is find
other fun and happy things.

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:28.058 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, let's go.

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:16.707 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>That was the first</i>
 <i>time that Mommy and Daddy ever</i>
 <i>talked to each other.</i>

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:19.843 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>At the time, Mommy</i>
 <i>was a year older</i>

00:03:19.843 --> 00:03:21.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>than the other</i>
 <i>kids at school.</i>

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.720 position:16% line:83% align:start
What did... So what did
you want?

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.225 position:13% line:77% align:start
Nothing really. I was just
wondering why you were here
eating lunch alone.

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:36.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me ask you. Do you like this
school very much?

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:38.697 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not especially...

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:41.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
I love this school very,
very much.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.439 position:7% line:77% align:start
I used to have friends I could
talk to and teachers I was close
to.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.173 position:21% line:89% align:start
But now it's just...

00:03:47.173 --> 00:03:49.176 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did something happen?

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:53.813 position:10% line:77% align:start
It's just that I was out of
school for a long time last
year, so everything's different.

00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:55.614 position:38% line:89% align:start
And I...

00:03:55.614 --> 00:03:57.284 position:10% line:89% align:start
Have to take the year over?

00:03:57.284 --> 00:04:00.187 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm a repeater.

00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:09.197 position:19% line:71% align:start
Everybody that I knew
hasgraduated and gone on to
their lives. So there isn't
anyone I know here anymore.

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:12.166 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's kind of weird, but I feel
a little like Rip Van Winkle.

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Daddy was an outcast</i>
 <i>at school.</i>

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:40.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>But after I met Mommy, bit by</i>
 <i>bit, things began to change.</i>

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:44.401 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>My whole life started</i>
 <i>to turn around.</i>

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:47.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>You see, Mommy wanted to put</i>
 <i>on a play.</i>

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:51.107 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>But first, she had to bring</i>
 <i>back the school's Drama</i>
 <i>Club.</i>

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:53.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>That wasn't going</i>
 <i>to be easy.</i>

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:55.312 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Ushio] <i>But you helped</i>
 <i>her out, right?</i>

00:04:55.312 --> 00:04:56.746 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>I sure did.</i>

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:58.215 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>It really meant a lot to</i>
 <i>your mommy...</i>

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.550 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>so I couldn't just ignore</i>
 <i>her problem.</i>

00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:08.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>You know, Mommy loved the Big</i>
 <i>Dango Family even back then.</i>

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.928 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>Ushio, you like them, too,</i>
 <i>don't you?</i>

00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:12.630 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Ushio] <i>Uh-huh.</i>

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.770 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>Before the formed the club,</i>
 <i>Mommy used to practice all by</i>
 <i>herself.</i>

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.273 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>That play was very</i>
 <i>important to her.</i>

00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:28.381 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you'd like, I'll take
you there...

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:33.186 position:5% line:83% align:start
to a special place in town where
all your wishes come true.

00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>So we started making</i>
 <i>friends to join the club.</i>

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:40.494 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>The first person to help us</i>
 <i>out was Kyou Fujibayashi.</i>

00:05:40.494 --> 00:05:44.198 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>You know her, right? She's</i>
 <i>your kindergarten teacher.</i>

00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:53.841 position:7% line:77% align:start
We can't! How can I put this?
I-I mean it's not like we're
even going out or anything.

00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:55.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
And besides, what about Ryou?

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:57.945 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just stop right there! Listen!

00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:00.348 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please, just think this over
for a second.

00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:04.452 position:13% line:77% align:start
I know you're a guy so you
probably want to do these kinds
of things...

00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:07.523 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>And then there was</i>
 <i>her sister, Ryou</i>
 <i>Fujibayashi.</i>

00:06:07.523 --> 00:06:10.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>She was the class rep</i>
 <i>for Daddy's class.</i>

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
I do understand. I'll listen
to you seriously.

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:16.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're starting to look more and
more like a real drama club.

00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:20.769 position:7% line:77% align:start
I think girls are genetically
predisposed to be interested in
fortune-telling.

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:24.407 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>The smartest girl in</i>
 <i>the whole school also joined</i>
 <i>us.</i>

00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:26.809 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Kotomi Ichinose.</i>

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>She was Daddy's</i>
 <i>childhood friend.</i>

00:06:30.713 --> 00:06:32.482 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's divine...

00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:34.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>We made lots</i>
 <i>of other friends too.</i>

00:06:34.918 --> 00:06:37.721 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Like a junior named</i>
 <i>Tomoyo Sakagami.</i>

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.561 position:7% line:77% align:start
As they say, the road goes on
and on. Let's both give it our
best.

00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:44.861 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoyo] Make it a promise.

00:06:47.298 --> 00:06:50.101 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>And Misae Sagara,</i>
 <i>the dorm mother...</i>

00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:52.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>And then there was</i>
 <i>Yukine Miyazawa,</i>

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.407 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>who was always hanging out in</i>
 <i>the reference room and giving us</i>
 <i>advice.</i>

00:06:55.407 --> 00:07:00.912 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Miyazawa told us about an old</i>
 <i>town legend that's been passed</i>
 <i>down for generations.</i>

00:07:00.912 --> 00:07:06.852 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>According to the legend, when</i>
 <i>someone achieves true happiness,</i>
 <i>a ball of light appears.</i>

00:07:06.852 --> 00:07:09.021 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>If you catch one of them,</i>
 <i>then it can make a wish come</i>
 <i>true.</i>

00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:14.527 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ushio] <i>What about</i>
 <i>Uncle Youhei?</i>

00:07:14.527 --> 00:07:16.162 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Oh yeah, he was</i>
 <i>there, too.</i>

00:07:16.162 --> 00:07:19.132 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's part of the deadly game
we all know too well...

00:07:19.132 --> 00:07:25.606 position:10% line:83% align:start
A game of love! A boy's love
game you might say!

00:07:25.606 --> 00:07:31.412 position:5% line:71% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>I worked hard withhis</i>
 <i>little sister, Mei, to try and</i>
 <i>get him back on the soccer</i>
 <i>team.</i>

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:34.248 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>I really owe him one.</i>
 <i>If he hadn't been around...</i>

00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:38.319 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>Daddy probably would have</i>
 <i>dropped out of school before he</i>
 <i>met Mommy.</i>

00:07:45.293 --> 00:07:50.665 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>We all went our separate ways</i>
 <i>after graduation, but we still</i>
 <i>meet up from time to time.</i>

00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:52.834 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I guess you know that already</i>
 <i>though, don't you?</i>

00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:55.870 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>You saw everyone when they</i>
 <i>came over for New Year's.</i>

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:02.144 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>A whole bunch of other stuff</i>
 <i>happened before we brought back</i>
 <i>the Drama Club.</i>

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:05.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>For example, Kouko Ibuki and</i>
 <i>Yuusuke Yoshino got married.</i>

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:09.518 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>Kouko had a younger sister</i>
 <i>who was in the hospital but</i>
 <i>she's better now.</i>

00:08:09.518 --> 00:08:11.120 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's your friend, Fuko.</i>

00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:15.124 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>We had to do more than just</i>
 <i>look for club members.</i>

00:08:15.124 --> 00:08:19.029 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>We also had to find a teacher</i>
 <i>who would help take care of the</i>
 <i>club.</i>

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:24.067 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Unfortunately, the teacher we</i>
 <i>needed was already the advisor</i>
 <i>of the Choir Club.</i>

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:27.672 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>Then things got complicated</i>
 <i>and we had to challenge the</i>
 <i>Basketball Club...</i>

00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:31.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>to a match to show the Choir</i>
 <i>Club how serious we were.</i>

00:08:33.977 --> 00:08:39.150 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>In the end, everything worked</i>
 <i>out and Kyou and Sunohara joined</i>
 <i>the Drama Club.</i>

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.188 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>Thanks to all the help wehad</i>
 <i>from our friends, the club was</i>
 <i>finally on its way to</i>
 <i>recovery...</i>

00:08:44.188 --> 00:08:49.827 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>That was good for Mommy, but</i>
 <i>Daddy still had his own problems</i>
 <i>to deal with.</i>

00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:53.632 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] Dad, if you're going to
sleep you should move to your
bed.

00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:55.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on, Dad. Wake up.

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:57.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, well look at this, will you?

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:01.907 position:7% line:83% align:start
It seems that I've caused you
such trouble again, Tomoya.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:07.847 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Back then, Daddy</i>

 <i>very well.</i>

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:13.019 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>I got really mad and left</i>

[Tomoya] J-Just a... [Sanae] So
it's plain to see why they
haven't sold!

00:09:29.103 --> 00:09:31.473 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] Like mother like
daughter, I guess...

00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:33.608 position:10% line:83% align:start

[Nagisa] Shio-chan, Daddy,
Fu-chan! Come on you guys, let's
go home.
