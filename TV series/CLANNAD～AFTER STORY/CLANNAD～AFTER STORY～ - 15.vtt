00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:05.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nagisa... let me be the
first to get your autograph!

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.782 position:19% line:89% align:start
What doting parents...

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure, you may laugh now,
but if you have a daughter,

00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:11.384 position:16% line:89% align:start
you'll be the same way.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.285 position:7% line:89% align:start
No way, old man, that's gross.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
I dunno, I think he may
be right, Tomoya.

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:16.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're just like Dad, after all.

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:19.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
No way, man, that's gross!

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:22.060 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Akio]: Two months, huh?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yep, I'm two months along.

00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:25.194 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're gonna have it, right?

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:27.195 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course I am.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.197 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's gonna be tough.

00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:30.665 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm here to protect her.

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:32.734 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:36.003 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right, I don't have to
worry as long as I have Tomoya.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.372 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've made it this far by
working together, haven't we?

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's funny how much Tomoya
reminds me of you, Akio.

00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.042 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wha-?

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.843 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: When we found out
I was pregnant with Nagisa,

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:47.878 position:24% line:83% align:start
you said the exact
same thing, remember?

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:49.679 position:7% line:89% align:start
You promised to protect her...

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: I did say
that, didn't I?

00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:56.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hang in there, you little
good-for-nothing bum!

00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:58.386 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
"Good-for-nothing," huh?

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:00.989 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't afford to
be like that now.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nagisa will have to
take time off from work...

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:06.359 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who knows if she'll
ever go back.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.362 position:24% line:83% align:start
It'll be up to me
to support all three of us.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:16.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is it... we're
becoming a real family now.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
All this has got me
thinking, though...

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.670 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is this the way my father felt
before I was born?

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.739 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Yoshino]: Congratulations.

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.239 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]: What do you mean
what? I heard about the baby.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.543 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Young Staffer]: Baby?

00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:01.078 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Staffer]: Your wife had a baby?
I didn't know!

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:04.780 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Johnny]: Oh wow,
congratulations, Mr. Okazaki!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.415 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: No, uh... she
hasn't had the baby just yet.

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:10.018 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Who did you hear that
from, Yoshino?

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:13.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sanae told Kouko,
then Kouko told me.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.555 position:16% line:83% align:start
And by now, I'm sure all
of our neighbors know, too.

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:18.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
Never underestimate
the power of gossip.

00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:20.224 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even though you have a job,
you're still growing up

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:22.793 position:10% line:83% align:start
in a lot of ways... and now
that you're about to be a dad,

00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:24.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to grow up a lot faster.

00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:26.262 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah...

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:28.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's kinda sudden, I need
some time to let it sink in.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once your child is born,
I'm sure you'll understand

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.134 position:10% line:89% align:start
whether you want to or not.

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:33.868 position:7% line:89% align:start
We humans are strange beings.

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:36.070 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not one of us
can live on our own.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.705 position:7% line:83% align:start
@And yet, young or old, we're
all able to get through life

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:40.673 position:16% line:83% align:start
by giving and receiving
support from others.

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:44.143 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]: 4.5 billion years
ago, the Earth was born in a
small corner

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:47.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
of this vast universe...

00:03:47.612 --> 00:03:50.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Before I knew it,
several weeks had passed.

00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:53.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
As Nagisa entered
her third month,

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:54.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
her morning sickness got worse.

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:57.319 position:30% line:83% align:start
And she spent
a lot of time in bed.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Tomoya. I hate to trouble
you with all this stuff...

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:02.723 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:04.959 position:10% line:83% align:start
It only takes a few minutes;
It's no trouble at all.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.025 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm still sorry.

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.794 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nothing to apologize for.

00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:10.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
We work together on
everything, remember?

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:14.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have you had a chance
to eat anything today?

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:16.333 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but I didn't have
much of an appetite.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is there some medicine
that would help,

00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:19.401 position:19% line:89% align:start
or that sort of thing?

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:21.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not when it comes to morning
sickness,

00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.338 position:16% line:83% align:start
but there are things you
can do to help with the nausea.

00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:24.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
I get sick just drinking water,

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I have to get my fluids
with ice cubes.

00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:38.984 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow, it's cold.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:57.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ah, sorry. Didn't mean to
wake you up. You feeling okay?

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.465 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not too bad, I guess.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.466 position:30% line:89% align:start
@Good to hear.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
@Even if it's justúa little bit,

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:03.935 position:27% line:83% align:start
@you should try
toúeat when you can.

00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:06.336 position:33% line:89% align:start
@Open wide.

00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:10.506 position:19% line:83% align:start
You had to make dinner
all by yourself, didn't you?

00:05:10.506 --> 00:05:13.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
@Oh, you could tell? Guessúthey
aren't very pretty, huh?

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:16.545 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't care what they look
like. Let me give it a try.

00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:24.450 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks, it's good!

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.655 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
One again, time flew by.

00:05:29.655 --> 00:05:32.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was so wrapped up
in my daily life with Nagisa

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:33.257 position:10% line:89% align:start
that I hardly even noticed.

00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:35.892 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: Good morning!

00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:37.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
You sure you should
be out of bed?

00:05:37.794 --> 00:05:40.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
@I'm fine; I'm actuallyúfeeling
a lot better today.

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:41.931 position:27% line:83% align:start
@The last time I
wentúto the doctor,

00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:43.932 position:27% line:83% align:start
@he said things
shouldústart settling down

00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:45.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
@around the tenth week.

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:46.867 position:10% line:89% align:start
@It looks likeúhe was right!

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:48.836 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything's going
according to plan, huh?

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:51.804 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh! No complaints from me!

00:05:53.605 --> 00:05:57.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
I, uh... I need
to ask you something.

00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:59.577 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Home birth?

00:05:59.577 --> 00:06:01.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
@Yeah, actually, I wasúthinking
about giving birth

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:03.079 position:13% line:89% align:start
@right hereúin this room.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, you can really
do something like that?

00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:06.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
@Yesterday, when I
wasúat the hospital,

00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:09.750 position:7% line:83% align:start
@I picked up this brochureúfor
a maternity class.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.419 position:16% line:83% align:start
@It has an article about
mothersúwho gave birth at home

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
@and I thought I'd
likeúto do that!

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.823 position:7% line:83% align:start
After the mother gives birth,
the father steps in

00:06:17.823 --> 00:06:20.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
to give the child
its first bath...

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.493 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you have your baby
like normal at the hospital,

00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:24.095 position:13% line:83% align:start
you might not get to spend
much time with it

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:26.663 position:7% line:83% align:start
right after it's born. That's
why I thought it might be nice

00:06:26.663 --> 00:06:28.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
if we did it this way instead.

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:30.533 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmmm...

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.938 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is our home, so I thought
we should start our family here.

00:06:37.938 --> 00:06:41.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd like to have my baby in
my own town, in my own room...

00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:43.343 position:27% line:89% align:start
where I belong.

00:06:43.343 --> 00:06:45.078 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you think we could do that?

00:06:46.578 --> 00:06:49.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
She wants to give
birth at home?!

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:52.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Heh. How'd you like
myúcornering back there?

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
Could you turn that off, please?

00:07:00.822 --> 00:07:03.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
I dunno, kid. Giving birth
is enough trouble as it is.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Doing it at home is
justúgonna complicate things,

00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:07.294 position:24% line:89% align:start
@don't you think?

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.996 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know what you mean;

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:10.663 position:7% line:83% align:start
The doctor said he was worried
about Nagisa's health.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.298 position:24% line:83% align:start
Still, she's seems
really set on it,

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I'd like to do it if we can.

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:17.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, assuming it doesn't put
her health at risk, of course.

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:18.903 position:24% line:89% align:start
@[Sanae]ÚI agree.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:22.305 position:19% line:77% align:start
@You have to consider
safetyúfirst, for Nagisa AND the
baby.

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:25.208 position:16% line:77% align:start
@But still... I see why
youúwould to have the baby at
home.

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:28.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
@The nurse took Nagisa awayúfrom
me as soon as she was born.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
@Of course, Akio got to hold
herúa little bit later...

00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:33.347 position:16% line:77% align:start
@but that was only after
theúhospital staff said it was
okay.

00:07:33.347 --> 00:07:36.249 position:10% line:83% align:start
They might've got the first
touch but I got the first lick!

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
Really Dad? You licked
me after I was born?

00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:41.320 position:7% line:83% align:start
@It's your fault for beingúso
cute; I couldn't resist!

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.754 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't care how cute I was,
you shouldn't do that!

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:46.590 position:5% line:89% align:start
@[laughs]úOh well, too late now.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.859 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, do you agree
with the home birth idea?

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm okay with it, as long
as Nagisa's healthy enough.

00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:55.529 position:16% line:83% align:start
When the baby's born...
you can hold it.

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:57.197 position:19% line:89% align:start
But lemme warn you...

00:07:57.197 --> 00:08:00.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna be the first to
lick that baby, you hear me?!

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:02.168 position:33% line:83% align:start
Nuh-uh, dad!
Tomoya's the father,

00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:03.702 position:13% line:89% align:start
so he gets the first lick!

00:08:03.702 --> 00:08:05.704 position:10% line:89% align:start
Actually, I think I'll pass.

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:08.240 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't want to?
Then dad it is...

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.540 position:35% line:89% align:start
@[laughs]

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.142 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Wow, you two are some pair...

00:08:13.643 --> 00:08:16.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: This is my friend Yagi.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.646 position:16% line:89% align:start
@She works as a midwife,

00:08:17.646 --> 00:08:18.713 position:13% line:83% align:start
@so I thought she mightúbe
able to talk to you

00:08:18.713 --> 00:08:20.048 position:19% line:89% align:start
@about the home birth.

00:08:20.048 --> 00:08:22.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nice to meet you.
I hope I can help out.

00:08:22.383 --> 00:08:24.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hello, I'm Nagisa Okazaki.

00:08:24.518 --> 00:08:26.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks for taking
the time to stop by.

00:08:26.186 --> 00:08:28.020 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hi, I'm her husband, Tomoya.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your mother tells me
you'd like to give birth

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:31.556 position:16% line:89% align:start
here in your apartment.

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:32.590 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes ma'am.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.359 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know it's a little run down,

00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:36.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
but do you think
it'd be possible?

00:08:36.193 --> 00:08:38.128 position:13% line:83% align:start
As long as it's a relaxing
environment, it's fine.

00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:40.163 position:13% line:83% align:start
But you still have plenty
of time to think it over.

00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:41.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yagi]: I'll go through all
of your options with you

00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:42.999 position:27% line:89% align:start
some other time.

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:45.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
We look forward to
working with you, ma'am.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.072 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yagi]: If anything new happens,
please don't hesitate to contact
me.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.373 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Thank you, ma'am. I will.

00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:56.108 position:10% line:83% align:start
I let Yagi know that Nagisa
has health problems

00:08:56.108 --> 00:08:57.443 position:24% line:89% align:start
before we came by.

00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:58.843 position:27% line:83% align:start
She said not to
talk about it too much,

00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:00.812 position:24% line:83% align:start
or it'll just make
Nagisa anxious,

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:03.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
regardless of if you go
with a home birth or not.

00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:04.815 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
I'll keep that in mind.

00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:12.787 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tomoya? What were you
talking to Mom about just now?

00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:15.390 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, uh, nothing really.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's all right, you don't
have to hide it or anything.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.094 position:21% line:83% align:start
You two were talking
about my health, right?

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.161 position:19% line:83% align:start
I understand that you
and my parents are worried,

00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:26.098 position:10% line:83% align:start
since I'm sure the delivery
is going to be tough on me...

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
but... even if something
bad happens to me,

00:09:28.498 --> 00:09:32.202 position:10% line:83% align:start
the only thing I want is to
give birth to a healthy baby.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.739 position:27% line:83% align:start
C'mon, Don't say
stuff like that!

00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:38.573 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen, everyone's
working together because

00:09:38.573 --> 00:09:41.109 position:21% line:83% align:start
we want you to have
a safe delivery.

00:09:41.109 --> 00:09:44.878 position:10% line:83% align:start
I should've thought of that.
I'm sorry, Tomoya.

00:09:47.046 --> 00:09:49.948 position:7% line:77% align:start
@You know, this really reminds
meúof when we were in high
school.

00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:51.216 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.884 position:10% line:83% align:start
@I mean, back when the drama
clubúwas working so hard

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
@so you could put on
yourúplay for the festival.

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:57.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Let's hope this
turns out just as well!

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:07.560 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: Do you know who I am?
I'm your Daddy! [Laughs]

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.196 position:10% line:89% align:start
@Don't lie to the baby, dad!

00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:11.164 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're gonna confuse it
before it's even born!

00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:14.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Wow, what a lame baby; It
can'túeven take a little joke?

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.001 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's Nagisa's baby, isn't it?

00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:19.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course it can't
take a joke... Grandpa.

00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:21.872 position:16% line:83% align:start
DAMN IT, DON'T YOU EVER
CALL ME THAT AGAIN!

00:10:21.872 --> 00:10:24.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, right. Akio wants
to be called, "Akki"

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:25.741 position:19% line:89% align:start
when the baby's born.

00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:27.675 position:10% line:89% align:start
@"Akki," you got it? "Akki"!

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.178 position:10% line:89% align:start
No more prenatal education!

00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:31.379 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know Akio is just joking,
but by this point,

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:33.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
your baby's ears have
probably developed enough

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.215 position:16% line:89% align:start
to hear outside sounds.

00:10:35.215 --> 00:10:37.251 position:13% line:83% align:start
You might want to consider
playing some music

00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:38.785 position:27% line:89% align:start
for it sometime.

00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:42.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, music's no problem;
I sing to it all the time.

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:49.025 position:7% line:83% align:start
@♪Dango, Dango, Dango, Dango,
Dango, Dango Family. ♪

00:10:52.495 --> 00:10:59.200 position:10% line:83% align:start

Dango, Dango Family... ♪

00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:07.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: At the time...
I thought everything

00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:09.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
was going to work out perfectly.

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:12.410 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well... that's what
I said at least...

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
but somewhere in my heart...
I knew that wasn't true.

00:11:17.113 --> 00:11:18.580 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm home.

00:11:19.315 --> 00:11:21.016 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nagisa!

00:11:21.016 --> 00:11:24.085 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'm fine. I just
feel a little weak, that's all.

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:26.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nagisa gave me a call a
while ago and I rushed over.

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:28.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
By the time I got here,
she'd apparently collapsed

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.356 position:30% line:89% align:start
on the floor.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.258 position:13% line:83% align:start
If something bad happened,
then you should've told me!

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:34.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry Tomoya... I didn't
want to bother you

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:36.761 position:24% line:83% align:start
while you were at
work, that's all.

00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:38.196 position:13% line:89% align:start
At any rate, don't worry.

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:39.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
The baby is still as
healthy as can be.

00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:42.165 position:10% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Well, that's good...

00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:46.835 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't be afraid to call me
if anything else happens.

00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:48.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Just to be (extra)
careful, ústarting tomorrow,

00:11:48.803 --> 00:11:51.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
@I'll look after Nagisaú
til you get off of work.

00:11:51.372 --> 00:11:53.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
@That should take a
littleústress off of you, right?

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.242 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yes ma'am.
I really appreciate it.

00:11:59.078 --> 00:12:02.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
@How are you feeling?úls
there anything you want?

00:12:02.713 --> 00:12:04.915 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, I have everything I need.

00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:06.749 position:7% line:89% align:start
As long as I have you with me,

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:08.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
then there's nothing
to worry about.

00:12:08.586 --> 00:12:12.321 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're tough, aren't you? Well,
I'll try not to worry, myself.

00:12:17.058 --> 00:12:20.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't be afraid, Tomoya,
everything's gonna be fine.

00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:23.162 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah. You're right, of course.

00:12:23.162 --> 00:12:26.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whatever happens, we can
get through it together.

00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:29.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
And besides, how can I worry
when I have you to protect me?

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:33.504 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:36.973 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]ÚEven though she said
that... everything had changed.

00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:40.342 position:19% line:83% align:start
@I couldn't pretend to
beúas happy as I was before.

00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:51.618 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sanae]: Tomoya.

00:12:51.618 --> 00:12:54.553 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh. Hey, Sanae.

00:12:54.553 --> 00:12:56.387 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, how was your day?

00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:59.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: This is where
Nagisa used to work? I see!

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:02.124 position:7% line:83% align:start
I always wanted to come here,
but never found the time.

00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:03.492 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a pretty groovy
place, isn't it?

00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.394 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're slang's a little off.

00:13:05.394 --> 00:13:08.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh? Well, now I feel old.
[slight chuckle]

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

00:13:17.336 --> 00:13:19.538 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:22.306 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's about Nagisa and the baby.

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:24.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
I spoke with her doctor
the other day

00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:26.544 position:7% line:83% align:start
and he said there may be some
risks we didn't know about

00:13:26.544 --> 00:13:28.444 position:19% line:89% align:start
when she gives birth.

00:13:28.444 --> 00:13:31.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
And just for the record,
I haven't told Nagisa yet.

00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:34.282 position:7% line:83% align:start
The doctor told me in private,
but you should know, too.

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:41.188 position:10% line:83% align:start
You say some risks, but what
exactly do you mean by that?

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.722 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you saying that
Nagisa might die?

00:13:44.722 --> 00:13:47.959 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure; They said the
burden placed on her body

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:50.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
will be a little greater
than a normal delivery.

00:13:50.027 --> 00:13:51.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
But that's speaking for Nagisa,

00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:54.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
the childbirth itself
should be unaffected.

00:13:54.163 --> 00:13:55.598 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:13:55.598 --> 00:13:57.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, that's assuming
Nagisa' health stays stable

00:13:57.832 --> 00:13:59.301 position:24% line:89% align:start
for the delivery.

00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:01.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
As you know, her condition
gets worse sometimes.

00:14:01.936 --> 00:14:04.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
That could be a serious
factor in this as well.

00:14:04.438 --> 00:14:06.839 position:10% line:83% align:start
To be honest, we don't know
much about Nagisa's illness,

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:08.774 position:16% line:89% align:start
so it's hard to predict.

00:14:08.774 --> 00:14:11.276 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Sanae]: I think the doctor was
worried about a worst-case
scenario,

00:14:11.276 --> 00:14:13.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
but we should be ready
for anything.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.581 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's hard to say
what's the right choice

00:14:16.581 --> 00:14:19.049 position:10% line:83% align:start
and what's the wrong choice
in this situation.

00:14:19.049 --> 00:14:21.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why I wanted to go
over things with you first;

00:14:21.383 --> 00:14:23.385 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you could give it some
careful consideration.

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:26.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
Take some time and talk
to Nagisa about it.

00:14:26.254 --> 00:14:27.821 position:19% line:83% align:start
Once you've discussed
the situation,

00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:30.123 position:27% line:83% align:start
you can talk to
the doctor together.

00:14:30.123 --> 00:14:33.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then we can all make a decision
together as a family.

00:14:34.894 --> 00:14:37.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
Considering the
worst-case scenario...

00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:41.265 position:7% line:83% align:start
do you think we should give up
on having a baby, now?

00:14:41.265 --> 00:14:43.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid that isn't
my place to say.

00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:48.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
However... if you go that route,

00:14:48.438 --> 00:14:52.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
you should do it as
quickly as you can.

00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:54.108 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sanae]: I want you two to
really think about this.

00:14:54.108 --> 00:14:56.109 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Thanks for caring
for us so much, Sanae.

00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:57.911 position:19% line:89% align:start
It really means a lot.

00:14:57.911 --> 00:14:59.945 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're a family, after all.

00:15:03.282 --> 00:15:06.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I still
want to have the baby.

00:15:06.084 --> 00:15:08.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, it's fine; I had a
feeling you'd say that.

00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:11.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know I'm weak and this
could be a risk for me...

00:15:11.154 --> 00:15:13.489 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I don't want to rob
my child of a chance at life

00:15:13.489 --> 00:15:15.123 position:27% line:89% align:start
because of that.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.292 position:13% line:83% align:start
So if it's safer to have a
delivery at the hospital...

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:20.595 position:10% line:83% align:start
then I don't mind giving up
on the home birth.

00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:23.029 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:26.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tomoya... I want to see
our child, no matter what.

00:15:29.101 --> 00:15:31.336 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Akio]:
So, what did the doctor say?

00:15:31.336 --> 00:15:33.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
He said she would
have fewer risks

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:35.038 position:24% line:83% align:start
if she gave birth
at the hospital.

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:37.873 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess that's a relief,
but I'm still worried about it.

00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:41.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
I take it Nagisa hasn't changed
her mind on the issue, then?

00:15:41.277 --> 00:15:43.778 position:44% line:89% align:start
No.

00:15:43.778 --> 00:15:47.381 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]ÚI think she's pretty
scared@about this whole thing,
though.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:49.316 position:27% line:83% align:start
She tries to act
like she's happy,

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:52.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
but she probably feels
the same way I do.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.259 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right. Come with me.

00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:18.638 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here you go, my secret hideout
in all its glory.

00:16:18.638 --> 00:16:20.439 position:10% line:83% align:start
I come here to play baseball
with the kids...

00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:23.207 position:24% line:83% align:start
or just space out
and spend some time alone.

00:16:23.207 --> 00:16:25.976 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: I get it. So all those
times you disappeared from work,

00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:28.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
this is where you came.
Not quite what I expected.

00:16:28.145 --> 00:16:31.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Akio]: They've been cutting
down the trees bit by bit.

00:16:31.013 --> 00:16:32.281 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sooner or later...,

00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:34.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're gonna build
a hospital here.

00:16:34.983 --> 00:16:37.185 position:7% line:89% align:start
Anyway, that's not the point.

00:16:40.254 --> 00:16:44.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
Remember that story I
told you two years ago?

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:46.191 position:24% line:83% align:start
When I was in the
theater troupe, I mean.

00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:50.328 position:7% line:83% align:start
Back when Sanae was a teacher,
before we had the bakery.

00:16:50.328 --> 00:16:54.665 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Akio]: Like I told you before,
Nagisa ended up staying by
herself

00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:57.933 position:16% line:83% align:start
a lot during that time.
On that particular day,

00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:01.102 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sanae had to go to work and we
ended up leaving Nagisa home

00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:02.370 position:30% line:89% align:start
with a fever.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course, we tried
to get off work,

00:17:04.072 --> 00:17:07.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
but it just didn't work out.

00:17:07.507 --> 00:17:09.710 position:13% line:83% align:start
When we left her, Nagisa's
condition was stable,

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.912 position:13% line:83% align:start
so we hoped we'd get back
before anything bad happened.

00:17:13.912 --> 00:17:15.913 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately,
Nagisa went outside,

00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:17.816 position:10% line:89% align:start
waiting for us to come home.

00:17:17.816 --> 00:17:20.317 position:13% line:83% align:start
We found her collapsed in
the snow when we came back.

00:17:20.317 --> 00:17:22.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
By dawn, things were
looking pretty grim.

00:17:22.518 --> 00:17:26.154 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't even know that kind
of sadness was possible.

00:17:27.122 --> 00:17:28.423 position:7% line:89% align:start
What I'm about to tell you now

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've never told
anyone but Sanae.

00:17:31.392 --> 00:17:33.761 position:24% line:83% align:start
Before I knew it,
I was running and running

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.229 position:16% line:89% align:start
with Nagisa in my arms.

00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:38.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know what I was
doing or where I was going,

00:17:38.831 --> 00:17:40.998 position:10% line:89% align:start
but somehow I ended up here.

00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:45.803 position:7% line:89% align:start
I fell to my knees and prayed.

00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:47.070 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please help Nagisa.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't want her
to die like this.

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:54.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
That was all I could do.
That was my only hope.

00:17:54.342 --> 00:17:57.378 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then, all of a sudden it was
like the grass and the trees

00:17:57.378 --> 00:18:01.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the sun enveloped Nagisa
with this warm light.

00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:08.252 position:30% line:83% align:start
It seemed like
a dream at first...

00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:11.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
but it couldn't be...
it had to be real.

00:18:15.057 --> 00:18:17.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tears welled up
in my eyes, and I swear,

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:20.829 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've never been so grateful
in my entire life.

00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:24.431 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ever since then... I've tried
to keep an eye on this place.

00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:27.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
I almost feel like
it's another part of Nagisa.

00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:30.669 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a strange story, huh?

00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:32.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm telling you,
it really happened

00:18:32.504 --> 00:18:33.805 position:27% line:89% align:start
just like that.

00:18:33.805 --> 00:18:36.741 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah. I believe you.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
Course that doesn't mean
you can pray and magically have

00:18:39.342 --> 00:18:41.277 position:13% line:89% align:start
all your wishes come true.

00:18:41.277 --> 00:18:43.311 position:21% line:83% align:start
But still... I think
if you push and shove

00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:45.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
with all you got until
the bitter end...

00:18:45.414 --> 00:18:48.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
even if it ain't a miracle, the
results won't be all that bad.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.284 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:18:50.284 --> 00:18:52.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, I'm not saying she
should have the baby.

00:18:52.318 --> 00:18:55.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Nagisa has the most to lose,
so she should decide.

00:18:55.254 --> 00:18:56.555 position:7% line:89% align:start
And whatever her decision is,

00:18:56.555 --> 00:18:58.390 position:19% line:83% align:start
we should all shut up
and accept it.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
Y'know, kid... I mean, Tomoya...

00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:04.261 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hate to say it, but I got
a feeling you got a lot of

00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:06.730 position:19% line:83% align:start
hardship and a lot of
sadness ahead of you.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
But together, you two...
or rather, all of us...

00:19:10.064 --> 00:19:12.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
should be able to overcome it.

00:19:14.335 --> 00:19:15.135 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:17.204 position:10% line:89% align:start
Remember, we're family, now.

00:19:18.304 --> 00:19:20.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're here to help
each other out.

00:19:30.681 --> 00:19:32.215 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: I love the breeze.

00:19:32.215 --> 00:19:34.517 position:13% line:89% align:start
It feels so nice and cool.

00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:38.754 position:10% line:89% align:start
[gasps] The baby just moved!

00:19:38.754 --> 00:19:40.488 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, really?!

00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:44.825 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:19:44.825 --> 00:19:47.960 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a weird feeling, like
it's sliding around in there.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.562 position:33% line:89% align:start
No kidding?

00:19:55.732 --> 00:19:59.068 position:13% line:83% align:start
Guess we'd better come up
with a name, huh?

00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:02.672 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I haven't
thought about it much,

00:20:02.672 --> 00:20:05.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
but we need a boys name
and a girls name, don't we?

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:07.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
Either way, how bout
we take a character

00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:08.476 position:16% line:89% align:start
from your name, Tomoya?

00:20:08.476 --> 00:20:10.811 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nah. It doesn't matter to me.

00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:13.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
Besides, it'll have
my last name either way.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let's take something from your
name, instead, how bout that?

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
But... my name's kinda
hard to work with,

00:20:18.082 --> 00:20:19.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
so it'll end up sounding silly.

00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:23.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Like Nagisako or Nagisami
or something like that.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, okay, Nagisa
means shore, right?

00:20:26.355 --> 00:20:28.858 position:13% line:83% align:start
So how bout we think of a
name that has an ocean theme?

00:20:28.858 --> 00:20:30.758 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, good idea.

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:34.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
In that case, how bout...

00:20:34.027 --> 00:20:38.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ushio. We can use
the character for tide.

00:20:38.097 --> 00:20:39.632 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ushio?

00:20:39.632 --> 00:20:41.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yep. Strong and fearless,
the rising and falling

00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:46.170 position:13% line:83% align:start
ocean waves... the endless
ebb and flow of the tide.

00:20:47.938 --> 00:20:49.673 position:27% line:89% align:start
Perfect, right?

00:20:49.673 --> 00:20:52.642 position:13% line:83% align:start
And best of all, it works
whether it's a girl or a boy.

00:20:55.077 --> 00:20:57.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
So it's, Ushio...

00:20:57.178 --> 00:20:58.646 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, huh?

00:20:58.646 --> 00:21:01.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
@A lot of things happen in life;
Some of them good

00:21:01.147 --> 00:21:03.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
and some of them bad...
but... no matter what,

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.352 position:13% line:77% align:start
@the tide will always come
backúto the shores, again and
again.

00:21:06.352 --> 00:21:07.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
And so, I'll stand by,
watching...

00:21:07.853 --> 00:21:11.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
just as the shores watch
the tide come and go.

00:21:11.956 --> 00:21:13.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you're saying
the tides are bigger

00:21:13.457 --> 00:21:16.158 position:10% line:89% align:start
and stronger than the shore?

00:21:16.158 --> 00:21:19.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course. They travel
the whole ocean.

00:21:19.729 --> 00:21:21.129 position:19% line:89% align:start
And like the ocean...

00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:22.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
I hope our child
isn't just strong...

00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:25.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope it's as kind and
nurturing as the deepest waters.

00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:26.834 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you agree?

00:21:26.834 --> 00:21:28.568 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I hope so, too.

00:21:30.803 --> 00:21:33.372 position:19% line:77% align:start
@We couldn't go to the
beachúthis summer after all,
huh?

00:21:33.372 --> 00:21:36.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know. It's a shame, isn't it?

00:21:36.507 --> 00:21:39.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
I really wanted to go
to the beach with you.

00:21:39.175 --> 00:21:40.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, then
let's make a promise.

00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:42.812 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa]: A promise?

00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:44.948 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah. We're going to come to
the beach with Ushio next year

00:21:44.948 --> 00:21:45.948 position:27% line:89% align:start
no matter what.

00:21:45.948 --> 00:21:47.716 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a promise.

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:49.317 position:30% line:89% align:start
A promise...,

00:21:53.387 --> 00:21:56.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh. You promise,
right... Nagisa?

00:21:58.457 --> 00:22:01.526 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course. I promise...

00:23:43.636 --> 00:23:46.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi]: I've been talking
about one Hidden World,

00:23:46.071 --> 00:23:49.172 position:10% line:83% align:start
but there may be any number
of them out there.

00:23:49.172 --> 00:23:51.375 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, there may be
as many worlds

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:53.710 position:13% line:83% align:start
as there are possibilities
in our lives.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.946 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Fujibayashi, you said
something like that a long time
ago

00:23:56.946 --> 00:23:59.081 position:19% line:83% align:start
when you were telling
our fortunes, right?

00:23:59.081 --> 00:24:01.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Ryou]: Right. The future
isn't something predetermined,

00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:04.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
there are all sorts of
possibilities out there.

00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:06.919 position:19% line:89% align:start
I still believe that.
