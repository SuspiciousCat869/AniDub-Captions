00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:07.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Tomoya.
It's morning, wake up!

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:10.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Breakfast is ready, when you
are; Don't let it get cold.

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, thank you...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]:
Sorry to make you do this.

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's fine. I don't mind at all.

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:22.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what about you?; You seemed
pretty worn out last night.

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:25.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, my muscles are still
aching like crazy.

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:27.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I feel a little better
than before, though.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:30.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Try not to push yourself
tooúhard out there, okay?

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:31.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
Morning everyone;
How's it going?

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.167 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:44.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good morning. Go ahead
and get changed.

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes sir!,

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're not holding the
spanner the right way.

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:03.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
I showed you how to do it
yesterday, remember?

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:04.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! Sorry!

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Also, you're using
too much thread lock!

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fasten the screws
in diagonal order;

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me
you forgot already!

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:11.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! Sorry!

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:12.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
Stay focused up there.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
Little mistakes can cause
big accidents.

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:15.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes sir!

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm home from work.

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
Welcome back!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm cooking some pork for dinner

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
to help give you
more stamina tomorrow!

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, thanks. That sounds great!

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll be finished soon, so get
some rest in the meantime.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh... the bath is ready, too.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:37.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sniffling and clearing throat]
Thanks.

00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:41.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Man on TV]ÚI told
you, that's mine!

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Woman on TV]: Awwww...

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Man on TV]: If you want
one, go buy one yourself.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:46.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Tomoya,
are you tired again?,

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:49.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? Not really.
I'm much better today.

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.100 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.868 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Nagisa is the one
thing holding me together right
now.

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:58.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
She sees me off in the morning,

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
worries about me while I'm at
work, and makes sure I'm okay

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
when I make it home.

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:06.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
As long as I have her, I don't
think any job could get me down.

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're getting better,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
but why do you always do things
the hard way? I don't get it.

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:10.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do what? What do you mean?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's easier to use both
of your hands, isn't it?

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:14.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do you favor
your left hand so much?

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:19.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
@Uh... I guess it's kinda weird,
but it's easier for me.

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:21.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hm. That's fine.

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:25.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's not like you're doing
anything wrong, I suppose.

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:28.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know he doesn't look like
much, but I like him.

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
@[Nagisa]ÚTomoya? Hey, Tomoya?

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, sorry, what is it?

00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:40.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
@I keep saying your name,

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:42.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
@but you just stare
offúlike you can't hear me.

00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:45.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know, I know. I was
just thinking about work.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:46.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
I-I'm sorry...

00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:49.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why are you apologizing?,

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:51.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
@You've been havingúsuch
a hard time at work...

00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:54.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
@but when you come home all I
doúis go on and on about myself.

00:04:54.868 --> 00:04:55.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
@I'm sorry.

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:57.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, you got it all wrong!

00:04:57.267 --> 00:04:59.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm always happy
to hear about your day!

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're not being rude!
It's a nice change of pace!

00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:08.367 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa]: You haven't told
Yoshino that your right shoulder
is bad?

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:10.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
He probably should know...

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:11.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't do that.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:14.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he finds out, then he
might not let me work anymore.

00:05:14.234 --> 00:05:16.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
I didn't think of it that way...

00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:18.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
And besides, even if
Yoshino didn't mind,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
that still doesn't mean
my boss will approve.

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:22.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm lucky I found a job
that pays so well

00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:24.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
right out of high school.

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:26.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd hate to be fired
before my first paycheck.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right, but don't let
yourself get hurt

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:29.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
over something like that.

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:31.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't worry; I'll try
to be careful.

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:36.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right then,
see you tomorrow.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Good night.

00:05:38.968 --> 00:05:40.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, aren't you lonely
at your new place?

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:44.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's just; You'll be
all alone after I leave.

00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it were me, I think
I might be kind of sad.

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:50.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Maybe it's
not a big deal to you,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
but it makes me want to cry
just thinking about it.

00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:57.067 position:13% line:77% align:start
@Heh. Now that's silly. No
reasonúto cry over something
like that.

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:58.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
I guess so... But-

00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:01.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
Once you leave, I go straight
to sleep, so it's not a problem.

00:06:01.634 --> 00:06:04.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway, don't sweat the
small stuff, I'll be fine.

00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:08.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:20.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, what are we doing?

00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:22.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to make a
construction photo ledger

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
for process management.

00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:25.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Here, hold this.

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:35.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
@Thanks Yoshino.úKeep
up the good work.

00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:36.200 position:33% line:89% align:start
@Is that...?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mr. Kinoshita!,

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:40.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now that's a surprise; Are
you two friends or something?

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, it was quite a while back,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I used to work for the same
company as Tomoya's father.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:47.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would see Tomoya when I
visited their house after work.

00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:49.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kinoshita]: I'm surprised!
You sure have gotten big!

00:06:49.934 --> 00:06:52.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty surprised myself,
I didn't think I'd run into you

00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:54.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
in a place like this,
Mr. Kinoshita.

00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
The last company I worked for
went under a while back,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I applied here.
So how's your father these days?

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:03.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ah... well... I'm living
on my on these days,

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:05.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
so I don't see him very often.

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:08.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]: Work takes
us all over the place,

00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:10.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
so these sort of things
are bound to happen

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
every once in a while.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
Makes you realize how small
the world really is..

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
I dunno; It doesn't
seem small to me;

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, it feels like
my world just got bigger.

00:07:19.534 --> 00:07:21.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
Really interested
in those photos, huh?

00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:23.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just made me realize
something, that's all.

00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:26.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
Before I knew it, all these
big buildings had popped up

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
all over the place.

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:31.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]:
This is only the beginning.

00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:34.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just wait, once they finish all
the roads they're working on,

00:07:34.334 --> 00:07:37.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
new companies and new shops will
start showing up everywhere.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're about to build a
big hospital out here, too.

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:41.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
It seems hard to believe.

00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:45.067 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: In a way, I kinda
don't want it to change so
fast...

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:54.100 position:13% line:77% align:start
@Hey, if you're free next
Sunday, údo you wanna go out
somewhere?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry, I can't.

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:57.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a mock entrance
exam that afternoon.

00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:00.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
A mock exam?; But you're not
going to college, are you?

00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:03.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, probably not, but I
still want to take the exam

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
with everyone else in my class.

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:07.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why I was
apologizing to you.

00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:09.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.934 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: You and I seem to be
on different schedules these
days.

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:14.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa (sadly)]: Mm-hmm...

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:17.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ah... it's nothing to feel bad
about. Good luck on the test.

00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:19.634 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Now remind me again...

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:25.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
why am I hanging out
with you on my time off?

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:27.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
Cause I happen to have
some time off, too;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
So don't be such a little turd.

00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:32.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, let's have a little fun
for grownups. What d'ya say?

00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:34.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
"Fun for grownups"?

00:08:34.834 --> 00:08:37.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is my favorite toy store;
I'm a regular here.

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:39.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
A regular, huh?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's up?

00:08:55.901 --> 00:08:57.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
You impudent whelp!

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:03.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
@I hate to say so,
úbut I think your new friend

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
@is a littleúslow in the head.

00:09:04.934 --> 00:09:07.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nah, he's a rookie, that's all.
Cut the guy some slack.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
A rookie!? You mean
there are pros!?

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:12.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anyway, let's go ahead and
call this a draw for today.

00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:17.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
In that case, that makes
123 wins, 171 losses,

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:19.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
and 32 draws for me.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is your idea of
fun for grownups, huh?

00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:22.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nah, we're just getting started.

00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
So... my special order
come in, or what?

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:28.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
Heh. Come on,
who do you think I am?

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Akio]: Go ahead, open it up.

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:33.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the heck is this?

00:09:33.634 --> 00:09:35.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why, it's Lizard, the Bengal
Monitor Lizard, of course.

00:09:35.834 --> 00:09:37.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Lizard the lizard, huh?

00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:39.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna take this
critter home to Sanae...

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then stick it
down her shirt!

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Heh... Why, just thinking about
it sets my heart aflutter!

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:46.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's some sense of romance...

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:48.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you feel sorry for Sanae?
Why would you do that?

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:50.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't be so stuck up.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't want your marriage
to get stale, you gotta give

00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:53.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
your lady something
to get excited about

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:56.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
every now and then.
Might try it yourself, someday.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
You give the worst
advice in the world.

00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:01.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hi Tomoya. Haven't
seen you in ages, huh?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
@Uh, y-yeah.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
By the way, Sanae,
what are you afraid of

00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:07.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
most in the whole wide world?

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:08.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
@That'd be the Bengal Monitor
Lizard, of course!

00:10:08.934 --> 00:10:10.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: So specific!,

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:11.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's what I thought!

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:14.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ahhhh! Look!; There's one
right over there!

00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:16.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
What?! H-here in the shop?!

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:17.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ah! It went over there!

00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:18.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:23.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please forgive me, Sanae!

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ahh! Oh no! Look out! Sanae,
it just went down your shirt!

00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:32.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Sanae panicking]
Someone get it out!

00:10:32.234 --> 00:10:34.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
@Ah, damn, looks like I
reallyúoutdid myself this time!

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do something about it!

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:39.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sanae! Tomoya did it!

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:41.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ahhh! No fair!

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:43.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh my. They sure are lively
today, aren't they?

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:46.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mrs. Isogai, sorry
for making so much noise!

00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:49.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
@No, it's fine! Those twoúare
so much fun to watch!

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
@Everyone in the
neighborhoodúcan't wait to see

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:53.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
@what the Furukawas do next.

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh... Is that so?

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:56.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
@[Sanae]ÚSomeone
get@it out! Help!

00:10:56.901 --> 00:10:58.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
@[Akio]ÚSanae, wait!

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
I guess I'm going after them.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, of course. Don't worry.

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:03.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll watch over the shop
until you get back.

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:05.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah, thank you.,

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.534 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]:
Wow, that was a real surprise!

00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:12.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
I see my parents running all
the time when I get home,

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:14.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I've never seen you
running with them!

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:16.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah man, I bet Sanae
hates me now.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Heh, I think you got it
backwards, Tomoya.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
After today, I bet you
two will get along

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:22.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
even better than you did before!

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not so sure. I put a Bengal
Monitor Lizard down her shirt.

00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:28.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like I told you, my mom and dad
run around like that

00:11:28.968 --> 00:11:31.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
all the time, but I bet this
is the first time someone else

00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:33.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
has run around with them;

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:36.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
So if you ask me, that
means you're like family now.

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:37.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
@Wow, you reallyúthink so?

00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:40.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: Oh... um...
by the way, Tomoya...

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:43.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
do you remember what happens
on the next NEXT Sunday?

00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:44.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a special event...

00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:46.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
The next NEXT?

00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:48.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, your birthday's in
December, so it's not that...

00:11:48.868 --> 00:11:50.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's the Founder's Festival
at our school.

00:11:50.934 --> 00:11:53.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know the drama club has
been disbanded and all...

00:11:53.701 --> 00:11:55.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
but that doesn't mean I can't
have fun seeing what all

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
the other students put together.

00:11:57.834 --> 00:12:00.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, uh... I thought...

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:05.634 position:33% line:83% align:start
Sounds good.
Let's make it a date.

00:12:05.634 --> 00:12:07.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Phew. Today was pretty
rough, huh?

00:12:19.067 --> 00:12:20.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're telling me, buddy;

00:12:20.968 --> 00:12:23.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
I feel like we really earned
our paycheck on that one.

00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:25.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
Good work out there today.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
Organizing some papers, huh?

00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:29.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
@Yeah, it's too much ofúa
pain to do it by myself.

00:12:29.734 --> 00:12:32.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
@But he's a
realúnatural at this.

00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:36.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Hmm... I see. Pretty impressive.

00:12:36.734 --> 00:12:39.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's no big deal. I'm just
organizing them by date.

00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:42.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, looks annoying. I couldn't
take five minutes of that.

00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
Guess I could help you with
this pile, if you like.

00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:47.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, no; Thanks anyway,
but I already finished those.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't let him do it, kid.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
If he touches those papers,

00:12:50.434 --> 00:12:52.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
you'll never get
them in order again.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who do you think
you're talking about?

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have you know
I was an accountant

00:12:54.868 --> 00:12:56.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
before my company downsized!

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
@If you're looking
forúextra work that bad,

00:12:58.234 --> 00:13:00.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
@you can doúmy job for me.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'm
almost done here.

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:04.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you guys want to go
home, you can go ahead.

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:08.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
@Good. In that case,
úsee you later.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:13:09.868 --> 00:13:11.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
@See you.

00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:12.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
So long. I'll see
you tomorrow, boss.

00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:15.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
@All right. Catch you later.,

00:13:15.534 --> 00:13:18.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
Y'know, I really am glad
you signed on with us.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're about to get
a really big contract

00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:23.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
and we've been short on
workers for a long time.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thank you, but I still don't
know how to do anything...

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on, don't be so modest.

00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:30.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just started and I hear you
can do most of the work already.

00:13:30.367 --> 00:13:32.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: I'll warn you, you may
have to work on the weekends

00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:35.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
a bit more now, but
you're doing a great job!

00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:40.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa (singing)]: Founder's...
Founder's... Founder's Festival.

00:13:40.334 --> 00:13:42.767 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't wait til next week.

00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:46.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
@Nagisa...

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes? Dinner's almost done...

00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
Actually, this isn't about
dinner, it's about work.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
If things get busy,
I might not be able

00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:58.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
to make the Founder's
Festival after all.

00:14:00.801 --> 00:14:02.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry. I hate to say that

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:05.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
when we don't spend enough
time together as it is.

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:09.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it so much.

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:10.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think it's good that
you're busy with work;

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:13.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's nothing to be sorry about.

00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:14.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:14:14.534 --> 00:14:16.667 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
a little disappointed,

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:18.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I'm glad you're
working so hard

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:20.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
and your job is going so well.

00:14:20.767 --> 00:14:22.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm really sorry...

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
Get me the diagonal cutter.

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:31.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
No problem.

00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:35.400 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
Next, I need 210 millimeters
of triple-core VVF cable.

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:39.834 position:27% line:89% align:start
Strip both ends.

00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:41.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
How much should I strip?

00:14:41.334 --> 00:14:43.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
Should be 2 centimeters
if it's insulated, right?

00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:46.634 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Yoshino]: Yeah, but you can do
either if you strip four
centimeters.

00:14:46.634 --> 00:14:48.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
Remember that.

00:14:48.033 --> 00:14:49.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, I see. Thanks;
That helps a lot.

00:14:49.968 --> 00:14:53.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, get some wrapping 38 ready.

00:14:53.067 --> 00:14:54.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
Protective tubing, huh?

00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:56.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
You need standard
or flame-retardant?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
Better to use flame-retardant.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
It'd be bad if this burned.

00:15:05.334 --> 00:15:07.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
You can finish up the rest.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna take a look
over there, all right?

00:15:09.634 --> 00:15:11.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
@No problem.

00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:15.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Be careful and don't rush.
I'll come back when I'm done.

00:15:15.067 --> 00:15:16.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:32.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya]: Uh, Yeah.
I hate to ask, but if possible,

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd like to have the
day off tomorrow.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:36.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's fine.
It's perfect actually.

00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:38.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a holiday, so you
wouldn't be working anyway.

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:40.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
I didn't know!,

00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:42.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
By the way, how's your
right shoulder doing?

00:15:42.434 --> 00:15:44.133 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:46.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can't raise your
right arm, can you?

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
I could tell by watching you.

00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:50.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
You must've known
for a while now.

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you say
something to me sooner?

00:15:53.367 --> 00:15:55.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even if I did, it wouldn't
have done any good.

00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:58.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all, you've been doing
your job just fine.

00:15:58.367 --> 00:16:00.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
You've been working hard to
overcome your handicap

00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:04.133 position:33% line:83% align:start
out there...
you should be proud.

00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:07.567 position:16% line:77% align:start
You know... work's gonna
getúharder and harder from now
on.

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:09.400 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you can't handle it, you
don't have to push yourself.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can always pick up the slack.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
You sure that's
all right? I mean,

00:16:13.334 --> 00:16:15.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't want to end up
being a burden to you...

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
We get help for the
things we can't do.

00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:19.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the whole point
in having a company.

00:16:19.868 --> 00:16:21.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
There'll be times when
I can't do something

00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:24.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I'll need your help.
Nothing wrong with that.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.567 position:16% line:77% align:start
So in short, If you work
tooúhard, you might have an
accident

00:16:28.567 --> 00:16:30.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
and make that
girlfriend of yours sad.

00:16:30.234 --> 00:16:32.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
We wouldn't want that to happen.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
[sobbing lightly]

00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:38.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Tomoya]: Thank you so much.

00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:49.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: Aww, no! Everybody
went home already! No good!

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:50.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, I made a stupid mistake
and one of our jobs

00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
got left out of the schedule.

00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:58.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's this one here. Could you
do something like this?

00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:00.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it should be all right.

00:17:00.334 --> 00:17:02.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's the same thing I've
been doing with Yoshino.

00:17:02.367 --> 00:17:04.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's great! Sorry, I hate
to ask but you wouldn't mind

00:17:04.434 --> 00:17:06.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
taking care of it for
me, would you?

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:08.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like right now, by myself?

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:10.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah... I have some other
work I gotta get done, too.

00:17:10.501 --> 00:17:12.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll drop you off at the
site then come back

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:15.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
to pick you up when
you're done, okay?

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:16.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:17:20.534 --> 00:17:22.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sighing]

00:17:31.567 --> 00:17:32.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yoshino...

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just got a phone call
from the boss.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
I tried to get over here
as fast as I could.

00:17:36.767 --> 00:17:39.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Were you able to handle
things on your own?

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I think so.

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:45.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Did you check the junctions?

00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:48.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I checked the whole
circuit after I was finished.

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:50.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you remember to
remove the coating?

00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:53.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes. I double checked
the measurement, too.

00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:02.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, good work.
Let's head back. It's late.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:18:06.634 --> 00:18:10.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: I'm going to
festival ahead of you, okay?

00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:11.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, that sounds
good to me;

00:18:11.601 --> 00:18:13.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll meet you at the
front gate of the school.

00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:15.033 position:38% line:89% align:start
See ya!

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing] Hm?

00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:25.868 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:18:25.868 --> 00:18:27.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Boss]: Uh, hey... Okazaki,

00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:30.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
do you know what happened
at the site yesterday?

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:32.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:35.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: I got a call from
Yoshino just a little while ago.

00:18:35.334 --> 00:18:37.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
He said that he noticed a
mistake and that he's going

00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:40.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
to fix it ASAP. I tried
to find out what was wrong,

00:18:40.601 --> 00:18:42.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I couldn't get
anything out of him.

00:18:42.734 --> 00:18:44.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I thought that
you might know something,

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:46.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
since you were there.

00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:48.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
@Yoshino!

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:50.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
Okazaki, what are
you doing here?!

00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:52.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?! [panting]

00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:54.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
If I'd done my job right, you-

00:18:58.067 --> 00:18:59.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yoshino]: It's not your fault.

00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:00.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
It is!

00:19:00.701 --> 00:19:02.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
It slipped by me too;

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
I didn't think about it
until you went home.

00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:05.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
By then it was late,

00:19:05.133 --> 00:19:07.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I decided to
fix it up today instead.

00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:08.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
I admit you were careless,

00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:11.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I should've noticed it
before you left.

00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:14.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
You have plans with Nagisa,
don't you? Hurry up and go.

00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:16.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let me take responsibility!

00:19:16.601 --> 00:19:17.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forget it!

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yoshino, please!,

00:19:24.067 --> 00:19:27.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need some low insulation
tubing. Six meters of type 20.

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:29.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:29.634 --> 00:19:30.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come on, get moving!

00:19:30.934 --> 00:19:32.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:19:53.767 --> 00:19:55.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, Tomoya...

00:19:55.834 --> 00:19:57.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nagisa...

00:19:57.601 --> 00:20:00.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you were at work,
huh? I thought so.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
Something sudden
must've come up.

00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:09.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wow, Tomoya, you sure
are sweating an awful lot!

00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:13.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
No reason to be upset;

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:17.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
You haven't done anything
to apologize for.

00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:20.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Here, take one; I bought
us both some roasted corn.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
We can eat it on the way home.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're coming, right?

00:20:32.534 --> 00:20:34.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, right...

00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:48.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:20:48.434 --> 00:20:52.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
I heard that you had a tough
time yesterday, Mister Okazaki.

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:53.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:20:53.901 --> 00:20:56.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Johnny]: I heard about
what happened from Yoshino.

00:20:56.334 --> 00:20:58.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Never thought I'd meet a guy
who'd skip out on a date

00:20:58.234 --> 00:21:00.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
to come to work!

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.901 position:16% line:77% align:start
@Shoulda told me, man; I
wouldaútaken care of that date
for ya!

00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:04.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry it worked out that way,
but if it's any consolation,

00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:06.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll pay you overtime
for your work.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
I-I appreciate it,
but it was my mistake;

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
I thought you'd be upset...

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]:
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:21:11.968 --> 00:21:14.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, the important thing
is how you make up for them.

00:21:14.934 --> 00:21:17.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
You gave it your best
out there and in the end,

00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:19.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
you didn't cause
the client any problems.

00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:22.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
From now on... just don't make
the same mistake again

00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:23.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
and you should be fine.

00:21:24.801 --> 00:21:26.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
And if you still feel guilty...

00:21:26.434 --> 00:21:28.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
then when you're showing
another rookie the ropes...

00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:31.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
if he makes a mistake,
you cover for him!

00:21:31.868 --> 00:21:34.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just remember, that's your job!

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:36.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
And also...

00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:37.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
Your LOVE!

00:21:37.868 --> 00:21:39.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sighing]

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you, Yoshino!
I'll never forget that!

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:44.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure about
the love part,

00:21:44.334 --> 00:21:45.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I can agree with
the other stuff.

00:21:45.968 --> 00:21:49.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
All right, ladies, enough chit
chat. Let's get to work now!

00:21:49.467 --> 00:21:51.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
@Okay. Yes, sir.

00:21:51.267 --> 00:21:55.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Boss]: Oh, Okazaki,
I finally had this made for you.

00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:57.801 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:57.801 --> 00:21:59.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okazaki, let's move!

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, right!

00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:44.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]: You know,
I feel like your kindness

00:23:44.167 --> 00:23:47.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
has really been shining
through lately.

00:23:47.534 --> 00:23:50.367 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Tomoya]: Y'know, I used to
think being nice to people was a
hassle.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:53.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
Heh, kinda funny, considering
how I was always butting

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
into other people's problems.

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:58.100 position:7% line:77% align:start
[Nagisa]: I support you either
way... so whichever choice you
think

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
is best, is best for me.

00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:09.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yoshino]: Don't ever lose sight
of what's important to you.
