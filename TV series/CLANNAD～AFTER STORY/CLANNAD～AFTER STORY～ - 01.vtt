[Nagisa]
Tomoya, watch out!

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:29.843 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:31.278 position:27% line:89% align:start
[both grunting]

00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:33.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
Be careful!
That was a close one!

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:36.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I just spaced out
for a second...

00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:37.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
-I got it!
-Daydream all you want,

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.154 position:5% line:83% align:start
but don't come crying to me
when I knock out your teeth.

00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:41.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's cheer for Dad,
okay, Tomoya?

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:44.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
I promise he won't knock
your teeth out on purpose.

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:47.528 position:16% line:83% align:start
Go, Akio! Show them
a good fight out there.

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:49.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Keep your eye
on the ball, Sanae!

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:53.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because this homerun...
is for you!

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:54.636 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[gleeful laugh]
-Another perfect hit!

00:00:54.737 --> 00:00:56.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was great, Dad!
You're the best!

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:58.240 position:27% line:89% align:start
  [laughing]

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
-You saw that?!
-[glass breaks in distance]

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:02.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:03.512 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa]
Uh...

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.716 position:27% line:89% align:start
[opening song]

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:36.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, we're playing baseball.

00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:38.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.617 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Don't give me that!

00:02:39.717 --> 00:02:41.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
We got another big game
coming up this Sunday,

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:44.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
so you better put together
a winning team for me, or else!

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
I never agreed to that!

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.893 position:5% line:83% align:start
The guys we're playing
are a bunch of shop owners

00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:49.094 position:5% line:89% align:start
from another town.

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:50.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
But that's not the point.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:52.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
The point is these bastards
are our sworn enemies.

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.302 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a big deal. Dad plays in
the league for grown-ups, too.

00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:58.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
Anyway, our enemy's been
recruiting guys

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
who played in the
high school nationals.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:02.541 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a dirty trick,
but thanks to them,

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:05.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
our team has been on a hell
of a losing streak.

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:06.946 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our team has been losing?

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:09.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is that why the neighborhood
has been so depressed lately?

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:10.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
So the point is,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
if we wanna cheer up our
friends and neighbors,

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
we gotta win this next
game at all costs.

00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:15.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can scrap the
whole damned roster.

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:18.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
All that matters is that you put
together a winning team.

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, but why's it gotta be me?
-You're starting

00:03:20.628 --> 00:03:22.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
-your second semester, right?
-Nagisa, could you please...

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
-...pass me the soy sauce?
-Sure!

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:25.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you got plenty
of buddies in the drama club

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:26.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
that'd be willing
to help you out.

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:29.638 position:5% line:83% align:start
I saw how well you guys worked
together at the School Festival.

00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:30.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
With a little practice,

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.575 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet you'd make a bang-up
baseball team!

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:35.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
Plus, if you're gonna
date Nagisa,

00:03:35.543 --> 00:03:37.280 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'd better score some
points with daddy too, get it?

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey! You know I can't play
baseball; my shoulder's no good!

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:44.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
All that matters is the flame
you got burning in your heart!

00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:47.024 position:5% line:89% align:start
Light it like a fireball!

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:48.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're talking crazy talk.

00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:52.629 position:27% line:89% align:start
[chime tinkling]

00:03:57.034 --> 00:03:59.469 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] <i>Our last semester</i>
 <i>is starting.</i>

00:04:08.012 --> 00:04:10.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sometimes I think my life
will be over

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:12.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
before I figure out
what to do with it.

00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:15.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou] You kidding? Of course
I'll play with you guys!

00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:17.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we have you
on the team, Kyou,

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:18.457 position:5% line:89% align:start
there's no way we can lose!

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:19.959 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I gotta admit, Nagisa,

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
your dad must have
a pretty keen eye for talent

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
if he's scouting
the great Youhei Sunohara!

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, apparently he sensed
your amazing athletic abilities

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
with his psychic powers.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:29.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
What can I say?

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
A talent like mine
can't help but shine...

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.573 position:5% line:83% align:start
even if I try to live
a normal life.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.410 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, that didn't take much.
Good thing he's so gullible.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
Say what now?!

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:39.981 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just kidding!
You're an incredible genius!

00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:41.182 position:5% line:89% align:start
An incredible athlete!

00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:42.817 position:5% line:83% align:start
Incredibly thin, providing
incredible protection...

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.019 position:5% line:83% align:start
-...even at night!
-You called it!

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:47.755 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tomoya, do you think I could
play baseball with you, too?

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:50.392 position:38% line:83% align:start
 Uh, do you know
 the rules, Kotomi?

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:52.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think I have a pretty
good idea.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
Since I watched you and Tomoyo

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:54.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
when you played against
the school team,

00:04:54.963 --> 00:04:56.865 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've wanted to give
it a try ever since.

00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:58.368 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[Youhei] You saw that?
-[Tomoya sighs]

00:04:58.468 --> 00:05:00.370 position:27% line:83% align:start
What about you, Ryou?
Are you gonna play?

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, I'll just
cheer from the sidelines.

00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:04.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sports aren't
exactly my strong point.

00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:06.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I guess that makes two
people cheering for you!

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.346 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't let us down,
okay, Tomoya?

00:05:09.446 --> 00:05:10.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kyou] Hmm?

00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:11.614 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [Tomoya] What now?

00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:12.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's nothing...

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.152 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just cute to see you two
acting like a couple.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:16.587 position:27% line:89% align:start
 [both gasp]

00:05:16.687 --> 00:05:18.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, you think so?

00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:21.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not like you to call on me
like this. Is something wrong?

00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:24.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sunohara told me he wants to
get nasty with you in public.

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.865 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[loud blast]
-[Youhei cries]

00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:28.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess I should've known
that Tomoyo

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
would pass the strength test
with flying colors.

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:32.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not your
guinea pig, damn it!

00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:34.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:36.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Thanks for joining
the team, Tomoyo.

00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:38.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're happy to have you!

00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:39.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

00:05:39.845 --> 00:05:41.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
All I said is that I <i>might</i> join

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:43.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you could get
Misae to join too.

00:05:43.682 --> 00:05:45.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
Misae looks like
she's in pretty good shape.

00:05:45.584 --> 00:05:47.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
We gotta make sure
we recruit her no matter what.

00:05:47.354 --> 00:05:50.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
  Don't worry, she'll do it
  for me. We go way back.

00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:52.726 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Oh!
-Huh?

00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:54.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
Isn't that Yusuke Yoshino?

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:57.398 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Tomoyo] Oh yeah, the guy
from the wedding, right?

00:05:57.498 --> 00:06:00.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
While we're at it, we might
as well ask him to join, too!

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.970 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! Yoshino!

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] I don't think
he can hear you.

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:07.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
  Let's do a "Yoshino call!"

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:08.810 position:38% line:89% align:start
  A "Yoshino call"?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, like when you want
an encore.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
He used to be in
a rock band, right?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
We gotta speak his language
if we want him to hear us.

00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:16.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
All together.

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:20.155 position:16% line:89% align:start
  Yoshino! Yoshino!

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.024 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yoshino!

00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:24.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yoshino! Yoshino!

00:06:24.726 --> 00:06:31.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
  Yoshino! Yoshino!
  Yoshino! Yoshino!

00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:33.703 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you making fun of me, punk?

00:06:33.803 --> 00:06:36.941 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, guys, but I can't do it;
I work on Sundays.

00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.708 position:61% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see...

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:40.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gotta get back
to my job. See ya.

00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:42.246 position:50% line:89% align:start
 Wait a second.

00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:43.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomoya, I know how you feel,

00:06:43.948 --> 00:06:45.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
but but we shouldn't force him.

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:47.918 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yoshino, my friend here,
Sunohara,

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:50.122 position:5% line:83% align:start
-he really looks up to you.
-Huh?!

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:52.324 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Tomoya] His family
is from Tohoku.

come back here again.

meant that much.

something sooner.

been so short with you.

  So, you'll do it?

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:18.586 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'll make some

No, not this time.

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:45.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
It sounds strange, but I want
to play baseball with you.

[Misae] Huh? Baseball?

00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:49.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Because you're my, uh...

as my rival, as well.

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:55.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know it's selfish,

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:57.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if we were able to play
sports together,

00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:58.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel like I could learn
a lot from you.

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:01.599 position:5% line:83% align:start
It really would really mean
the world to me.

00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:06.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, I can't say "no"
to those puppy dog eyes.

I can't believe we put
together the whole team.

Now all we need is Mei

your dad to come, too...?

00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:21.688 position:5% line:83% align:start
If he saw how hard
you're working,

00:08:21.787 --> 00:08:23.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
I bet he'd be proud.

00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:25.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
Also, I...

00:08:25.158 --> 00:08:28.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd like to meet him.
I've never met him before...

 Hi, Mei. I'm glad you
 could make it in time.

00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:58.760 position:27% line:83% align:start
  When I said she could
  meet Yusuke Yoshino,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
she jumped on the express train.

Believe it or not, I still
remember you from high school.

Anyway, you two look
like a happy couple!

keeping an eye on first base

could stop these guys from

getting hits, even if we had an
experienced pitcher out there.

00:12:51.012 --> 00:12:52.046 position:5% line:89% align:start
But since we have a rookie

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's probably
gonna throw wild,

00:12:53.816 --> 00:12:56.284 position:5% line:83% align:start

They took the lead
because of your wild throw!

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:53.639 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not to mention your
sloppy play before that.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and right before that,
you dropped a pop fly,

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
fumbled with the ball, and put
their go-ahead runner on base.

00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:03.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Misae] Sorry, I tensed up.

00:18:04.018 --> 00:18:06.653 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's only one out.
Come on, Nagisa, you're up.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:07.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! Okay.

00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:09.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
 [Mei]
 Take it easy, Nagisa!

00:18:09.858 --> 00:18:11.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kouko] Just try to focus,
all right?

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotomi] Take a deep breath
and swing!

00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:15.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kyou]
Relax, it's okay!

00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:17.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter
if you strike out!

00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:20.169 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just swing the bat with no
regrets and never look back!

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:22.738 position:27% line:83% align:start
No regrets and
never look back...

 [crowd gasps]

00:18:27.476 --> 00:18:29.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nagisa] I did it!

00:18:29.478 --> 00:18:31.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Yeah!
You do me proud, Nagisa!

00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:33.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
   <i>I can't hold back this time!</i>

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.384 position:50% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:37.187 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:40.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's a damn shame,
but what can you do?

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
am I smiling right now?

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:45.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I wouldn't
call that a smile.

00:18:45.462 --> 00:18:46.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope that you can forgive me

00:18:46.797 --> 00:18:48.933 position:5% line:83% align:start
for letting you down
like this...

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:50.335 position:5% line:89% align:start
For this memory.

00:18:50.434 --> 00:18:51.502 position:5% line:89% align:start
And yet...

00:18:51.602 --> 00:18:53.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will smile in the end!

00:18:53.437 --> 00:18:55.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give it your best, Yuu!

00:18:57.809 --> 00:19:01.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is a gift from me to you!
Now watch!

00:19:02.114 --> 00:19:03.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
[crowd gasps]

 -[cheering]
 -Sweet!

00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:06.819 position:5% line:89% align:start
Got a go-ahead runner on base!

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
 -[Yoshino] Children...
 -Huh?

00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:10.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the
only gift I can-

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.692 position:38% line:89% align:start
T-time out, okay?

00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:15.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the only gift I can
give you right now, children.

00:19:16.096 --> 00:19:20.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
A formless treasure.
A memory of our time together.

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.036 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have no money to spare.

00:19:22.136 --> 00:19:25.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have no material
possessions to pass on.

00:19:25.139 --> 00:19:26.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
But even so...

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
formless though they may be,

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
these precious memories
will live on forever.

00:19:31.947 --> 00:19:34.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
In my heart...
I know this is true.

00:19:34.282 --> 00:19:36.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
[pitcher] Uh... Are you done?

00:19:36.618 --> 00:19:39.688 position:38% line:89% align:start
  Yeah. Thanks you.

00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:41.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right! That's my man!
[Misae sighs]

00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:45.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you, Yoshino, your words
really touched my heart!

00:19:54.304 --> 00:19:55.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
[deep inhale and exhale]

00:19:56.073 --> 00:19:57.641 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Akio] Hey, kid.

00:19:58.507 --> 00:19:59.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
Two outs, bases loaded.

00:19:59.776 --> 00:20:01.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't do a squeeze play now.

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:04.349 position:5% line:83% align:start
The rest you're gonna have
to figure out yourself.

00:20:04.449 --> 00:20:07.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
But with my shoulder, I can't...

00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:09.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[Sanae] Okazaki.
-Huh?

00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:11.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give them a fight!
We're counting on you!

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the only one who can
bring Nagisa home safe!

00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:17.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
Good luck, Okazaki.
I believe in you.

00:20:17.628 --> 00:20:19.798 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you won't
let us down out there.

00:20:19.898 --> 00:20:22.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, Tomoya,
you'll do just fine.

00:20:22.768 --> 00:20:26.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Akio] Give this town...
a win, kid!

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.032 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Misae, if you don't mind,

00:20:51.132 --> 00:20:53.435 position:5% line:83% align:start
do you think I could come over
and visit sometime?

00:20:53.534 --> 00:20:55.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course!
Stop by whenever you like!

00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:57.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:20:57.906 --> 00:21:00.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
Feel free to eat
as much as you like!

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:02.577 position:5% line:83% align:start
Everything looks so good,
I don't know where to start!

 [oinking and meowing]

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
Something's been
bothering me all day.

00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:08.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who is that lady?

00:21:08.818 --> 00:21:10.353 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nagisa's big sister?

00:21:10.453 --> 00:21:12.321 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Uh, yeah, something like that.

00:21:12.423 --> 00:21:14.824 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Youhei] Wow,
a pair of hotties...

00:21:14.924 --> 00:21:18.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nagisa, I have a little
favor to ask of you...

00:21:18.162 --> 00:21:19.329 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
[whispering]

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
Man, that sure felt great,
didn't it?

00:21:23.067 --> 00:21:25.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seriously, we must be
the best team ever!

00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:28.072 position:27% line:83% align:start
 You looked really cool
 out there, Sis.

00:21:28.173 --> 00:21:30.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe we should turn this team
into a full-time thing!

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
Any time you want to make
some more memories...

00:21:32.877 --> 00:21:34.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
you guys give me a call.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:36.549 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone, together now...

00:21:36.648 --> 00:21:40.652 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here's to the Furukawa Bakers'
stunning victory...

-[all] Cheers!

 [ending song]

00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:46.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Sunohara, have you ever
thought about your future goals

00:23:46.222 --> 00:23:47.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
or what you want
to do with yourself?

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hm... Can't say it's
come to mind, no.

00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:53.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
Obviously, college
is out of the question,

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I guess I'll just find any
old job and work any old way.

00:23:59.002 --> 00:24:00.837 position:5% line:89% align:start
But if I happened to find

00:24:00.937 --> 00:24:02.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
a responsible girlfriend
to look after me,

00:24:02.806 --> 00:24:05.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
I bet Mei wouldn't be
so worried all the time.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.311 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's it!

00:24:07.411 --> 00:24:10.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nagisa] Well, Sunohara,
good luck out there.
