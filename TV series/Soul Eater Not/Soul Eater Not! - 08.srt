1
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,833
Look!
She's finally waking up!

2
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,416
Huh? What?

3
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,750
It feels like I'm
laying on a warm bosom.

4
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,000
Uh, well you aren't, sorry!

5
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,166
It's just my legs,
and before it was Meme's.

6
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,666
Hers started to
fall asleep, though,

7
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,541
so she asked me to take
over as the designated pillow.

8
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,791
Oh, well, thank you.

9
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,625
[TSUGUMI] I guess
this is the hospital, then?

10
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:34,083
[ANYA] Yes. They're
operating on her right now.

11
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:40,791
She needed surgery?
This is really happening.

12
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,250
I can't believe
it. It's horrible!

13
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,000
I was hoping all of
it was just a bad dream.

14
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,958
Sid asked us questions
earlier about Eternal Feather,

15
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,291
like you would
expect given what happened.

16
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,083
He wanted to know if
there had been anything

17
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,583
troubling her, or
if she'd gotten involved

18
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,458
with any bad
influences and so forth.

19
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,833
But we came up with nothing.

20
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,208
Can you think of
something we might have missed?

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,125
No, nothing. I'm sorry.

22
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,000
As far as I know, things
were completely normal with her.

23
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,333
What do we do? She
can't die! She won't, will she?

24
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,583
Don't say things like that.

25
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,625
That kind of
attitude won't do any good.

26
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,125
Sid told us not to worry. He
said everything would be okay.

27
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,291
Apparently, the DWMA
has their very own doctor.

28
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,250
And he's supposed to be
exceptional at what he does.

29
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,375
Sid said that? Really?

30
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,791
Yes.
And he said it's that doctor

31
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,000
who's doing
the surgery. It's okay.

32
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,666
I'm sure she's gonna be fine.

33
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,291
Whew!

34
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,000
However, he is
quite an unusual fellow.

35
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,541
He's made a lot of
modifications to his body.

36
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,791
There are even some
terrible rumors that he secretly

37
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,291
collects cadavers in
his ongoing quest to create

38
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,833
the perfect zombie!

39
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,875
Zombies? No!

40
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,041
[TSUGUMI] Wouldn't it
be better if she simply died

41
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,583
rather than turn into
one of those horrible things?

42
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,375
[MEME] We can't give up
hope yet, Tsugumi! Really!

43
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,541
You never know.
It's possible she could turn out

44
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,666
to be a super cute zombie!

45
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,875
Maybe she'll even
be happier that way!

46
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,791
[TSUGUMI] No one
is happy as a zombie!

47
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,750
There's no sense
in worrying about it now.

48
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,291
All we can do is
have faith and wait.

49
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,583
You're right. Have faith.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,416
[AKANE]
Please be specific.

51
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,041
How would you describe
Eternal Feather's behavior?

52
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,541
It was really strange.

53
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,875
Like her body was there but
her spirit wasn't, you know?

54
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,666
People called out
to her, but she didn't respond.

55
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,375
It was almost like
she was being controlled.

56
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,166
Yeah. What about the crowd?

57
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,750
Did you see any
suspicious people around?

58
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,250
The bazaar was crowded
with all sorts of people.

59
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,208
I can't be sure.

60
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,541
[AKANE]
Take a look. Did you see her?

61
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,750
[MAKA] Oh! You've
already got a suspect, then?

62
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,333
Wow good job, Akane!

63
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,625
Yeah. I feel like
maybe I've seen her

64
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,291
somewhere before.
What's her story, anyway?

65
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,500
Why are you
guys asking about her?

66
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,416
Is she gonna be
EAT's next target?

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,916
Nothing's final.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,500
Her case is under investi-
gation by Central Intelligence.

69
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,875
They haven't given the okay
to release any information yet.

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,750
Do me a favor
and leak it anyway.

71
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,625
My GPA could use the help.

72
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,250
Yeah, how much are you paying?

73
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,375
[CLAY]
Hey, you guys!

74
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,791
[MAKA]
No cheating, Soul!

75
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,833
Any minute now. They said the
operation should be over soon.

76
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,791
All three of you
are waiting for the girl?

77
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,750
Yes, that's right.

78
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,666
I've completed the operation.

79
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:36,041
How did it go? Was the
operation a success, Doctor?

80
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,083
[STEIN]
A good question.

81
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,333
Gagantous to the max!

82
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,875
He's got an
enormous screw in his head!

83
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,125
[STEIN] Your friend is
just over in the next room.

84
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,666
If you'll follow me.

85
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,833
You haven't turned her into
a zombie or anything, have you?

86
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,000
[STEIN] The
anesthesia hasn't worn off yet,

87
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,666
so she's still asleep.

88
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,333
Here's hoping.

89
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,041
Gagantous! Ah!

90
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,083
She has a screw
in her head, too!

91
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,791
How could you
do something like that?

92
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,833
Do you know how people
are going to look at her now?

93
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,250
And how's she supposed to sleep?

94
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,750
She can't roll onto her side.

95
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,000
Maybe she would be
better off as a zombie!

96
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,458
I can always design a
special pillow to help with any

97
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,166
sleeping difficulties.
It shouldn't be a problem.

98
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,833
Though.

99
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,833
She would have made
a good-looking zombie.

100
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,916
The girl could be right.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,041
It's possible I
missed an opportunity.

102
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,500
I am glad that
she survived and all.

103
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,791
But she's going to
wake up sooner or later.

104
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,916
How do we explain this to her?

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,791
Just kidding!
Well, are you surprised?

106
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,666
Of course we're
surprised, you jerk!

107
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,916
Yes, we are, and relieved.
She's totally back to normal!

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,708
Yeah, she sure is. Maybe
a little too close to normal.

109
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,916
[TSUGUMI] You even
reattached her braid?

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,458
Unless, is that an extension?

111
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,833
[ALL] Her braid
has a life of its own!

112
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,416
Pretty cool, don't you think?

113
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,166
[ANYA]
Now what have you done?

114
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,291
Look, you two! Her braid! It's
trying to write something down.

115
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,000
[ALL]
Jesús Navas?

116
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,125
But why? What's it mean?

117
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,625
A message from beyond the grave!

118
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,125
But she isn't dead.

119
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,458
It's like a scene
straight out of The Thing!

120
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,083
[TSUGUMI] Move it,
Anya! Can't you run any faster?

121
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,041
[ANYA] Tsugumi!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

122
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,333
[TSUGUMI] No!
I can't! I can't! I can't!

123
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,791
[TSUGUMI]
Be careful where you step, Meme!

124
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,208
[ANYA] Wah!
The creep is smiling!

125
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,583
You cruel, sick, freaky
man! Her body isn't a toy!

126
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,125
How could you do this to her?

127
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,375
You fiend! You devil!
You pumpkin fetishist!

128
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,250
[STEIN] Oh, calm down.
That was just another joke.

129
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,083
Your friend is
actually behind these curtains.

130
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,250
Huh?

131
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,000
[ALL] She still
has a screw in her head!

132
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,916
[STEIN] Now, as you can see,
I was able to save her life,

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,916
but she'll need to remain
in the hospital for a while.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,750
[STEIN] The wound
on her neck was very deep.

135
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,250
Much deeper than
I would have imagined

136
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,375
a self-inflicted wound could be.

137
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,125
I don't understand.
Why would she do such a thing?

138
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,291
Just because she
couldn't sell her clothing?

139
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,791
No, surely.

140
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,291
No doubt that matter
is under investigation.

141
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,541
It doesn't change the fact
that she injured others during

142
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,375
the incident. Depending
on what the reasons were

143
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,708
for her actions, it
may be a long time before

144
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,708
she returns to the DWMA.

Oh, hello, there, Sid.

[SID] You saved a life,
Dr. Stein. We appreciate it.

That's my job, isn't it?

Although actually,
it isn't supposed to be.

00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,416
in this sort
of thing. As far as I know,

158
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
you're the only doctor
who could have saved her life.

159
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,625
I know her
friends were grateful.

160
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,708
Terrified of you,
but still grateful.

161
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,625
That's worth
something, don't you think?

162
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,291
[SID] You know, we could
really use you at the DWMA.

163
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,875
It would be a tremendous help.

164
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:13,708
Back to that again, are we? You
know me better than that, Sid.

165
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,875
I'm more suited for labor-
atory research than teaching.

166
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,375
[SID] Yeah. Well, anyway,
was there anything suspicious

167
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,083
left behind on the girl's body?

168
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,916
[STEIN]
Now that you mention it.

169
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,583
[STEIN] As you requested,
I conducted a thorough

170
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,666
examination, looking over
every inch of her for clues.

171
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,291
I found a strange wound
on her left index finger.

172
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,125
It was tiny, as if she'd
been pricked with a needle.

173
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,250
[SID] Any toxins
in her bloodstream?

174
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,208
[STEIN] No. Nor was
there any sign of mental

175
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,000
imbalance. She has no
memory of the event, either.

176
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,458
If I had to guess,
I'd say, she was injected

177
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,375
with an undetectable
amount of toxin, and

178
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,833
then most likely subjected
to some sort of mind control.

179
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,250
You're talking about magic?

180
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,916
[STEIN] Well,
I can't say for sure.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,916
[STEIN] But there's absolutely
nothing abnormal about her now.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,125
I believe returning her
to her regular life as soon as

183
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,791
possible would be the best
way to ensure a swift recovery.

184
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,750
It is definitely summer!

185
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,125
The sun is a lot brighter
in Death City than back home.

186
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,083
I'm roasting out here!

187
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,416
[TSUGUMI]
It's summer-style Kana!

188
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,791
I suppose.

189
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,083
That's adorable! Do you
like those ears you've got?

190
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
[KANA]
Not really.

191
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,166
I dunno. I think
she likes them okay.

192
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,083
[ANYA] What are
you up to out here?

193
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,166
Aren't we a little old
for playing in the water?

194
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,833
I'm not playing.
I'm doing something called

195
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,916
water sprinkling.
You just scatter water around.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,125
It cools things off a bit.

197
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,458
I hate to tell you this,

198
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,000
but I don't really
think it's accomplishing much.

199
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,875
It really helps,
I swear! True,

200
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,583
it doesn't dramatically
lower the temperature or

201
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,208
anything. But it's pretty.
It sets a scene, you know?

202
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,458
It sets a scene?
What kind of scene?

203
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,750
I don't get it at all.

204
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,291
Well. Um, let me think, here.

205
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,458
[crackling]

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,958
[crickets chirping]

207
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
See?

208
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,458
Sorry. It still
makes no sense to me.

209
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,166
Hmm. Maybe it would
help if you changed.

210
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,416
That outfit looks way
too hot for this weather.

211
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,875
There's nothing wrong
with my outfit, thank you.

212
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,333
[TSUGUMI]
If you say so, here.

213
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,958
Setting a scene.
I'm setting a scene.

214
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,375
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Ah! Please stop.

215
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,083
[TSUGUMI]
Eternal Feather, you're back!

216
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,208
You were discharged
from the hospital today?

217
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,083
If you'd told us, we
would've come to get you!

218
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,000
[ETERNAL FEATHER] Don't worry
about it. I was fine on my own.

219
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,333
I'll probably
always have this scar,

220
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,166
but I figure at the
DWMA, that's a badge of honor.

221
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,875
I promise it's
no big deal, really!

222
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,125
I feel great!

223
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,708
She has an enormous
screw in her back!

224
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,375
It was Doctor Stein's idea.

225
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,375
I wasn't sure about it at
first, but he thought it would

226
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,708
be amusing to wear
this when I saw you again.

227
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,416
Oh, really? Tell me, does
this face look amused to you?

228
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,958
I'm so
tired of that joke.

229
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,125
[MEME] Hey! You're home!
They finally let you out, huh?

230
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,125
I'm so glad
you're feeling better now!

231
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,916
Thanks, me too.
How are you doing, Meme?

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,916
I'm great! Oh, except...

233
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,458
You're back home. We should
throw a party or something.

234
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,125
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
That's a sweet thought.

235
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,208
Hey Jackie, is
something bothering you?

236
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,375
[ANYA] You look like
the world's coming to an end.

237
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,375
Me and Kim. We just broke up.

238
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,500
[JACQUELINE]
Huh? Hold on, Kim!

239
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,208
What do you mean?
Why would we split up?

240
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,708
[KIM] It feels
like we're rushing things.

241
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,791
We got together too quickly.

242
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,041
I just don't
think we know each other

243
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,750
well enough for
this kind of commitment.

244
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,125
[JACQUELINE]
That's why we teamed up!

245
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,250
So we could
understand each other better.

246
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,750
If I'm doing something wrong,
you can tell me what it is.

247
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,416
I'll do my best to fix it.

248
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,875
It's not like that. It's
nothing you've said or done.

249
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,666
I just don't feel like
this is something I can

250
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,958
deal with right now.

251
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,583
Something you can't deal with?

252
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,791
I knew it! I have
done something wrong!

253
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:20,833
[KIM] Let it go. I need
some space right now. Goodbye.

254
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,541
I don't
understand what happened.

255
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,291
We were doing so
well together, too.

256
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,333
What am I going
to do without her?

257
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,208
[ANYA]
Think about it this way.

258
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,333
Ultimately all she asked
for was a little space, right?

259
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,625
Yeah, Anya's right.

260
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,750
Maybe some time and
distance is all you need.

261
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,458
That works for a
lot of people, so I hear.

262
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,958
Right. Or maybe a
change in temperature?

263
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,916
Huh?
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,416
You know, cool down some.

265
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,250
That'll probably make it
easier for Kim to talk to you.

266
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,125
Yeah I guess I could do that.

267
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,708
Hey!

268
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,458
I actually have something that
might help with that right here.

269
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,916
[MEME]
A wind chime!

270

A wind chime?
What's it for?

271
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,666
That'll help?

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,375
Oh! Yeah!

273
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,500
Let us all take a moment
now to listen to its song.

Ah, just listen to
it sing. Isn't that nice?

00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,541
Such soothing sounds.
I'm getting cooler already.

Huh?
How is listening

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,458
to a bell supposed
to make you feel any cooler?

279
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,708
That's not what bells are for!

280
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,958
They don't cool
you off, they just ding!

Come on, don't you feel it?

people think I am? A dog?

now? This is what happens

00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,958
I sure hope you don't
think we'll keep waiting

310
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,708
on you for the
rest of our lives.

311
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,791
Actually, I'll be waiting.

312
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,791
Ooh, sneaky!
Yeah, okay, whatever.

313
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,958
I'll wait for you, too.

314
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,291
But still, ultimately,
this is a decision that only

315
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,750
one person can make.

316
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,708
[TSUGUMI] I don't know.
Both of you are so strong.

317
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,625
I've basically done
nothing since I've been here.

318
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,666
I don't feel like I deserve to
be partners with either of you.

319
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,666
Really, what's the use of a
weapon who doesn't have a blade?

320
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,750
I wouldn't even be
able to protect my meister.

321
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,416
[ANYA] Those are excuses.
What do you expect, huh?

322
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
That you'll magically
get stronger overnight?

323
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,583
Do me a favor.

324
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,500
Transform into your
halberd shape, okay?

325
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,583
[TSUGUMI]
Um, all right.

326
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,708
Over here!

327
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,375
You two are
amazing. You see now?

328
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,708
This isn't something
I just picked up one day.

329
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,375
I've received fighter
training my entire life.

330
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,916
Meme, too, I'd guess.

331
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,833
Probably. Though
I've forgotten about it.

332
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,458
Expect too much
from yourself too soon

333
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,166
and you'll be dis-
appointed. It will come in time.

334
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,375
But if what you really
want is to improve your skills,

335
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,208
then you should
decide on a partner,

336
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,666
and grow stronger together
with whoever you choose.

337
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,791
Don't you see?

338
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,875
You have to
make a commitment.

339
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,916
You've taken the
easy way out long enough.

340
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,291
Making excuses and
running from your responsibility

341
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,958
won't help anything.

342
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,708
You have no resolve, and you
will have no blade until you do!

343
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,333
I didn't know.

344
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,666
But right now, to choose between
the two of you, just like that.

345
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,666
No one's saying to
choose right this second,

346
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,291
and we aren't even
saying by the end of the summer.

347
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,416
Huh?

348
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,250
There's a harvest
festival on October 31st.

349
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,333
I believe you commoners refer
to it as "Halloween," right?

350
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,916
[ANYA] That's the same
date when the academy holds its

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Battle Festival.
That is when you'll choose.

352
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,500
It's either Meme. Or it's me.

353
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,958
Until then, we'll keep
switching off, day by day.

354
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,166
I, okay...I understand.

355
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,541
And remember that weapon
and meister are two in one,

356
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,666
which means there's no
burden you have to carry alone.

357
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,250
Thank you, Meme.

358
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,208
You're getting
the jump on me again!

359
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,250
Oh no you don't!

360
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,666
[stomach growls]

361
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,750
Sounds like
someone's ready for dinner.

362
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,625
After all this bother, I think
you should cook for us tonight.

363
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,750
Okay.

364
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,333
[MEME] That sounds
great. I'll give you a hand.

365
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,708
[ANYA] Ah! In that case,
I'll give you a hand, too!

366
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,166
[TSUGUMI] All right,
then, what's up next on

367
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,083
Soul Eater Not?

368
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,166
[ANYA] Sweltering Nights!

369
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,083
[MEME] Oblivious!

370
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,458
[ANYA] Three-man Baseball!

371
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,750
[TSUGUMI] From Death
City with Love! Four stories!

372
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,791
[MEME] Hey, did you
know pumpkins grow better

373
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,000
when you sing to them?

374
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,500
[ANYA] What?
Now that is gagantous!
