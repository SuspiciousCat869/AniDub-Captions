[CABBIE] What?

67
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,208
The staircase
at the school's entrance

68
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,958
is famed for its enormous size.

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,958
Climbing it offers
students a daily workout.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,541
I'll never make it.
I'll die on the way up.

It's so hot!

72
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,125
They should tell you to
bring some water with you.

73
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,458
It's just a
little farther now.

of the students here.

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,958
Okay!

give out any second.

losing my mind.

it here after all.

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,916
My new school and my new home.

00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,500
It tastes like America!

Death Weapon
Meister Academy,

98
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,041
commonly known as the DWMA.

99
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,208
The school that trains heroes

100
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,291
to protect the world
and preserve peace.

101
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,666
Its students fall
into two categories.

102
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,083
First, there are the students

103
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,375
who possess the ability to
transform into weapons...

104
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,166
and then there are the meisters,

105
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,333
the students who wield
those weapons in battle.

106
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,500
[OX] That last
combination worked pretty well.

107
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,791
What do you think?

108
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,666
[HARVAR] We should
probably try it again soon.

109
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,083
I don't want to forget it.

110
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,750
[OX] Yeah. I'm sure we can
still tweak it a bit, too.

111
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,208
That guy was
talking to his spear.

112
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,416
The weapon is really a person.

113
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,083
I'm not gonna keep
any of the money I earn

114
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,000
from this latest
promotional event.

115
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,291
Every last dime of
it is going to charity.

116
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,291
Who is that guy?

117
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,583
I guess he must be famous.

118
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,125
And I will be donating

119
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,958
all my contract fees
to children in need.

120
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,541
You're so generous.

121
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,750
Would you consider
being my partner?

122
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,000
No. You should be my partner!

123
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,583
I'm a teenage girl
who's in love with love.

124
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,666
I've never even had a
guy who was a friend before,

125
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,833
and now suddenly I'm
part of a love triangle.

126
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,666
[BLACK STAR] Not you!

127
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,000
Not in a hundred years, punk!

128
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,083
[screams]

129
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,500
Watch yourself.

130
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,375
Sorry! Daydreaming!

131
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,458
I'll just get out
of your way now! Bye!

132
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,666
What was that?

133
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,208
I haven't
seen her around.

134
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,250
She's probably a freshman.

135
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,666
I'll bet
she came here hoping

136
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,708
for my autograph.

137
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,750
Somehow I doubt it.

138
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,458
I can already tell
this isn't going to be easy.

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,083
Why me?

140
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,500
Why do I have to be a weapon?

141
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,666
I wanna go home.

142
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,375
I wanna go home!

143
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,541
I wanna go home!
I wanna go home!

144
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,291
I wanna go home!

145
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,333
But I can't go home!

146
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,208
Better.

147
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:26,208
The halls here are
like some impossible maze.

148
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,375
Yep, I'm lost.

149
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,583
I managed to get away
from that cramped castle.

150
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,083
I was hoping I would
see the "real world,"

151
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,250
but I'm not certain
I chose the right place.

152
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,333
[ANYA] As a specialized school,

153
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,125
this academy doesn't
seem to be indicative

154
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,833
of the type of life
commoners generally lead.

155
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,166
I should have
researched more thoroughly.

156
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,625
[ANYA] The students here are far

157
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,250
from what one would call normal.

158
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,833
I found it! Finally!

159
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,833
Sorry I'm late!

160
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,625
The halls are so confusing here!

161
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,541
You're a new student?

162
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,541
Yes, that's right.

163
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,916
Tsugumi Harudori.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,458
An authentic commoner!

00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,750
Her hairstyle
is unassuming.

166
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,083
She has no figure to speak of

167
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,333
and despite her utter
lack of poise or charisma,

168
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,500
she has a sweetly
unconcerned blank smile.

169
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,291
[PUNK WEAPON ] Looks
like we just made it.

170
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,416
Ooh, squishy!

171
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,791
So comfortable! I'm so sorry!

172
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,958
Are you okay?

173
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,041
Don't worry.

174
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,916
It was just a
little fall. I'm fine.

175
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,541
[TSUGUMI] Oh, your ribbon.

176
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,625
Here you go.

177
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,791
Great, thank you.

178
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,000
Why did you
decide to change it?

179
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,958
You had it on
your left side before.

180
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,666
Oh, did I? I forgot.

181
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,083
Nice to meet you.

182
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm Tsugumi Harudori.

183

[MEME] "Tsugumi."
That's a pretty name.

184
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,583
It means "Spring Bird," right?

185
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,833
That's right.

186
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,791
As for me.

187
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,291
Let me think. Um...

188
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,958
I thought I knew
it, but I guess I forgot.

189
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,750
Huh?
Your name? Really?

190
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,750
Ah! That's it!

191
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,791
I've got it! My name's Meme.

192

Meme Tatane.

193
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,708
It's nice to meet you.

194
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,708
[TSUGUMI] I'm sorry for
asking this, but how could

195
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,666
anybody possibly...

196
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,833
Perfect.

197
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,916
That's the type of
girl I came here to see.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,083
Scatter-brained, huh?

199
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,875
Wow! That girl
is really pretty!

200
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,041
Almost like a princess.

201
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,625
Gagantous!

202
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,208
[MEME] "Gagantous"?

203
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,833
All right,
that should be everybody.

204
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,708
Welcome to DWMA.

205
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm Sid, one of
the teachers here.

206
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,666
Some of you can
transform into weapons.

207
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,250
And some of you
wish to be meisters,

208
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,416
those who fight
with the weapons.

209
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,083
Your skills likely vary.

210
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,291
Some of you weapons may not yet
be able to transform at will.

211
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,125
Don't worry, there's no rush.

212
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,375
That's why we're
here, to teach you.

213
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,666
[PUNK WEAPON]
Are you serious, man?

214
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,666
You let people like that in?

215
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,125
[SID] Beginning today,
you will fight as partners.

216
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,416
Matching up is simple.

217
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,958
Every weapon
needs to have a meister.

218
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,375
So I need a partner?

219
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,833
[SID] If you're still a
relatively inexperienced weapon,

220
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,916
the meister you partner with
will be especially important.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,625
Having a partner should
help the learning process.

222
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,041
Many weapons find it difficult

223
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,791
to transform unless they
have a meister to wield them.

224
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,916
Take your time and find

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,416
a partner you have
good chemistry with.

226
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,875
[PUNK MEISTER]
How should we play this?

227
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,833
[PUNK WEAPON] Don't know
about you, but I want a girl.

228
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,833
Far as I'm concerned,
the ideal partner is someone

229
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,958
who'll clean up
after me, tend my wounds,

230
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,916
and you know, other things.

231
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,958
I'm not a particularly
eloquent man,

232
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,416
and in this case,
I think showing will

233
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,125
be a lot more
helpful than telling.

234
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,791
You'll understand
better if you see partners

235
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,583
who have matching wavelengths.

236
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,708
You can come in now.

237
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,625
[SID] These are two
senior students here,

238
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,291
the meister Maka Albarn,
and the weapon Soul Eater.

239
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,666
Always good
to see new students.

240
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,041
Nice to meet you.

241
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,041
She actually
remembers me!

242
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,583
Go ahead and
begin the demonstration now.

243
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,541
What a smooth
transformation!

244
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,791
You're a weapon,
too, aren't you?

245
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,000
Is that how you do it?

246
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,500
Uh... Not really.

247
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,250
It's not that easy for me.

248
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,708
[SID] It's important to
remember that the weapon

249
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,500
and the mesiter are both people.

250
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,291
That scythe isn't a thing.

251
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,083
If we acknowledge
each other's wills

252
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,291
and synch our wavelengths,

253
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,041
fighting together's
natural as breathing.

254
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,083
Just watch.

255
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,541
They're incredible!

256
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,625
It's like they're
dancing together or something.

257
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,791
So, that's what a weapon

258
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,750
and meister pair looks like.

259
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,916
I hope this helped.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,125
You'll learn more
as class progresses,

261
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,833
but for now it's best if
you try to listen to your gut.

262
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,041
[SID] That's all for today.

263
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,500
Class dismissed.

264
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,125
That was really neat, huh?

265
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,375
From what I've seen so far,

266
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,000
the upperclassmen here
seem to be pretty cool.

267
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,041
They totally--

268
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,083

269
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,416
[PUNK WEAPON]
Hey, baby.

270
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,916
You're a meister, aren't ya?

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,250
How about partnering up with me?

272
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,083
It's hard to tell when
I'm not transformed,

273
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,083
but I make a fine
lookin' weapon.

274
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,416
[MEME] Well, uh...

275
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,333
Hey, what're you
starin' at, space cadet?

276
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm just
standing not staring.

277
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,375
I guess you're good enough.

278
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,708
You wanna be partners?

279
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,875
Not at all.

280
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,375
I can't do this.

281
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,291
I want to go to a regular
school like I always have.

282
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,958
Like the normal teenagers do.

283
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,625
Just because
I'm at the DWMA

284
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,500
doesn't mean I'm
suddenly a hero.

285
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,958
That girl Meme
did seem kinda nice.

286
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,750
And if I walk away
and quit like I want to,

287
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,458
I'll never have the chance to
get to know her better, will I?

288
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,875
Maybe if I
think about her.

289
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,333
What would Maka do
in this situation?

290
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,375
Aw, come on. There's
no reason to be shy.

291
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,583
You wanna be my partner? Huh?

292
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,958
No, but thanks.

You're breaking my
heart, here, baby.

294
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,375
What's the harm in getting to
know each other a bit better?

to be with her and
not you? That's pathetic.

Who'd want someone with
a chest like that, anyway?

It's a lost cause.

You're gonna be puny
forever, I can tell.

I do not wish to dance.

full transformation.

00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,083
I don't really have
the hang of it yet.

326
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,000
[PUNK WEAPON]
If you can't even do that much,

327
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,750
then why are you here
in the first place?

328
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,041
Come on!

329
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,791
Let's hang back
and watch for now.

330
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,208
We're just settling
into these roles.

331
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,083
There's no need to rush things.

332
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,208
What are those kids up to?

333
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,750
Trouble already?

334
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,166
Well, I guess it is
that kind of school, huh?

335
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,416
You're not
going to do anything?

336
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,041
But you're an instructor.

337
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,208
Nah. Like I said,
it's that kind of school.

338
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,375
This fight's gonna be
over before we even get started.

339
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,541
Here we go!

340
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,958
See that?

341
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,000
I can completely transform
everything but my head.

342
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,125
Not bad, huh?

343
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,875
So close.

344
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,250
You should really transform
sooner rather than later.

345
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,250
We're in danger of losing.

346
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,291
But I told
you, I can't.

347
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,291
Not when somebody puts
me on the spot like that.

348
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,625
[ANYA] How disappointing.

349
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,208
I heard about commoners.

350
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,375
You're supposed to be
a proud, hardy people.

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,666
But, that doesn't
seem to describe you.

352
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,833
Most unfortunate.

353
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,791
Looks like little girl
doesn't have a weapon.

354
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,708
I don't require one.

355
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,166
Weapon or not, I won't be
bullied by the likes of you.

356
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,166
[SID] Try to picture it!

357
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,333
Imagine the sharp blade that's
lying dormant within your soul.

358
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,000
Then awaken it!

359
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,000
Do battle for the sake of
what you know to be right.

360
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,041
You are a
student of the DWMA!

361
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,833
Just picture it?

362
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,333
There's some kind of blade
lying dormant within my soul?

363
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,833
Being a weapon wasn't
something I ever wanted.

364
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,041
Why did this happen to
me? I hate being afraid.

365
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,375
I want to go home.
I can't do this. I can't!

366
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,625
Please just leave me alone!

367
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,750
Think, Tsugumi.
Why are you really here?

368
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,833
I'm here to learn.
I'm here to fight.

369
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,500
Okay, then.
Open your eyes.

370
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,625
You can't fight like that.

371
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,375
Always remember,
you are a weapon!

372
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,416
I did it! Is this me?

373
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,083
The new
girl is a halberd.

374
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,333
She just needed
to believe in herself.

375
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,375
One problem.
You've got no blade.

376
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,416
[TSUGUMI] I'm sorry
it took me so long.

377
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,500
Let's begin.

378
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,500
Keep calm, okay?

379
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,958
[TSUGUMI] Right!

380
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,500
The first
injuries of the year.

381
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,291
I need one of you get
to the nurse's office

382
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,333
and ask Medusa
to come down here.

383
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,375
Yeah, no problem. I'll go.

384
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,708
Thanks, Tsunami Hunky-Dory!
That guy was a mega jerk!

385
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,625
It's Tsugumi Harudori.

386
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,500
Oh... Of course,
that's right! I'm sorry.

387
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,916
Anyway, I couldn't
have done anything at all

388
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,208
if I didn't have help. If
you want to thank anyone.

389
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,166
My name is Anya.

390
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,375
[BOTH] Thank you
for everything, Anya.

391
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,083
You were fantastic!

392
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,250
Hmph.

393
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,708
Harudori, I
wanted to ask a favor.

394
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,291
Yeah?

395
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,041
I'm the most
forgetful person ever,

396
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,375
and I realize I might be
more trouble than I'm worth,

397
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,291
but I was wondering
if you'd consider being

398
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,416
my partner anyway.

399
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,791
Huh? Me? Really?

400
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, if you mean it,
that sounds perfect! Oh!

401
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,291
But what about...

402
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,625
Commoners are interesting to
observe, but that certainly

403
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,541
doesn't mean I want
to partner with one.

404
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,291
Quite the opposite, in fact.

405
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,916
What if your abnormally flat-
chested condition is contagious?

406
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,291
Unacceptable!

407
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,833
Gagantous!

408
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,750
Okay, is that settled, then?

409
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,708
It sure is. Glad to have you!

410
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,750
[MEME] This is gonna be great!

411
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm a teenage girl
who's in love with love,

412
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,666
but this isn't exactly
the kind of triangle

413
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,625
I expected to
find myself a part of.

414
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,208
[TSUGUMI] What dangers await
us at the girls' dorm?

415
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,500
Witches? Misfortune?

416
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,583
Hey! I'm not Mary!

417
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,916
Go away! Leave me alone!

418
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,708
[ANYA] What are you babbling
about now, Tsugumi?

419
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,208
[MEME] It's time to find a job!

420
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,583
[TSUGUMI]
A job? But why?
