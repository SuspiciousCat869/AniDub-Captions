[ANYA'S BUTLER]
I have today's schedule

2
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,708
for your review.

3
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,458
Following breakfast,
from nine hour until

4
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,083
eleven hour, will be
liberal arts. The subjects

5
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,500
for today will be
mathematics and geography.

6
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,666
Next, from eleven
until twelve, will be

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,166
royal economics, and then
there is a change of clothing

8
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,125
which will be followed
by a state dinner at 12:30.

9
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:01,083
From 15:00 until 17:00 is
your royal karate training.

10
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,000
Wake up, Anya.

11
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,875
Are you with us, Anya Hepburn?

12
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,666
You know, you're actually pretty
adorable when you're asleep.

13
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,916
I wasn't sleeping!
I was just sitting there,

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,291
thinking with my eyes
closed, that's all, but I was

15
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,583
still wide awake. I heard
everything you were saying.

16
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,666
Okay you three,
if you'll follow me,

17
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,083
I'll show you to
the girls' dorm.

18
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,083
Oh, wow!
That's such a beautiful

19
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,291
brooch you've got on.

20
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,416
Hmm?

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,916
Oh. Yes,
it's my family crest.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,041
Whoa!
Your family's got a crest?

23
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,750
Well. It's our custom
to wear it at all times,

24
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,000
so I put it on by habit.

25
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,583
If you've
got a crest like that,

26
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,166
you must be from a
real high-class family!

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,916
Well, I'm not!
Honestly, sometimes

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,833
I think you are just too common.

29
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,833
It is rather disappointing.

30
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,666
Gagantous! Ah!

31
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,916
[TSUGUMI] Um, excuse me?

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,625
My name's Eternal Feather.

33
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,375
Oh, well, do we have
much farther to walk?

34
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,000
Not at all. Once we pass through

35
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,500
the market ahead,
we're almost there.

36
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,166
Tsugumi, I'm all turned around.

37
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,041
Could you remind me where
we're headed again? I forgot.

38
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,000
Um, we're going
to the girls' dorm,

39
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,833
where we'll be
living from now on.

40
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,625
Oh, yeah!
That makes sense! Silly me!

41
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,291
[TSUGUMI]
"Silly" doesn't quite cover it.

42
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,125
Not a bad little town,
don't you think, Anya?

43
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,250
I suppose it's sufficient.
I can't imagine

44
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,208
the likes of you
would need anything more.

45
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,458
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Now, then, the allowance

46
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,791
the school just gave you
has to last for a full week.

47
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,458
You'll be more than a
little sorry if you squander it.

48
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,750
Those funds are what you'll

49
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,291
use to pay for your
meals and any other daily

50
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,250
necessities, so
spend them wisely.

51
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,541
Even if you
account for meals and

52
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,458
whatever else, this
is way more allowance than

53
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,166
I got at home. I feel rich!

54
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,875
Keep in mind there
aren't any advances.

55
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,208
So if you somehow manage
to spend all your money between

56
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,791
now and tomorrow, you'll have
to get a job and earn your own.

57
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,375
It's either that or go hungry.

58
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:50,333
A real job?
Like, where they pay you?

59
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,000
I wouldn't even
know where to start looking.

60
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,333
I've never had a job
before. I don't know if

61
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,708
I'm really old enough for one.

62
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,375
Oh, yeah? Me too.

63
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,958
I was wondering
how old you were.

64
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,083
I'm 14.

65
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,208
Oh! Then
we're the same!

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,041
And different.

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,375
As it happens,
I'm fourteen, too.

68
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah?

Students' ages frequently vary

at this school, even
within the same class.

Uh-huh!

you guys think? Isn't it great?

I must admit
that I am surprised.

77
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,250
I was expecting
something much more modest.

78

One more thing
before we go in.

Something very
important that you should

all keep in mind.

Watch out for the witch
of the girls' dormitory.

All right, welcome to your
new home away from home!

A witch at the DWMA?
Preposterous.

00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,375
It would be a lot like having
a cat live in a dog kennel.

of our meeting,

Cool.

The reading is
ready. It's not good.

Looks like you'd better
be careful here, new girl.

96
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,791
Hey, uh, do you think
you could be more specific?

Take a deep breath, Anya.
Come on. Let's go.

a specific shampoo or lotion

for buying that yourself.

00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,500
[MEME]
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,875
[TSUGUMI]
Do you really think so?

160
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,333
[MEME]
Well, I just said so, didn't I?

161
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,458
[TSUGUMI]
Yeah, but are you sure?

162
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,083
I'm turning off
the lights, okay?

163
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,333
Yeah. I'm all
ready for bed.

164
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,458
[TSUGUMI]
Good night. Sleep well.

165
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,666
[WOMAN] She lay down
on the cold stone floor.

166
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,041
Mary thought to herself. "It
was wrong for a commoner like me

167
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:14,000
to dream such grand
dreams, wasn't it?" And now,

168
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,833
the warmth of Nyaro, purring
in her arms, was the only

169
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,833
thing Mary
could call her own.

170
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,083
Her only comfort in
a cold, cruel world.

171
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,500
Huh? Misery?

172
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,041
What is this?

173
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,541
You know this
novel, don't you?

174
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,250
The Commoner of Flanders.
You, my dear, are exactly how

175
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,375
I've always imagined
the main character Mary Smith

176
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,000
would look if she was alive.

177
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,208
I'm sorry. I don't
understand what you're saying.

178
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,125
I will groom you.
By the time we're done,

179
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,750
you'll be the perfect
Mary, straight out of the book.

180
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,916
You're
the housemaster!

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You can't be the
witch of the girls' dorm!

182
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,666
Unfortunately, I think that nose

183
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,500
of yours is a bit
longer than Mary's.

184
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,125
Don't worry,
though. I can fix it.

185
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,708
Great timing, Meme! Help me!

186
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,041
[TSUGUMI] Huh? She's asleep?

187
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,166
There, be a good
girl now, and go back to bed.

188
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,708
She's still sleeping?
Drunken boxing!

189
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,375
Uh, what're you doing?

190
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,583
No, that's wrong. Mary
doesn't need any new friends.

191
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,625
Meme, now would
be a great time to wake up!

192
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,041
Come on, Meme! You can do it!

193
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,000
Although, maybe
you fight better

194
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,583
when you're asleep, huh?

195
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,708
Okay, then. Stay
asleep, but keep fighting!

196
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,916
I get that you're new,
but do you have to be so loud?

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,125
I was sleeping.

198
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,875
If you wanna make
it here, you have to get

199
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,541
along with the housemaster,
even if she is a raging psycho.

200
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,125
Did that actually just happen?

201
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,541
Good morning.
How did you two slee--

202
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,291
Is that the sort
of thing they get up to

203
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,750
when I'm not looking? Trollops!

204
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,333
[yawn]

205
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,625
Thank you so much
for helping like you did

206
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,333
last night! I would've
been dead without you!

207
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,875
Can I ask what your name is?

208
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,916
Pay up.

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,375
I'm sorry?

210
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,958
You'd be dead if
I didn't help, right?

211
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,750
Doesn't that mean you owe me?

212
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,875
Your entire school
allowance for the week.

213
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,125
I think that's a pretty
fair amount, don't you?

214
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,208
Hurry up already.

215
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,250
Okay.

216
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,083
She's at it again!
It's the witch

217
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,500
of the girls' dorm!

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,750
I'll leave you a little
something so you can eat today.

219
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,208
Uh, thank you.

220
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,125
So scary! Whenever she talks,
it makes my skin crawl.

221
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,208
Okay, see you later.

222
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,750
I wanna go home.
Back to my mom and my dog.

223
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
I guess I'll have to
borrow some money from

224
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,375
Meme and Anya to get
me through the week.

225
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,916
Good thing
I have friends to help

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,833
or I'd be in real trouble.
Huh? What is this thing?

227
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,875
That's Josephine.
Isn't she just beautiful?

228
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,833
She's lovely.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,791
I went into town this morning
and bought some new things.

230
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,791
 All of this
stuff? Let me guess.

231
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,166
You used your
allowance to buy it?

232
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,208
[MEME] Hey, Tsugumi.
You know that envelope

233
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,875
of money Infinite Plume gave
us? Do you know where mine is?

234
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,291
I can't seem to
remember where I put it.

235
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,750
Well, it's not like
it's a whole lot of money,

236
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,208
right? I wouldn't
worry too much.

237
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,750
Yeah, you're right. We get
more every week, don't we?

238
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,083
You pop the top like this.

239
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:23,666
[MEME] Huh?

240
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,708
[ANYA] Pop! Pop!

241
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,458
Oh, hey, you're
brooch is missing.

242
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,625
Did you know?

243
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,958
Huh? Oh, it was
very clumsy of me.

244
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,541
I lost it somewhere
when I was out this morning.

245
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,208
It was such a
pretty piece of jewelry.

246
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,958
You must be sad that it's gone!

247
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,875
No, it's okay. I think I'll
fit in better here at the school

248
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,291
without it.

249
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,208
And, besides.
I don't need a brooch

250
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,083
when I have Josephine!

251
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,875
Yeah, why would you?

252
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,666
[TSUGUMI] Excuse me, an
order of noodles, please.

253
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,166
[COOK] You mean
three orders, right?

254
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,541
No, thanks. Just the one!

255
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,375
Everybody dig in.

256
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,791
It looks tasty, at least.

257
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,958
This reminds me of consommé,

258
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,416
but with some sort
of pasta added to it.

259
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,583
Doesn't stretch
very far, does it?

260
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,000
This isn't gonna work.

261
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,250
We have to find a
way to buy food until

262
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,208
next week's allowance.

263
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,125
So we're
getting jobs then?

264
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,500
We have no choice.

265
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,083
Yeah, you're right.

266
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,250
We'll pick something
that'll pay us every day.

267
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,625
A job. How quaint!

268
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,791
[MEME] Hey, look!
This one pays really well.

269
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,958
[TSUGUMI] It does, but I'm
not sure about manual labor.

270
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,875
We're girls, after all.

271
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,791
[TSUGUMI] Hey, Anya.

272
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,583
Is there any kind
of job that sounds good to you?

273
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,625
Well, menial labor is out of the
question for me, obviously.

274
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,250
In fact, I really
shouldn't work at all,

275
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,791
but I can accompany you,
I suppose. And I want

276
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,666
to make it clear that I have
no interest in cute uniforms.

277
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,083
Ooh! Uniforms, huh?

278
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,583
How about this one, here?
Working at a café.

279
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,416
Uniforms provided.
No experience necessary.

280
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,583
[TSUGUMI] "An ideal
job for female students,"

281
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,833
What about Deathbucks Café?

282
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,291
It's the little ladies. 

283
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,041
Apparently they've all
applied to work there.

284
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,750
Our job is to
look out for them so does

285
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,375
that mean we have to
work at the café, too?

286
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,500
I guess there is one
other option available.

287
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,791
We could go drink
coffee there every day.

288
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,625
You know what? You're
enjoying this too much.

289
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,375
I still don't see
why I have to get a job.

290
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,583
Oh so, you've forgotten why
we're doing this, too, Anya?

291
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,541
Forgotten? Huh? 

292
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,916
You don't remember
why we came down here?

293
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,708
According to the map,
it should be nearby.

294
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,166
[TSUGUMI] Is this it?

295
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,750
[MEME] Wow, it looks
really chic, doesn't it?

296
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,958
[TSUGUMI] Excuse us!

297
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,958
We're the ones who contacted
you about temporary work.

298
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,083
Yes, of course. I remember.

299
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,000
There were five of
you, weren't there?

300
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,250
Five?

301
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,208
Hey, girls.

302
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,791
Hey, how's it going?

303
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,291
Oh, we saw you
at orientation, didn't we?

304
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,625
Name's Clay. I'm a weapon.

305
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,458
I'm Akane. I'm a meister.

306
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,875
Are you guys
looking for work because

307
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,041
you ran out of
allowance money, too?

308
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,333
Yes. Unfortunately,

309
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,000
my friend here used
it all up at the arcade.

310
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,333
Hey!

311
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,708
[ANYA] It goes very
quickly, doesn't it?

312
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,583
[TSUGUMI] I've gotta
say, I'm a little nervous

313
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,375
about the idea
of working with boys.

314
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,416
[MEME] Yeah, so am I.

315
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,750
[TSUGUMI] How old
do you think they are?

316
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,458
Older than us, right?

317
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,125
The uniform looks
a whole lot different on you.

318
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,750
Your chest is
so, well, you know.

319
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,958
Yeah, I guess
it is a little tight.

320
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,666
 It looks good, though.

321
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,708
There's something so
motivating about putting on

322
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,583
a uniform, you know?

323
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,041
You're a simple man, aren't you?

324
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,125
I suppose those vests
look sharp enough on you two.

325
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,875
Okay, Anya,
it's time to get to work.

326
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,833
Come on. What are
you waiting for?

327
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,541
[ANYA]
Just give me another moment.

328
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,000
I can't possibly wear
a skirt as short as this.

329
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,958
Please. You'll be fine.

330
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,041
I feel like I'm on display.

331
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,166
You have such
lovely, slender legs.

332
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,208
Why not show them off a little?

333
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,625
I'm a lady.

334
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,833
How precious!

335
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,041
She's so adorable,
I almost can't handle it.

336
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,333
If you ladies are ready,
shall we get started?

337
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,833
Most of our customers
will be coming here because

338
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,125
they want to get
a look at real, live DWMA

339
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,083
students like you. So, just
put your best foot forward

340
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,416
and you should do fine.
Now let's get to work.

341
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,875
[ALL] Right!

342
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,875
Hi, welcome to Deathbucks!

343
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,291
Are you new here?

344
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,958
Uh, yes, ma'am.

345
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,041
Good luck, then.

346
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,541
Oh, thanks.
That's so nice of you to say!

347
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,208
Are you sure you're okay?

348
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,958
Yeah, just don't talk
to me. I'm concentrating.

349
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,500
A ham sandwich,
bacon, eggs, toast,

350
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,625
a cup of hot coffee,
and an iced coffee, please.

351
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,750
Add on some
french fries, too.

352
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,500
[MEME] Ham eggs.

353
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,583
[BOTH] In a sandwich!

354
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,625
[MEME] Would you mind starting
over from the beginning?

355
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,541
This is the third
time we've repeated it.

356
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,083
Think those two are okay?
They're having a rough time.

357
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,958
Thank you for
your patience. Here's your

358
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,083
iced lemon tea. I
hope you enjoy it!

359
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,708
Another order, Master!

360
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,416
I need two more
iced coffees, please!

361
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,541
[MASTER] Coming up.

362
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,416
Welcome to Deathbucks Café!

363
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,666
She's really into
this, isn't she?

364
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,250
So has she secretly
been a nice person all along?

365
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,500
With her I'm guessing
it depends on the day.

366
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,833
Just one more thing
that makes her cute!

367
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,000
[MASTER] Your order is
ready. Come and get it.

368
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,625
Great, thanks. Come
on. We can do this!

369
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay!

370
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,208
[TSUGUMI] One hot coffee. We'll
have that right out for you!

371
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,375
Thank you for
waiting. Your café au lait

372
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,916
and raspberry juice.

373
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,875
And twenty
cents is your change.

374
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,125
Have a lovely day!

375
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,375
Thank you for stopping by.

376
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,125
We look forward to
seeing you again sometime soon!

377
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,375
Hello! I'm back!

378
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,041
I thought it would be
nice if I bought us a little

379
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,125
treat with today's pay. No need
to make a big to-do about it,

380
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,666
though. Would you like some?

381
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,708
 Uh-oh! There
you go, splurging again.

382
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,541
Wow! These are
about as fresh as they come!

383
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,583
Don't mind if I do!

384
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,041
 It's so good!

385
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,833
Do it now.

386
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,875
Actually, we
bought something with

387
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,458
the money we got today, too.

388
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,875
To commemorate our
first day at work. Go on.

389
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,458
We wanted you to have something.

390
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,291
I'm sure
it won't take the place

391
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,333
of the brooch you lost,
but we hope you like it!

392
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,916
[TSUGUMI] So...
what do you think?

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,333
It's all right,
I guess, and since I lost my

394
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,000
other one, I'll wear it.

395
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,583
Oh, yeah! I wanted
to run something by you two.

396
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,000
Sure. What is it?

397
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,416
A lot of friends
have nicknames for each other,

398
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,666
don't they? Choose one for me!

399
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,666
Yeah? You
trust us to come up

400
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,541
with a nickname for you?

401
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,583
Of course I do!

402
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,500
I'm sure it'll
be the perfect one!

403
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,375
Well give me
a sec to think, okay?

404
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,583
[TSUGUMI]
All right, but just a sec!

405
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,666
Any ideas, Anya?

406
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,416
Me?

407
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,750
Yep!

408
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:39,791
Okay. A nickname,
huh? Well, maybe Tsu-mi.

409
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,750
[BOTH] Huh?

410
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,666
[NARRATOR]
That's not gonna work.

411
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,375
"Sue me"?

412
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,541
[ANYA] These commoners
lead such exciting lives!

413
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,750
Their existence isn't
without peril, however.

414
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,791
It's a good thing I know
royal karate. 

415
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,166
[MEME] This is fun,
isn't it, Tsugumi?

416
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,291
[TSUGUMI]
Yeah, I'm having a great time!

417
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,875
[ANYA]
Must you get so cozy together?
