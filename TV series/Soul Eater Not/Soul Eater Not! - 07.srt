1
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,541
[SHAULA] The time
will be at hand very soon.

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,458
For now, you need
only continue to slumber.

3
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,708
Gather your
strength for what is to come,

4
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,833
for the day
when we release our fury.

5
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,166
[SID]
Nice work, guys.

6
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,291
So, if there's a witch
directing things behind the

7
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,416
scenes, you're guessing
it's one of these three?

8
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,875
That's right.

9
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,833
The recent Traitor attacks
have all been perpetrated by

10
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,666
what were
previously law-abiding citizens.

11
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,291
[CLAY] That suggests not
only the involvement of a witch,

12
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,500
but one who is specifically
skilled in mind control.

13
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,250
And what about
this witch, Arachne?

14
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,958
What have you
singled her out for?

15
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,833
[CLAY] She is skilled in
the creation of Magic Tools.

16
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,333
She appears to
have developed some

17
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,000
that would
facilitate brainwashing.

18
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,958
We did look into
her, but it seems she died

19
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,083
eight hundred years ago.

20
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,875
[CLAY] We should also
note that all of the Traitors

21
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,583
display the
peculiarity of not sleeping.

22
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,125
Sleep deprivation seems to
decrease their inhibitions and

23
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,041
fear response. The witch
has the additional perk of

24
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,208
a fighting
force that never rests.

25
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,333
[CLAY] The suspects
aren't necessarily gifted in

26
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,625
the martial arts. We
think their abilities are being

27
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,041
expanded using
unconventional means.

28
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,750
Our best theory
is that some sort of

29
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,125
special doping
is being used on them.

30
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,583
Sid, they're perfect soldiers.

31
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,458
So, after coming
to these conclusions,

32
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,083
you did
additional research and

33
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,958
narrowed it down to a
primary suspect. Shaula Gorgon.

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,166
[CLAY] It's all
conjecture, but yes.

35
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,000
Witches are devious.

36
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,000
It's all well and good
to identify one. But tracking

37
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,708
her down will
be the hardest part.

38
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,375
[SID] Regardless, I'm
impressed with the progress

39
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,166
you've made. A witch's record
is never easy to piece together,

40
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
in no small part because
they stretch back for centuries.

41
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,833
You two have displayed
some serious analytical skill.

42
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,875
We could use
more people like you

43
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,208
here at Central Intelligence.

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,500
Aw, shucks, boss.

45
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,000
Qucik. What's one plus one?

46
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,625
Eh? Why are you asking me?
Okay. Let's see here. Ah! Two!

47
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,416
Haha, you can't fool me!

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,541
Not quite ready for
Central Intelligence yet.

49
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,083
Oh, leave me alone.

50
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,083
Well, you're a team, aren't
you? Which means you'll be there

51
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,000
to support him
when he struggles, Akane.

52
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,125
Meister and weapon
are one. You know that.

53
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,416
[ANYA] Of course!
We deserve to get lost

54
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,583
for going the way
that Meme suggested!

55
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,041
Well, for what it's
worth, you were the one

56
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,291
who said we should take a
shortcut in the first place.

57
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,708
It would help if
somebody hadn't forgotten

58
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,291
to bring her
textbook to the study session.

59
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,458
It just means more
time together! Right?

60
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,708
We'll call it a
"long-cut." What do you think?

61
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,291
I'm sick of being
lost. I'm going this way.

62
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,375
And you're coming
with me, right, Tsugumi?

63
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,625
Uh.

64
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,166
Yeah, well I think
this way is our best bet.

65
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,833
Don't you, Tsugumi?

66
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:12,125
Well, uh. Let me see.
Which way should we go?

67
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:12,875
Well?

68
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,250
[TSUGUMI] Ah!
Look, there's a room!

69
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,375
Maybe someone
in there can help us!

70
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,125
[knocking]

71
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,375
[CLAY]
Yes?

72
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,708
We're sorry for bothering you.

73
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,041
Oh, hello!

74
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,541
Hey.

75
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,541
[TSUGUMI] Uh, hi. We didn't
expect to run into you guys.

76
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,125
Oh, uh, yeah. Well,
you know how it goes. We just...

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,833
We had a thing to do and there
was some stuff and you know.

78
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,166
Sid couldn't get away,
and he asked if we'd

79
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,833
pick up some snacks for him.

80
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,791
Thanks for this,
guys. I appreciate it.

81
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,333
It was nice of you to do that.

82
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,250
Yes! We're very nice.

83
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,958
Anyway, what brings
you lovely ladies down here?

84
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,333
We were actually
trying to get back to

85
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,458
the classroom to pick
up something we left behind,

86
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,541
but we got a little lost.

87
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,916
The DWMA is built like a maze.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,041
The better to keep
its deep, dark secrets.

89
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,291
[ANYA] It's all
Tsugumi's fault.

90
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,250
This would never have happened
if she could choose a route.

91
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,125
Or a partner, for that matter.

92
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,625
I actually have to
agree with her on this one.

93
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,208
You both feel that way?

94
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,500
[CLAY] Huh? You haven't
decided on a partner yet?

95
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,541
Well, that's a pretty unusual
situation you guys are in.

96
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,958
There are some
meisters with two weapons,

97
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,083
but I've never
heard of it the other way.

98
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,083
I think I understand
the problem you're having.

99
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,250
You're afraid
whichever way you choose,

100
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,958
somebody will end up hurt.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,541
That just means
you have a kind heart.

102
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,250
You aren't making
things better, Akane.

103
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,958
Being kind isn't going
to help her to decide, is it?

104
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,208
Here's a thought,
she could always choose

105
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,916
somebody besides you two.

106
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,958
[CLAY] Hey! You
guys are lost, right?

107
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,000
Why don't I help
you find your way?

108
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,833
Oh! That's right!

109
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,875
Our study session!

110
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,916
A little more.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,958
Where are all the customers?
I guess nobody wants to come in

112
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,000
and look at that sour
puss of yours, eh, Master?

113
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,041
If only you could tell
a joke, that might help.

114
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,041
[MASTER]
A joke, huh?

115
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,583
Long ago, my entire
family was massacred.

116
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,416
I have been unable to
laugh ever since that day.

117
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,041
Actually, I'm joking.

118
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,666
Worst joke ever!

119
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,708
You're right, I'm sorry.
Only my daughter was killed.

120
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,583
I'm joking again.
I never had any children.

121
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,333
Hello everybody!

122
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,625
[MASTER]
Hello, girls.

123
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,000
What's up? We saved
your usual seats for you.

124
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,208
[TSUGUMI] Wow!
Thank you so much!

125
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,125
From the looks
of this place, though,

126
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,958
there was no need for a
reservation. It's deserted.

127
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,708
No way! I don't wanna!
I don't wanna! I don't wanna!

128
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,125
You can't make me!

129
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,666
Come on! I dragged you
down here so we could work on

130
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,583
improving your grades. We're
not turning back now, got it?

131
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,208
Thanks again for letting
us look at your notes, Jackie.

132
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,416
I knew yours
would be well-organized

133
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,916
and easy to follow.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,666
Easy to follow,
are they? Which part?

135
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,791
Well, maybe if you stop
complaining and concentrate.

136
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,875
You're going to have
to memorize all of this.

137
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,750
You might as well get started.

138
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,208
How's it going?
Do you think you'll remember

139
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,458
everything you'll
need for the test, Meme?

140
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,000
Huh? There's going
to be a test on this?

141
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,375
What did you think the point
of today's study session was?

142
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,208
Oh. I guess I forgot.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,291
Well?

144
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,875
You know what you want
yet? We can take your order.

145
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,125
Yes, please.
I would like a royal milk tea.

146
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,625
An iced café au lait!

147
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,250
 A cappuccino for me, please.

148
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,000
One iced tea with lemon, please!

149
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,708
I'll have an iced café mocha.

150
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,333
Perfect we'll just bring
five of whatever we can find.

151
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,333
I thought that was over.

152
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,875
This isn't working at all.
I have to say, I'm disappointed.

153
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,000
I expected you to be a better
teacher than this, Jackie.

154
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,458
[KIM] But what can you do?
You just don't seem to have

155
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,083
a knack for it.
You're pretty bad, actually.

156
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,833
In that case, why don't
you have Ox tutor you instead?

157
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,333
Huh?

158
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,375
[JACQUELINE] I'm sure he'd
be more than glad to give you

159
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,083
all the help you
could possibly want.

160
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,291
Of course, I don't
think that'll help with

161
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,166
your discipline problem.

162
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,666
Fine, I get the point.
You're the best tutor ever.

163
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,666
Please keep helping me study.

164
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,250
What's with the
goofy look? Tell me.

165
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,458
Enjoy.

166
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,750
That is what all of
you ordered, isn't it?

167
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,458
I've gotten so good
at this lately I can tell

168
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,500
what a customer wants
just by looking at her face.

169
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,500
Pretty cool, huh?

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
[BLUE SHIRT YANKEE]
You wouldn't stand a chance.

171
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,125
Yeah?
Just watch me. I'll show you.

172
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,625
[GREEN SHIRT YANKEE]
I mean, seriously, none at all.

173
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,708
Hey, it was
close. I almost had it.

174
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,125
[GREEN SHIRT YANKEE]
Yeah, right!

175
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,083
You think you'll make it
into EAT with that kind of aim?

176
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,791
Shut up, you punk. There's
nothin' wrong with my aim.

177
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,166
What's with those jerks?

178
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,583
DWMA students.
Plenty of people develop some

179
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,083
skills in NOT
class and start thinking

180
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,125
they're ready for bigger things.

181
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,916
We shouldn't deal with
them right now. Later, maybe.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,500
You mind? You guys're
bothering the other customers.

183
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,833
Huh?

184
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,708
Yeah, well, we're
customers here too aren't, we?

185
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,333
Just keep it down, you idiot.

186
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,791
It would be a shame
to have to hurt you.

187
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,458
Huh? Oh you
think you can talk like

188
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,125
that just 'cause you're a girl?

189
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,625
Let's go, guys.

190
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,958
Hey, can I get some help here?

191
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,291
I'll be there
in a second! Hold on!

192
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,416
It's really filling up. They're
starting to look swamped.

193
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,875
Hey, I know!

194
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,541
[TSUGUMI] Master!
Why don't we give you a hand?

195
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,166
Does that mean we have
to wear the uniforms again?

196
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,916
[KIM]
Eh? You mean those?

197
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,791
What are you
daydreaming about, Jackie?

198
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,333
Actually, I kind of want
to try one on. Silly, huh?

199
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,125
I'm gonna pass.
What kind of back-of-house

200
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,333
work do you need,
Master? Oh and by the way,

201
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,083
I will expect to be paid.

202
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,000
[MASTER] Well, I guess
you could cut up some lemons.

203
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,833
Aw, you're not even
going to try on a uniform, Kim?

204
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,583
It would look
really cute on you.

205
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,291
Not happening. Now drop it.

206
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,583
This is
definitely still too short.

207
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,625
That's perfect! It
looks adorable on you.

208
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,250
Are you sure?

209
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,750
Yeah! So slender!

210
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,583
I guess so.
You are, too, you know.

211
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,791
Yes, but unfortunately,
I'm petite all over.

212
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,125
[TSUGUMI] Master!
You can put us to work now.

213
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,666
We're ready. What
would you like us to do first?

214
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,166
Whew! I'm exhausted.

215
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,541
I thought this'd happen.
We get rushes like that.

216
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,000
They don't tend to last long.

217
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,541
Huh?

218
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,333
You could have mentioned that
before we changed, you know!

219
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,458
But it's nice to see
you wearing those uniforms.

220
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,416
Reminds me of when
you three worked here.

221
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,583
We can still
have fun, can't we?

222
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,083
I suppose so. We can kill
time like we used to when

223
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,583
the place was dead like
this. Which was often enough.

224
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,333
It doesn't sound very
good when you put it that way.

225
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,791
It's better to say that
the café tends to have a nice,

226
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,166
relaxing atmosphere.

227
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,250
You guys hello, is anybody here?

228
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,125
Why, you dirty little brat!
I'll teach you to spy on me!

229
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,916
[humming]

230
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,250
It's the Death
Bazaar! The Death Bazaar!

231
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,750
[TSUGUMI]
What are we singing about?

232
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,916
The quaint local custom
known as the Death Bazaar.

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,416
Have you never heard of it?

234
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,083
Actually, I haven't.

235
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,833
Well, apparently
one is being held today.

236
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,250
It's in Death Pain
Square. From what I heard,

237
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,791
people set up
booths in the plaza

238
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,500
and bring in all
their old stuff to sell.

239
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,375
An interesting concept.

240
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,625
It sounds like you're
talking about a flea market.

241
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,166
Aw, yes, that's my Tsugumi!

242

You know about all the
poor people things, don't you?

243
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,041
I had a feeling you
would want to go with me.

244
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,083
Oh, well, no, not really.

245
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
I see. Okay.

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,250
Ah! Just kidding!
Actually, back home

247
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,083
I'm known as
the queen of flea markets, so.

248
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,583
I wouldn't miss
it for the world!

249
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,333
What could be better?
Let's go to the bazaar!

250
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,458
I knew you wouldn't let me down!

251
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,708
You don't fight fair.
You know that, right?

the lives of six evildoers!

It's yours for
only twenty-five dollars!

So this is a flea
market? It's fascinating!

Oh, yeah, flea markets
are always a real blast.

You don't understand! I didn't

want this stuff.

Hello there.

Hm, there's so much here,
but none of it really looks

00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,333
like anything I'd
want to buy, you know?

Oh!
Look at this!

Hi, Maka! How are you?

294
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,291
Oh, hey!

295

Hi.

00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,541
Wow, you're
selling a lot of books.

Take them.
Please take them all.

298
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,708
Oh, that was a good one. I
read it when I was just starting

same point that you're at

Yeah?
Maybe I should, too.

[MAKA]
So you enjoy reading, huh?

303
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,833
Yes, actually.

304
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,000
All right, then. You
should take that book with you.

What?
No, I couldn't, really!

306

It's no problem. Just promise
me you'll read it carefully.

Ugh, finally one of 'em's gone.

309
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,083
Hey, guys.
What are you up to?

310
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,500
Oh, there you are, Tsugumi.

311
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,250
Where have you
been this whole time?

312
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,041
Why's she grinning
like the village idiot?

313
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,041
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Brand new clothes for sale!

314
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,375
Somebody please buy my clothes.

315
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,916
Maybe it's time
to give up and go home.

316
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,333
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Wow.

317
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,416
[SHAULA]
Take a closer look.

318
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,166
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
I can see a lot of these have a

319
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,583
scorpion motif.

320
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,250
[SHAULA]
Yes.

321
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,208
[ETERNAL FEATHER] I'm a
Scorpio myself, and someday I'd

322
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,125
like to be a woman who can
beguile with a single bite.

323
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,416
Is that so? Then
I have just the ring for you.

324
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,000
It's beautiful!

325
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,375
[SHAULA] And the price
is more than reasonable.

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's settled. I'll take it!

327
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,583
Let's see how looks on. Here.

328
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,625
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Okay.

329
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,666
Ow!

330
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,166
Oh, dear. What is
it, miss? Are you all right?

331
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:20,333
I'm fine. I am.

332
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,041
Go to sleep child.
Give in to the venom.

333
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:35,125
Trust me. You will do as I
command and be my loyal servant.

334
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,416
The Death
Bazaar was a good idea.

335
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,416
I won't say "I told you so."

336
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,750
What should we
go check out next?

337
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,208
[screaming]

338

[MEME]
Tsugumi! Are you okay?

339
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,708
[ANYA] Eternal
Feather, what's going on?

340
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,625
No! She...

341
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,250
[MAKA] Your bag
won't hold! You need to dodge!

342
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,625
[MAKA]
What do you think you're doing?

343
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,583
You're a DWMA student, right?

344
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,125
Hey, watch out!

345
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,583
Back off. I'm not letting
you anywhere near my meister.

346
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,916
[TSUGUMI] I should have
been there to protect Anya like

347
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,333
Soul was for Maka.

348
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,166
Do you know this girl?

349
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,250
We do. She's an older
student in the NOT class.

350
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,166
Eternal Feather,
what's going on?

351
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It doesn't seem
like she can hear you.

352
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,291
Remember, she's a student.
We don't want her getting hurt.

353
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,500
You got it?
We can't attack blindly.

354
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,458
[SOUL]
Gotcha.

355
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,916
[MAKA] Don't resist! We
don't want to hurt you, okay?

356
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,500
Please Eternal Feather! Whatever
it is, we can talk about it!

357
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,666
We just want to help you!

358
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,166
Much more of this
and someone will get hurt.

359
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,583
We need to subdue her,
and quickly. Let's go!

360
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,791
[MALE ONLOOKER] Good thing
there was an EAT pair nearby.

361
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,333
[MALE SPECTATOR] They can handle
a single weapon with no problem.

362
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,041
It's true, such a
small amount of venom won't be

363
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,666
enough to allow
her to hold her own

364
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
against an EAT
meister and weapon.

365
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,250
[SHAULA] But it's worth
it to know how easy it can be

366
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,541
to take complete
control of a DWMA student.

367
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,416
Even if she's from the
NOT class. I cannot allow

368
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,291
her to be apprehended
and interrogated, however.

369
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,833
In which case,
let's put an end to this

370
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,708
little experiment by seeing
just how far the brainwashing

371
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,291
I've employed will
allow me to push her.

372
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,625
Kill yourself, girl.

373
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,000
No, don--

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
[MAKA]
Hurry and get help!

375
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,541
Somebody, help me
stop the bleeding!

376
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,291
Get something to
hold against this wound!

377
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,541
[ANYA] What should we
do? She's going to die!

378
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,166
[MEME] You need
to accept it, Tsugumi.

379
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,458
Sooner or later, you'll
have to choose a partner.

380
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,458
You'll have to
decide between me and Anya.

381
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,291
[ANYA] That's why you
don't have a blade yet, Tsugumi.

382
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,875
Because you have no resolve!

383
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,625
[TSUGUMI] That guy
has a screw in his head!

384
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,333
[MEME] Ultimately, no one else
can make this decision for you.
