[KIM]
Well?

00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,583
[JACQUELINE]
She hasn't even made a sound.

4
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,791
[JACQUELINE] I get that
she's not supposed to leave,

5
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,125
but is it really
necessary to guard the door?

6
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,041
We should do what we're told.

Sid is dead, Meme's missing,

and Anya's being sent home.

Things are crazy around here.

We may not know
exactly what's going on,

but it seems nuts to me that
Meme's one of their suspects.

12
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,500
So, where is Anya?

13
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,583
Apparently her
escort's already here.

00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,958
She'll be going straight
to the airport and then home.

Only me, Princess.

Oh, thank you, Alfred.

Traffic jam.

00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,791
It's because of
the Battle Festival.

Great time for a party.

[AKANE] What, did you
expect them to cancel it?

[MEME] Kill them all.
Kill them all.

They must die.
Kill them all.

Kill them all.
Kill them all.

Are those DWMA students, too?

Keep your guard up.

[HARVAR] There's
something off about them.

00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,875
They poisoned him?

What's happening?

00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,791
It looks like

I can take care of this.
You get yourselves to safety.

You don't need to do that!
Hurry and get in the car!

[BLACK STAR] It's nothin' to
worry about I could take them

54

all down by myself
if I really wanted to.

Let's not get too cocky, okay?

Just tellin' the truth.

I want a status report!

The NOT students.
They're running amok on campus.

We can't make contact with

Get Stein on the phone for me!

We need all hands on deck.

00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,375
[STEIN] The Battle Festival
is a real riot this year, huh?

68
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,416
[NAIGUS] Keep your
jokes to yourself, Dr. Stein.

69
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
How's the antidote coming?

70
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,541
[STEIN] I've got some
excellent samples to work with.

71
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,125
It shouldn't be
too much longer now.

[NAIGUS] However fast
you're working, work faster!

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,916
You'd think she's
in a hurry or something.

74
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,750
They're locking down the dorm?

75
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,250
What's going on out there?

76
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,750
Unfortunately,
I don't have any details yet,

77
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,125
but from what
I've learned so far,

78
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,833
the Battle Festival grounds
seem to be under attack.

79
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,791
And they think there may
be danger of an attack here,

80
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,083
as well?

81
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,000
It sounds crazy, but
the attackers appear to be

82
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,083
students from the NOT class.

83
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,583
[MISERY] At any rate, to
reduce the risk of additional

85
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,666
of the dormitory until
the situation is resolved.

86
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,958

00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,583
I really need
to get out of here.

90

[BOTH] Huh?

91
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,791
Meme could be out
there with the rest of them!

92
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,041
[JACQUELINE] Impossible!

93
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,708
The dorm's locked down.
No one's allowed out.

94
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,958
And you were already
not allowed to go anywhere.

95
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,291
One way or another, I'm going.

96
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,291
I don't care what you say.
Meme needs me!

97
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,750
What do you expect to
accomplish by yourself?

98
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,958
I won't be alone, though.
Anya will be coming with me.

99
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,791
No, she won't be. She's well on
her way to the airport by now.

100
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,416
I made them both a promise,
and I intend to keep it!

101
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,916
You don't understand!

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,833
I swore I would choose either
Anya or Meme as my partner

103
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,625
by the end of the day
today, and I still haven't

104
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,083
found a chance to tell
either of them how I feel.

105
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,750
Have you decided
between the two of them, then?

106
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,000
No, not yet.

107
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,625
Take a few deep breaths, okay?

108
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,916
You see. I've got this
feeling I just can't shake.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,666
I honestly don't think
Anya is going to leave us

110
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,708
and go home like
they told her to.

111
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,125
Clay got upset after
Sid died and snapped at Anya.

112
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,833
I'm guessing she
was probably pretty mad.

113
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,291
I know I would've been.

114
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,750
[TSUGUMI] Mad about how
everyone was deciding things

115
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,291
without asking her, and mad at
herself for not realizing it

116
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,916
sooner.
It all happened so fast.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,666
It must have
been really frustrating.

118
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,000
[TSUGUMI]
I was hurt.

119
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,958
I called out to her and she
didn't even look back at me.

120
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,500
But now I think she
didn't want me to see.

121
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,000
She was crying
out of frustration.

122
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,833
That's why I'm
so sure about this.

123
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,625
I don't think she would
feel right if she went home

124
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,458
without seeing things through.

125
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,083
[JACQUELINE]
Is it soul resonance?

126
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,083
Go on.

127
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,250
Listen.
This situation is serious.

128
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,708
[TSUGUMI]
I know it is. But please.

129
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,583
Well, your injury
doesn't look all that bad to me.

130
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,916
Right! It's all
about mind over matter.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,041
I'll be fine.

132
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,625
Don't get too sure of yourself.
You're still a NOT student.

133
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,166
Think it'll work?

134
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,958
Well, I know what
she's going through.

135
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,166
Wanting to protect
someone who's important to her,

136
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,708
even if it means
breaking the rules.

137
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,250
[TSUGUMI]
Housemistress!

138
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,166
Where are you going?

139

I'm very sorry, but this is
something I have to do.

It's okay.
You have my blessing.

Huh?

00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,666
Such determination!

143
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,166
It's exactly like a
scene out of The Commoner!

You're the Mary I've
always been looking for!

Sure.

146
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,791
You want this?

147
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,000
No, thanks. I'm good.

148
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,791
[ANYA]
Please stop the car.

149
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,166
Huh?

150
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,375
[ANYA] I need to stay
by Tsugumi's side right now.

That's where I belong.

00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,375
We've already told you--

Oh, just be quiet!

[ANYA]
Don't you understand?

155
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,666
I feel as sad about
Sid's death as you do, Clay.

156
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,458
It was my friend who...

157

[ANYA] Right now, the people
I care about are suffering.

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,250
How can I possibly go home?

159
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,333
Yes, but--

160
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,833
And what were
you thinking earlier?

161
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,458
Why didn't we stop and
help Ox? He was in trouble!

162
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,333
You don't understand--

163
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,833
I am a student of the DWMA.

164
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,958
I'll thank you to stop treating
me like a helpless little child!

165
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,541
Stop this car right now.

166
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,583
I'm sorry, Alfred.
But that's an order.

167
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,208
Wait, Princess! Please, don't--

168
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:35,958
Hey!

169
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,125
Stop right now!

170
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,208
[PATTY]
We did so much decorating.

171
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,083
Why did everybody stop coming?

172
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,416
The Battle Festival
is in full swing, huh?

173
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,125
Oh, good!
You guys are still here!

174
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,875
Uh. Hey, Tsugumi.

175
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,208
Is something wrong?

176
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,125
[TSUGUMI] Please. I need
to ask you for something.

177
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,125
For candy?

178
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,041
[TSUGUMI]
Not like that.

179
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,833
Anya is being shipped
back to her home country.

180
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,541
She's headed to the airport.

181
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,333
I'm trying to find
a way to go get her,

182
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,500
but things
are so crazy here.

183
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,541
The buses aren't running.

184
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,708
I can't catch a cab.

185
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,958
Stop babbling!
Get to the point, already!

186
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:25,750
Hey, Master!

187
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,333
Trick or Treat! Happy Halloween!

188
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,583
Huh?

189
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,166
We need to borrow your scooter.

190
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,500
Is it naïve to
ask you to be careful?

191
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,541
We'll be fine, don't worry!

192
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,208
[LIZ]
Hey, pedestrians! Look out!

193
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,791
Get outta my way
or I'll flatten you!

194
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,583
[TSUGUMI] Slow down!
We're gonna die!

195
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,916
[CLAY] I don't see how
we'll get it running again.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,416
[ANYA'S BUTLER]
No.

197
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,208
[AKANE] I'll make a call.
See if I can get us another car.

198
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,083
Well, I'm going
back to the school.

199
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,583
Huh? Hey!

200
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,708
[AKANE] Please,
Princess. Come back.

201
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,916
The mission that we were
assigned was to get you safely

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,375
to the airport.
It's our duty to see it through.

203
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,416
[AKANE] We cannot simply allow
you to walk off on your own.

204
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,541
Surely you understand that?

205
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,916
[ANYA]
No, I don't!

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,708
It sounds to me like
your real mission is to abandon

207
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:19,416
your friends. To sacrifice your
principles and act like cowards.

208
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,708
If I were you, I'd forget
about this stupid assignment!

209
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,375
I see we have little choice.

210
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,375
Akane.

211
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,500
Let me handle this, Clay.
The princess here is unarmed.

212
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,916
We can't very well
turn your blade against her.

213
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,708
This is an actual fight.
And I don't need any concessions

214
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,333
from you.

215
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,583
[AKANE] If this
was an actual fight,

216
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,708
you wouldn't have
had time to say all that.

217
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,916
Your pride'll get
the best of you yet.

218
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,208
I don't care what
it requires of me.

219
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,333
I am going to return to Tsugumi.

220
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,541
I can't let you go.

221
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,625
Over there!
Is that a witch?

222
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,333
Where?

223
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,250
That was a sneaky trick!

224
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,791
Let me go I'll scream
bloody murder if you don't.

225
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,333
Let's say you do go
back. Your friend's scared.

226
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,333
It's possible
she's given up already.

227
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,416
There's no way she'd do that.

228
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
Tsugumi knows I
would come back to her.

229
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,000
She's waiting for me right now.

230
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,708
[TSUGUMI]
Anya!

231
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,125
[TSUGUMI]
I found you! We need to go!

232
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,666
Why are you
just standing around?

233
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,416
We've got a crisis
on our hands, here!

234
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,916
This isn't a good time
for you to be making out.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,291
Us making out?

236
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:53,500
I'm very sorry. I don't
know if you can forgive me.

237
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,458
Don't worry about it, okay?

238
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,833
Finding Meme is the only
thing that matters right now.

239
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,000
Then let's go.

240
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,416
[CLAY] What'll you
do when you find her?

241
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,666
Can you release her
from Shaula's mind control?

242
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,458
Because if not, you'll
just end up having to fight her.

243
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,833
Besides, for all you know,
the witch could be right there

244
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,875
with Tatane.

245
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,250
Shaula's using Soul Protect
to keep hidden from the academy.

246
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,833
That means she's
unable to use her own magic

247
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,916
which makes Tatane
a useful pawn to her.

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,458
She'll likely want to maximize
the strength of her powers,

249
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,375
so she'll probably
be overseeing the chaos

250
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,208
from a nearby location.

251
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,583
It doesn't matter.

252
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,833
Whatever might be waiting
for us when we get there,

253
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,000
we'll deal with it.

254
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,041
First, we need to
focus on finding Meme.

255
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,375
I agree.
Come on, let's get going!

256
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,875
[TSUGUMI] Except...

257
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,083
Sorry, ladies.
She can't seat three people.

258
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,708
All right, then. You try turning
yourself into a flying halberd.

259
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,750
But how? I don't know.

260
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,000
Remember the
demonstration Jacqueline did?

261
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,541
Picture it in your head.

262
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,708
[ANYA] I believe in you.
I know you can do this.

263
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,791
[ANYA] You can fly,
Tsugumi. Find your wings.

264
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,625
I knew you could!

265
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,583
[TSUGUMI] Whoa,
it's hard to balance.

266
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,625
Hold on. Are they?

267
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,750
Yes, they are.
That's soul resonance.

268
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,125
[BOTH]
Huh?

269
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,416
[AKANE] When a meister
and weapon are in harmony

270
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,625
they can feel
each other's emotions,

271
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,333
and are able to
share their imaginations.

272
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,583
So this is soul resonance.

273
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,958
Dr. Stein's got a
blood sample from Tatane.

274
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,500
He's using it to make an
antidote to Shaula's toxin.

275
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,291
What are you doing?

276
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,375
Knowing Doctor Stein, he'll
work swiftly and efficiently.

277
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,000
He should be nearly
done with it by now.

278
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:17,916
Hey!

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,500
[TSUGUMI]
Well, Anya hop on!

280
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,708
Yes, ma'am!

281
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,208
And one more thing.
Please, you two, be careful.

282
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,916
Right!

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,375
[TSUGUMI]
Here goes nothing!

284
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,583
[TSUGUMI] Um, Anya,
could you hop off and give

285
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,791
us a running start?

286
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,458
Okay!

287
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,333
[TSUGUMI]
Higher!

288
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,291
Don't hit the tree!

289
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,125
[LIZ]
Good luck you guys!

290
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,416
You've got a soft spot
for Harudori, don't you?

291
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,666
Me?

292
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,750
Well, you have to admit,
she is pretty adorable.

293
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,500
That doesn't make it right.

294
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,041
Yeah, all right.
Come on, we should get back.

295
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,291
Yeah.

296
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,958
[ANYA] Wah!
Tsugumi, go slower!

297
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,666
The brakes!
Hit the brakes!

298
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,916
[TSUGUMI]
What brakes?

299
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,250
[screaming]

300
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,708
[STEIN]
So you came here.

301
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,958
Yes, that's right.

302
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,625
Now please give us
the antidote and we'll go.

303
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,333
[STEIN] Straight to
the point. I like that.

304
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,041
Hmm.
So what should I do?

305
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,833
Well, how about you
start by being more decisive.

306
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,083
We can't afford
to waste any time.

307
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,458
[STEIN] There are two very
good reasons why I shouldn't

308
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,583
give this to you.
Want to hear?

309
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,958
[BOTH]
Hurry up!

310
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,083
[STEIN] Number one: This
antidote is only designed to

311
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,083
break down the toxin in
the blood. Its effect on any

312
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,375
magical mind control is
as yet unclear. Of course,

313
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,083
there's a chance
it won't work at all.

314
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,500
And in the worst-case
scenario, she could die.

315
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,333
Die?

316
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,125
Okay, okay, I'm
joking about that.

317
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,708
Your sense of humor
leaves a lot to be desired.

318
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,083
If you don't stop with
those stupid jokes...

319
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,583
What's the second reason?

320
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,333
This sample has actually
already been spoken for.

321
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,541
In fact, Naigus is
headed over from the DWMA

322
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,333
to pick it up right now.

323
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,125
She'll come here,
take this sample, and return

324
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,250
to the school. Then, after
verifying its effectiveness,

325
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,125
she'll mass produce it.
That should all take three

326
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:51,958
days or so.

327
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,291
No, that's too long!

328
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,666
What if something happens
to Meme in the meantime?

329
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,708
Dr. Stein, the sample!

330
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,625
What in the world
are you doing here?

331
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,875
What do you think?

332
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,250
We came for the antidote
so we could save Meme

333
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,833
from the witch!

334
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,416
As I recall, you're supposed to
be on your way to the airport.

335
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,208
Make this easier on all of
us and do what you're told!

336
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,875
We just want to
give the drug to Meme.

337
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,375
That should test its
effectiveness. Let us go!

338
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,625
Don't be ridiculous.

339
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,666
You two are little
more than children!

340
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,500
You need to leave this to us.

341
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,541
We're all fighting
the same enemy, here.

342
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,708
The enemy might be the same,

343
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,208
but I think our
priorities are different.

344
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,958
It should start neutralizing
the toxin immediately.

345
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, get going!

346
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,125
[TSUGUMI]
Sorry about this!

347
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,333
We'll let you know as
soon as we have Meme!

348
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,541
Get back here! What
were you thinking, Stein?

349
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,583
You gave them the--

350
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,583
No one else understands
my jokes, but I enjoy them.

351
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,208
We have to find her
as quickly as we can.

352
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,666
[TSUGUMI] Searching randomly
like this won't do any good.

353
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,500
Probably not, but do
you have any other ideas?

354
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,500
[TSUGUMI]
I was thinking.

355
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,833
Yes? What is it?

356
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,416
Remember what Clay told
us earlier, about how it's

357
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,166
very likely that Shaula will
want to keep Meme by her side?

358
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,375
[ANYA] Yes.

359
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,333
What if we look for
Shaula instead of Meme?

360
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,833
Okay, do you know of some
special way to locate a witch?

361
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,875
We can use a messenger bat!

362
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,083
[ANYA]
Huh?

363
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,625
Well, that landing was
better than the first one.

364
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,041
How was that any better?

365
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, well, you know, heh.

366
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,208
We need to follow
that bat! Come on!

367
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,291
Hurry up!

368
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,125
[ANYA]
Geez!

369
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,541
[SHAULA] Yes,
kill each other.

370
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,625
[SHAULA] Paint the
town crimson with the blood

371
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,875
of your erstwhile friends.

372
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,666
Embrace chaos! Say
goodbye to order and harmony!

373
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,250
[MEME]
Kill them all.

374
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,333
[SHAULA] No one will
be allowed to sleep.

375
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,958
[SHAULA] Your precious
Battle Festival is over,

376
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,875
but the real fun
is only just beginning.

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,041
[ANYA]
Are you there, Meme?

378
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,166
We came for you!

379
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,791
We're here, Meme!
We're here!

380
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,333
Kill them all.
Kill them all. They must die.

381
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,083
Kill them all.
Kill them all.

382
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,041
[TSUGUMI] The witch is
using her mind control power

383
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,541
to force Meme to attack us!

384
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,625
[ANYA] Tsugumi,
stay back!

385
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,250
I'll find some
way to stop her!

386
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,416
[MEME] Please! I don't
want to hurt anybody else!

387
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,583
[TSUGUMI] All right,
everyone, here goes!

388
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,875
[ALL] We're
going to stop the witch and

389
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:30,875
take our lives back!
