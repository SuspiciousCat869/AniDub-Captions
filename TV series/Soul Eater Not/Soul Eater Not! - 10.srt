1
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,125
[TSUGUMI] All right!
Jack o' lanterns complete!

2
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,916
[MEME] Wow, they really
look just like us, don't they?

3
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,416
[ANYA] I don't look
anything like a pumpkin!

4
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,708
Absolutely perfect!

5
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,125
[MEME]
I'm back from the store!

6
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,541
[TSUGUMI]
Well, what did you get?

7
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,000
It's something very exciting!
My Halloween costume!

8
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,250
What are you going to be?

9
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,458
It's a secret! Oh, wow!

10
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,750
Look at these cute little guys!
They look fantastic!

11
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,458
[MEME] Man. I wish
mine was as good as those!

12
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,166
Actually, I think the one you
carved is pretty adorable, too!

13
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,041
Don't you think so, Anya?

14
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,916
That's really creepy.

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,083
Not exactly a light-
hearted jack o' lantern.

16
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,583
Definitely not cute.

17
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,333
You told me I was
supposed to take a pumpkin

18
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,291
and make a
spooky head out of it.

19
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,375
There's absolutely
nothing spooky about that!

20
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,500
Here, would you like a bow?

21
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,708
Hmph!

22
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,708
Didn't think so.

23
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,416
Fine!

24
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,208
Wow, really?

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,208
[knocking]

26
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,500
Coming!

27
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,958
I think a red one
would look better, though.

28
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,875
Huh?

29
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,291
A letter. It's for you.

30
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,958
Oh! Thanks for
bringing it to me.

31
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,541
Looks like it's from my mom.

32
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,291
You're still pretty
young, aren't you, Kana?

33
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,875
Are you going to go around
trick or treating for candy?

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,166
Back away! It's a monster!

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,250
Hey!

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,750
Banish evil spirits!

37
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,541
That's it! You're
getting no candy from me!

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,583
Seriously?

39
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,708
Halloween is supposed
to be a scary holiday!

40
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,833
That's what you
said, right, Tsugumi?

41
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,125
Tsugumi?

42
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,083
No!

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,416
[TSUGUMI]
It can't be! It can't!

44
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,083
[TSUGUMI]
I have to get home!

45
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,625
Go home? Why?

46
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,166
Tsugumi, what's going on?

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,291
Come on!

48
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,541
Please, just tell
us what's the matter!

49
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,000
Did something happen?

50
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,458
[TSUGUMI]
Why won't it open?

51
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,625
Pochi!

52
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:20,375
[crying]

53
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,291
Hi, Tsugumi.
I made you a little snack.

54
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,208
Maybe you'd like to
try eating something?

55
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,666
[TSUGUMI]
Not hungry right now.

56
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,125
It might settle you
a bit to have something

57
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,791
in your stomach, though.

58
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,083
They'll be right here
if you change your mind.

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,916
I'm back from the store!

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,375
I picked out my Halloween
costume. It's a secret, though!

61
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,458
Uh.

62
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,791
Oh, wow! Look at
these cute little guys!

63
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,000
They really are fantastic! Man!

64
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,541
I wish mine looked that good!

65
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,583
Meme, stop!

66
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,458
What's wrong?

67
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,583
Hey, Tsugumi.
What's the matter with you?

68
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,916
Is she sick or something?

69
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,458
[TSUGUMI]
How can you just forget?

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,708
How can you just
forget everything so easily

71
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:28,416
all the time? It's awful!
Good or bad, it doesn't matter.

72
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,208
You forget everything!

73
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,750
And you're especially
quick to forget when it

74
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,708
has something to do
with me! Meme, you idiot!

75
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,833
[MEME]
I'm so sorry.

76
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,250
Whatever I've forgotten, I can
tell that it's really important

77
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:49,625
to you.
I'm really sorry, Tsugumi.

78
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,041
[MEME]
I'll leave now.

79
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,375
Meme, wait.

80
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,041
I can make stew
by myself now, too.

81
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,208
I know it's simple,
but I'm learning.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,000
It's good, thanks.

83
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,750
[ANYA] Oh!
There you are.

84
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,208
Hurry up and eat your
stew, or it'll get cold.

85
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,583
Sorry to interrupt.
I'll eat back in the room.

86
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,250
[ANYA] Where's she going?

87
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,125
I wonder what's
gotten into her tonight.

88
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,041
She's more restless than normal.

89
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,291
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,875
Fine.

91
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,916
[TSUGUMI] Wouldn't our
best bet be waking her up

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,541
and taking her back home?

93
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,416
[ANYA] No. I want to
know what she's up to.

94
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,666
I'll watch her and then
tell her about it later.

95
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,166
[ANYA] You can go back to
the room and get some sleep

96
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,416
if you want.

97
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,000
[TSUGUMI] I doubt I'd be able
to get much more sleep, anyway.

98
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,916
I wish we knew how
much farther she's going.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,333
I'm getting pretty tired.

100
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,458
We've been in that room
before. Maybe she's having

101
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,000
a dream about the
other time we came down here.

102
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,375
Strange. Why would
she have key to that door?

103
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,875
I don't think she's supposed to
go in there without permission.

104
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,500
Get down!
What are you doing, Meme?

105
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,625
[ANYA] Please wake up!
This room is private.

106
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,291
We shouldn't be in here!

107
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,041
Please! Let's go!
Wake up, Meme!

108
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,208
[AKANE] What's going on?
It's really late.

109
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,541
Akane and Clay.
You frightened us.

110
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,833
What are you two doing
here in the middle of the night?

111
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,041
Sid asked us to come
in. Apparently, there was

112
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,041
some overtime work
he wanted our help with.

113
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,166
[ANYA] At this hour?

114
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,416
[ANYA]
Oh! Meme! Are you okay?

115
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,666
[MEME] Anya?

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,208
Where are we?
What's going on?

117
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,958
And how did I get here?

118
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,916
You okay? That looked bad.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,083
Yes.

120
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,625
The research room
is a real mess, huh?

121
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,708
I'm confused.
Did I do all this?

122
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,125
I'm sorry, but,
I have to report this to Sid.

123
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,375
Would you please come with me?

124
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,958
Meme was just walking
in her sleep, though--

125
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,208
I'll go with you.

126
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,791
In that case, Clay, will
you see the other two home?

127
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,708
Yeah.

128
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,291
[AKANE] Tatane. Let's go.

129
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,875
[ANYA]
Thank you for escorting us.

130
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,666
Yeah, sure.

131
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,916
[CLAY]
Hey, wait.

132
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,625
I hate to ask this,
but... Do you think you

133
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,416
could bring Tatane
a change of clothes later?

134
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,333
Huh? What does
she need clothes for?

135
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,750
[CLAY] Well. She may not be
able to come home right away.

136
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
Why? I know she shouldn't
have gone in that room

137
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,208
without asking,
but she's no criminal.

138
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,458
I can't explain it
all right now, I'm sorry.

139
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,166
You'll have to get
more answers from Sid.

140
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,583
[SID] Get in
touch with Dr. Stein.

141
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,125
Request that he
examine Tatane immediately.

142
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,208
[MAN IN SUIT] Right.

143
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,541
Have you found
out how she got the key

144
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,708
to the research room, yet?

145
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,041
[SHORT HAIRED MAN IN SUIT]
No, but I will.

146
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,083
This is the connection
we've been waiting for.

147
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,625
It will lead 
to Shaula eventually.

148
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,708
I am a persistent man,
after all.

149
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,166
[RED HAIRED MAN]
Sorry. Sid?

150
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,541
I have Meme
Tatane's roommates.

151
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,166
They're asking if
they can talk to you.

152
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,625
They sound like
they're determined.

153
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,250
I'll see them.

154
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,333
There's no way!

155
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,708
You're trying to tell us that
Meme is allied with a witch?

156
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,375
Try to remain calm.
It's indisputable that

157
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,541
Tatane was caught
stealing privileged information.

158
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,625
We should have proof of her
link to the witch before long.

159
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,708
[ANYA]
That's impossible!

160
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,916
[TSUGUMI]
It doesn't make sense.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,083
This is all still just
supposition, but we think there

162
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,750
is a good chance that her mind
is being controlled by a witch.

163
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,333
But how?
I don't understand any of this!

164
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,708
We know the witch.
We believe she's also

165
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,750
responsible
for the Traitor attacks,

166
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,416
and what happened with
Eternal Feather at the bazaar.

167
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,083
[SID] Shaula Gorgon.

168
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,291
[SID] We think she
uses a combination of

169
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,000
toxins and suggestion.

170
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,666
Well, then, doesn't that
mean Meme is one of her victims?

171
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,125
There are differences.
Things that are unique

172
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,958
to Tatane's case.

173
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,333
[SID] For example, she doesn't
appear to be experiencing

174
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,708
insomnia or lack
of emotional response.

175
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,666
[SID] Considering her
behavior last night as well as

176
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,041
the memory issues
she seems to exhibit,

177
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,625
I believe she is
under the influence of an

178
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,416
even more powerful mind control.

179
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,958
[SID] That said, she needs
to be examined extensively.

180
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,333
No way. That's the
reason she's so forgetful?

181
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,583
Because she's
under a witch's power?

182
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,750
I can't be sure,
but it's likely.

183
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,541
Meme.

184
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,833
Can we see her?
Where is she now?

185
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,500
It's best that you not know.

186
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,666
This is too dangerous
for NOT students like you.

187
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,333
That's all the
more reason, then!

188
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,916
Meme's a NOT student,
too, remember!

189
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,000
She is in the
custody of the DWMA.

190
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,041
We're all finished here, ladies.

191
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,750
When I learn more,
I'll be in touch.

192
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,166
Sid, come back!

193
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,666
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,625
[ANYA]
Don't be ridiculous.

195
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,708
That is not Meme.
It barely even looks like her.

196
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,375
Yeah, but...

197
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,500
Just think
about it for a second.

198
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,166
You were hypnotized
by a witch and forced

199
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,291
by her to do who knows what.

200
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
Then you got caught
and locked away somewhere.

201
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,416
What do you want
your partner to be doing?

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,791
Apologizing to a pumpkin?

203
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,666
[ANYA] Personally,
I would expect better from

204
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,083
my partner than that.

205
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,750
Well, what should we do?

206
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,875
I wish I knew the answer,
but I have no idea, either.

207
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,666
It's hard, huh?

208
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,250
I'm really sorry,
by the way.

209
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,916
About what
happened to Pochi, I mean.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,958
Yeah.

211
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,625
[ANYA] I'm going to
get a little exercise.

212
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,250

213
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,458
[TSUGUMI]
Is that a bat?

214
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,583
[ANYA] Get rid of it,
Tsugumi! Do something!

215
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,833
[TSUGUMI] What
do you want me to do?

216
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,333
[ANYA] There!
Now you can get it! Hurry!

217
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,083
What? I can't reach it!

218
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,166
Wait, Anya. Look at that.

219
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,125
[TSUGUMI]
It's a messenger bat.

220
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,291
[TSUGUMI] Look!
It's for us! A note from Meme!

221
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,666
[AKANE] How is
Tatane doing so far?

222
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,875
[SID] For the
moment, she's still calm.

223
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,541
I don't feel
good about doing this.

224
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,625
It's not right, using a student
as bait to lure Shaula to us.

225
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,208
You saw the examination
results from Stein, didn't you?

226
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,333
There's a mystery contaminant
in the girl's bloodstream.

227
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,208
Until this case is solved,
she's in real danger.

228
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,916
Keep your focus on the mission.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,750
That's how you
can best help her.

230
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,000
Right.

231
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,041
But should we be
forced to make a choice.

232
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,833
Tatane's safety wins
over capturing Shaula?

233
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,083
Of course it does.

234
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,625
[MAN IN SUIT]
Someone's coming in the back.

235
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,833

They're both girls,

Yes.

Earlier,
what I said. I'm sorry.

Really, I didn't know
what had happened to you.

Why must I go?

317
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,875
[CLAY] We have an agreement
with your country, Princess.

318
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,625
That if any
danger were to befall you,

319
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,083
we'd return you
to your land at once.

320
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,250
Sid said that if
anything happened to him,

321
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,750
it was on us
to use our discretion

322
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,750
as to when to send you home.

323
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,291
Why did he
choose the two of you?

324
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,458
[AKANE]
Pardon, Princess.

325
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,333
But we're actually
EAT students as well

326
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,541
as employees of
Central Intelligence.

327
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,000
Our mission was you.

328
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,458
We were placed in the NOT
class to be your bodyguards.

329
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,416
Oh, I see.

330
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,208
Please, tell me what's going on.

331
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,291
Let's go.

332
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,791
I can't go now! You
can't expect me to leave

333
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,041
at a time like this
and abandon my partner!

334
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,125
What are you talking about?

335
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,166
You aren't even
formally partners yet.

336
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,666
Well, no, but still--

337
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,416
Sid is dead! Don't you get
that? We can't afford to spend

338
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,083
our time babysitting
three little girls anymore!

339
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,750
We'll walk you back
to the dorms for now.

340
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
It's dangerous out.
So until your escort arrives,

341
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,916
please remain inside.

342
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,500
Wait, Anya!

343
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,125
Please.
Tell me what's happening!

344
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,083
[TSUGUMI]
Everything is falling to pieces.

345
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,625
We each have our
own battles to fight,

346
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,791
but we're not giving up!

347
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:23,875
[ANYA] No matter what,
I will come back

348
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,750
to you, Tsugumi!
I promise!

349
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,625
[MEME] Tsugumi,
Anya, please help me!

350
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,041
[TSUGUMI] Hold on, Meme!
We're coming!

351
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,250
[ANYA] Hold on, Meme!
We're coming!
