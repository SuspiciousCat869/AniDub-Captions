1
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,208
[LIZ]
You're adorable, Patty.

2
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,083
Thanks, Sis, that's sweet!

3
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,041
[panting]

4
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,333
[PATTY]
Sis, what?

5
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,916
[LIZ]
There's still plenty more.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,875
Yum!

7
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,708
[LIZ]
Patty.

8
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,250
This is lame.
How about we ditch class

9
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,125
and go find somewhere to smoke?

10
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,541
I've got a C-note, so I say we
grab some honeys and tear it up.

11
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,958
You down with that?

12
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,500
Uh, You guys. Maybe we
should tone it down considering

13
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,958
we're in Master's shop.

14
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,500
Yeah?
You want some of this, do ya?

15
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,791
[MEME] I'll bust a
cap in you! Bring it!

16
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,708
Man, I wish I'd never
introduced them to that show.

17
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,375
The hell are you from, girlie?

18
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,250
I'm the hell from
CSI, that's where!

19
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,583
[INVESTIGATOR]
Hey, you! Get over here and

20
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,375
analyze the soil trace
on the bottom of this shoe!

21
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,041
[YO-YO GIRL] How did I end
up stuck here collectin' prints?

22
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,041
You punks!
You better stop screwin' around!

23
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,625
The hell are you
from, anyway, girlie?

24
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,000
Wha, me? The DWMA.

25
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,208
Yeah? And where's that?

26
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,916
I never heard of
that place before.

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,041
You know Meme,
given your memory problems,

28
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,375
that doesn't necessarily
come across as a joke.

29
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,666
It's not.
What is the DWMA?

30
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,583
[TSUGUMI] The
academy the three of us go to.

31
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,791
[LIZ] Hey!

32
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,416
You gonna order
something already?

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,416
Oh, yes, of course.

34
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,208
I'll just have a
Napolitan, please.

35
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,958
Today's lunch special, please.

36
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,375
Um, er....

37
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,166
Huh?

38
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,000
I, um. Uh-uh-uh-uh-um.

39
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

40
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,083
The order's ready.
Here you go.

41
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,208
Go on, Patty.

42
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,458
[ANYA]
I wonder who they are.

43
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,625
I don't think they're
faking the "tough guy" routine.

44
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,916
Those gals are the real deal!

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,333
[ANYA] We better keep our
peepers on 'em just to be safe.

46
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,791
Oh, good.
We're still doing that.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,291
[ANYA] You shouldn't
slam plates down like that.

48
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,500
Also, I ordered a Napolitan,
not whatever this sandwich is.

49
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,208
Huh?
You want a Napolitan?

50
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,791
[PATTY]
Never heard of it.

51
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,125
Okay. Well,
everything Master prepares

52
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,458
is delicious, so I
suppose this will suffice.

53
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,125
Just shut up and eat what's
in front of you, princess.

54
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,791
You'll regret it if you don't.

55
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,750
All right, our shift's
over. We're takin' off now.

56
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,500
Okay. Well, good work today.

57
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,000
Who are they, Master?

58
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,875
[MASTER]
Oh, them?

59
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,041
[MASTER] My new hires.
The Thompson sisters,

60
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,333
Liz and Patty.
They're on probation,

61
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,000
so do me a favor
and go easy on 'em, okay?

62
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,541
What do you
mean, "on probation"?

63
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,125
Well, interestingly enough,
they're like our Tsugumi here.

64
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,791
They have the ability
to transform into weapons.

65
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,041
[MASTER] When they were just
children, they were abandoned

66
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,875
on the streets of
Brooklyn, New York. In order to

67
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
keep themselves from
starving, they had to

68
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,750
dirty their hands a little.

69
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,125
[MASTER] Of course, a
crime is a crime, whether or not

70
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,791
it's a matter of survival.

71
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,416
[MASTER] However,
they caught the eye

72
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,375
of a certain VIP from the DWMA.

73
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,083
The sisters were wearing
bracelets around their wrists.

74
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,125
Did you notice that?

75
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,291
[MASTER] They're
equipped with GPS trackers.

76
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,375
By activating them,
the DWMA can always

77
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,250
know where the sisters are.

78
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,166
Well, that's a
relief. Those young ladies

79
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,708
seem like they ought to be
kept under close supervision.

80
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,583
[MASTER]
Here you go. It's on the house.

81
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,250
[ALL] Ooh!

82
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,500
[MASTER]
Sorry about today.

83
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,416
[ANYA] Everything
you make is fantastic,

84
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,041
but even for you the
Napolitan is something special.

85
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,125
[MEME]
Can we have some?

86
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,541
You're not going
to eat it all, right?

87
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,583
[ANYA]
Of course I'm not!

88
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,041
[TSUGUMI] You said
they were abandoned

89
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,375
when they were children.
Why would somebody do that?

90
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,875
[MASTER] It's not
something I've asked them about.

91
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,125
I just thought maybe their
weapon abilities were to blame.

92
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,333
They're alive
because of those abilities.

93
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,208
That's how they were able to
make it this far on their own.

94
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,708
If they didn't have
their weapon powers,

95
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,000
well, they're pretty
girls, and you know...

96
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,875
There's no telling
what could have happened.

97
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,875
Hmm. Weapon
abilities, pros and cons.

98
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,666
[ANYA]
Hey, Tsugumi!

99
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,416
We're going to finish
this off without you!

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,666
Huh?
Wait, don't! I'm coming!

101
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,750
[ANYA]
Watch it, Meme.

102
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,250
You're taking
more than your share.

103
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,291
You're right, I am.

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,750
[ANYA] Why! That's
absolutely shameless!

105
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,166
[MEME]
Okay, fine. Say "ah."

106
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,208
[ANYA] "Ah." Wha- whoa!
Hold on! What are you doing?

107
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,208
[ANYA]
That was delicious!

108
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,291
[MASTER] Good.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

109
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,416
[ANYA]
You know, Meme...

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,333
You look like you've put
on a little weight lately.

111
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,791
Maybe.

112
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,916
I don't even remember the
last time I weighed myself.

113
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,750
Oh. It's those
annoying customers

114
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,250
from earlier, Patty. You
know what I just realized?

115
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,625
We never did get
our tip from you.

116
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,125
Customers aren't
actually expected

117
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,250
to leave tips at
Deathbucks Café.

118
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,625
You don't even know that?

119
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,541
You must not be
very good at your job.

120
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,625
[PATTY]
Yeah?

121
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,750
Someone who's
dressed like a princess

122
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,666
really shouldn't
talk so tough.

123
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,083
It isn't very
good for your health.

124
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,041
[LIZ] Let's take
this somewhere else.

125
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,583
[LIZ] You guys are
DWMA students, right?

126
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,000
Why not show us your
fancy academy skills, huh?

127
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,125
No, no, no.

128
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,416
We're actually in
the NOT class rather

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,041
than the EAT
class, you see.

130
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,541
So fighting isn't our thing.

131
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,708
So you're not only annoying--

132
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,666
you're worthless, too.

133
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,291
[ANYA] Whatever class we may
be in, we won't just stand here

134
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,208
and let you talk
to us in this manner.

135
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,458
[TSUGUMI]
But Anya.

136
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,083
We're as good as
you are. We're DWMA students!

137
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,375
Sounds to me like they
wanna go at it, huh, Patty?

138
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,916
Yeah.
This oughtta be good.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,500
You're up, Tsugumi.
Transform yourself.

140
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,666
[ANYA]
Do it now!

141
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,500
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

142
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,708
Wait, Anya. You're
really going to fight them?

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,416
Aw, how sad.

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,708
[LIZ] Your blade
hasn't even come in yet.

145
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,166
Well, you ready, Patty?

146
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,750
'Course I am.
Let's do it, Sis.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,458
[TSUGUMI]
I wonder what it'll be.

148
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,375
Since they're
street thugs, maybe

149
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,291
a bat or chain or something?

150
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,750
Or pocket knife
or brass knuckles.

151
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,208
She's a pistol!

152
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,625
Well, what's the matter now?

153
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,666
[LIZ]
What's wrong, princess?

154
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,291
Too scared to fight us?
Were you all talk, then?

155
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,833
[TSUGUMI] Well, considering
I'm a close-range weapon

156
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,958
without a blade,
and you've got a gun.

157
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,125
This isn't exactly a fair fight.

158
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,375
Who said it would be?

159
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,041
[LIZ] Some people are
born with everything,

160
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,375
and some people aren't.

161
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,458
Fair has nothing
to do with it.

162
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,583
This is a real
fight, not a fair one.

163
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,250
We aren't competing
in a ring for trophies.

164
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,166
This isn't a sport.

165
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,291
[LIZ] Anyone who agrees to
fight under equal conditions

166
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,208
is either a damned fool
or an arrogant jerk who's

167
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,083
underestimating her opponent.

168
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,000
You would be better
off at home polishing

169
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,250
your tiara and
playing with your dolls.

170
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,083
You shouldn't say that.

171
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,041
Not until after
you've defeated me.

172
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,916
Like I'm gonna be
intimidated by someone who

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,083
wouldn't last
three days on the street.

174
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,250
Okay, tell you
what. I won't shoot.

175
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,458
I'll just stand here.

176
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I'll show you!

177
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,291
[LIZ]
Patty!

178
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,000
[TSUGUMI] Yeah, that's
right! They're both weapons!

179
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,416
Remember what my sister said...

180
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,416
We never fight under equal
conditions if we can help it.

181
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,666
[gunshot]

182
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,458
What did they do?

183
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,791
Are you okay?

184
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,041
We would probably get
in some serious trouble

185
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,666
if we messed you up
while we were on probation.

186
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,791
So we'll let you
off with a warning for now.

187
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,416
[SID] It's commonly held
that the first humans that

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,583
could transform into
weapons were born as a

189
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,625
result of witches' research.

190
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,083
[SID] Using witch souls and
their ability to transform,

191
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,041
the witches
joined weapons and people,

192
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,000
thus creating the genes
for becoming a living weapon.

193
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,666
[SID]
Those genes became atavistic,

194
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,541
and that is how you came
to be here. Additionally...

195
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,250
[bell chimes]

196
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,041
That's it, right?
We're all finished for today.

197
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,208
I say we go get some lunch.

198
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,083
We could go to Master's
shop. He always has good food.

199
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,041
You are joking
about that, right?

200
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,083
Uh.

201
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,458
[MEME]
Don't look at us like that!

202
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,583
Even I won't ever
forget how those two sisters

203
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,083
nearly popped a cap in
us. It was too terrifying!

204
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,166
Oh, that's enough!

205
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,916
I thought I told
you it's past time that

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,958
you stopped
using that street slang.

207
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,458
[ANYA] You were supposed
to forget those inappropriate

208
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,208
terms, but instead
you forgot to forget.

209
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,875
[MEME]
This is getting complicated.

210
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,416
What exactly did
I forget this time?

211
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,041
Ah, welcome back.

212
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,541
Hi. Anya and Meme are
really busy today so...

213
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,000
it's just me.

214
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,458
[MOUSTACHE MAN]
What's the matter with you!

215
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,208
I've never gotten
worse service than this.

216
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,291
I don't really care.
If you've got a problem,

217
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,166
take it up with
the guy who hired me.

218
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,666
[MOUSTACHE MAN] You're lucky you
have a pretty face, you brat.

219
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,916
[LIZ] Oh, yeah? Well,
shut it, you dirty old man.

220
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,625
It's you.
What do ya want?

221
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,833
I'm sorry!
Please don't be mad, okay?

222
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,416
I didn't come here
to bother you, I swear!

223
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,125
I like this place, that's all.

224
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,375
So I came to get something
to eat, like I usually do.

225
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,250
Don't mind me.

226
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,875
So hurry up and order already.

227
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,041
Oh, right! Of course!

228
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm sorry! I've
already chosen something.

229
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,250
Um, what was it again?

230
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,625
[ANYA]
You're going there again today?

231
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,000
[TSUGUMI]
Yes.

232
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,708
But today is special
strawberry tart day, remember?

233
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,625
The three of us have
a date in the cafeteria.

234
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,375
Why are you set on this, anyway?

235
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,583
[TSUGUMI] Because
weapons should stick together.

236
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,083
[TSUGUMI] I had a
nice, normal childhood.

237
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,416
If I'd been
abandoned in Brooklyn,

238
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,833
I probably would have
been dead in under three days.

239
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
That's it!

240
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,875
I'm going to that café
and ordering whatever I want!

241
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,416
Hands down, that was
the worst service ever.

242
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, they did
everything but spit on us.

243
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,041
All right!

244
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,708
Looks like the coast is clear.

245
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,333
Seriously?
You again?

246
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,166
Y-Yes, it's me.

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,708
And there's something
I came here to order.

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,541
Excuse me.

00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah?

seem worked up about it.

Oh, I am!

ask what you wanted.

00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,041
[LIZ]
You're bothering the customers.

315
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,250
What customers?

316
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,250
Thanks to you, there
don't appear to be any.

317
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,208
You were supposed to
behave yourselves here.

318
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,375
What do you think
community service is for?

319
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,541
[LIZ] Just shut
up! Get outta here!

320
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,375
Excuse me.

321
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,916
Uh, what are you?

322
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,500
[TSUGUMI]
Shining, golden eyes.

323
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,333
[TSUGUMI] Um.

324
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,333
Hmm. Better.

325
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,833
[KID]
You're all symmetrical now.

326
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,083
I'll be on my way.

327
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,333
What does he
mean, "symmetrical"?

328
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,041
I'm so bored.

329
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,458
Ugh, what's the big deal?

330
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,875
We're doing everything
like we're supposed to.

331
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,125
We're even wearing these
frilly, degrading uniforms.

332
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,708
[LIZ]
We can't help how we are!

333
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,458
On the streets
you can't sit back

334
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,333
and take crap from anyone.

335
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,750
[LIZ] How are we
supposed to suddenly start being

336
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,000
all sweet to everybody!

337
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,000
It may not help, but I
know you're trying your best.

338
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,125
No one is expecting--

339
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,125
[LIZ] Oh, please.
Don't give me that!

340
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,583
Don't pretend like you
understand anything about us.

341
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,708
No one really does.

342
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,875
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

343
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,375
Why do you keep
coming back here?

344
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,208
I mean it. You already
got punched in the face once.

345
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,833
[LIZ] So why?
You messing with us?

346
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,083
I wouldn't do that.

347
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,250
What, then?

348
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,333
You want to prove
you're not scared of us?

349
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,291
[TSUGUMI]
No! That's not it, either.

350
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,541
I am scared! I'm terrified.

351
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,500
But even though I'm
afraid, there's more to it.

352
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,083
I can't help but
admire your strength, too.

353
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,458
I hoped that if
I kept coming here,

354
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,750
I would get to be
a little stronger,

355
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,625
like you two are, you know?

356
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,416
And also, if I'm
being totally honest...

357
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,916
I have to admit
I'm kinda jealous of

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,166
how cool you are.

359
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,708
[TSUGUMI] And
pretty, too, for that matter.

360
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,833
Eh, shut up.
What d'you know, anyway?

361
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,875
What's wrong with you, Sis?

362
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,916
[GREEN HOODIE MAN]
Is this the right shop?

363
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,083
[RED HOODIE MAN]
Yeah. This is the place.

364
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,791
Apparently the
waitresses are way hot,

365
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,208
but they're super rude
to everyone who comes in.

366
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,541
What is it with you
and getting told off

367
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,000
by pretty girls, man?

368
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:29,916
[RED HOODIE MAN]
And they never actually bring

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
you what you order.

370
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,416
[GREEN HOODIE MAN] Well,
this should be interesting.

371
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,250
Hey!

372
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,875
[TSUGUMI]
What are you doing here?

373
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,083
We just thought we'd
stop by and see you.

374
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,250
Fine by me. Come on in, then.

375
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,041
You know, Anya's been
pretty worried about you

376
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,416
and that head wound of yours.

377
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,041
[ANYA] That's not true.
I just came for some tea.

378
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,416
Wow! Everyone's here.

379
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,750
You said
something about a fight.

380
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,125
We wanted to see it.

381
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,166
The fight is
actually over already.

382
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,708
[KIM] And I bet you lost, right?

383
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,000
[TSUGUMI] I did not!

384
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,291
--[MEME] You lost.
--[ANYA] Yes, you did.

385
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,500
You're going to find this place 

386
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,541
a lot different
than where you lived before.

387
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,041
[MASTER] There's no need
to be defiant, nor should

388
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,291
you try to ingratiate
yourselves to everybody.

389
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,500
[MASTER] Here we accept a
person's soul for what it is.

390
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:18,541
That's just how Death City
works. We are who we are.

391
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,375
People don't have
to like us to accept us.

392
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,583
[MASTER]
Now, get to work.

393
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,208
Go on, grab a seat.
We're ready to take your order.

394
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,500
Take our order, huh?

395
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,208
Don't you mean
decide what it is?

396
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,458
You may be right.

397
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,000
'Kay!
I would like one pilaf please!

398
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,083
That's gagantous!

399
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,750
Sorry to bug you
with this on your day off.

400
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,250
It's okay. We get it.

401
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,333
We're the ones who
brought him in, after all.

402
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,000
Besides, it's not like
you had any other plans today.

403
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,416
Might as well be here.

404
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,375
Oh, like you did have plans?

405
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,375
The suspect will be
transferred straight from here

406
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,875
to a special
area below the DWMA.

407
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,333
That's where you
two come in. I want you

408
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,916
to accompany the police
when they do the transfer.

409
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,083
[siren]

410
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,916
You two, after him!

411
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,625
[BOTH] Right!

412
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,500
Can you tell me
what happened here?

413
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,666
I'm not sure.

414
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,250
One of the men
just suddenly went crazy.

415
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,916
[POLICEMAN]
He got the suspect.

416
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,500
[WOMAN] Always remember.
While you are sleeping, 

417
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,666
we are still
awake and we keep moving.

418
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,041
[ANYA] The Death Bazaar!

419
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,750
The incredible
festival where commoners gather

420
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,916
to sell of all the
junk they no longer want!

421
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,625
Oh, look!
A bear eating fish!

422
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,000
How neat!

423
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,666
[TSUGUMI] A bear-eating
fish or a fish-eating bear?

424
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,958
[MEME] Wait, who's
eating who? I'm confused.

425
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,500
[ANYA] This place
is like a garbage dump.
