It's all coming back to me.

158

Yesterday, I went out for
a jog along Grissom Street.

159

Why don't you try pulling
a street stall while you run?

[MEME] That seemed
to make sense at the time.

00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,083
So I pulled the souvenir
cart as fast as I could.

163
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,041
I was going too fast, though,
and at the turn I crashed!

164
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,708
I didn't know how I would
pay for it all, but then...

Come on,

167

[MEME] I hit the jackpot,
and won all the money I needed.

The proprietor was
in tears when I left.

169
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,916
But then I forgot what
I was in the middle of doing.

170
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,833
And as for the reason I was even
out jogging in the first place.

171
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,416
Yeah, that's where
you come in, isn't it?

172
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
[MEME] I was jumping
rope in the park and there

173
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,041

boy out walking his sloth.

174
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,166
What was it he
said to me, again?

Hey!

[MEME] After leaving the casino
and returning to the dorm,

182
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,750
I ran into Eternal Feather

184
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,875
And then I went into the
bathroom and got on the scale.

185
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,666
How is that possible?

186
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,916
[MEME] I was
shocked by what it told me.

Determined to lose even
the smallest amount of weight,

188
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,166
I shaved off my eyebrow.

Losing so much time

[TSUGUMI] Growing up,
there was a vacant lot where I'd

216
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,500
play baseball with my
brother and my dog, Pochi.

217

Indeed? I've never heard

Woo-hoo!

In that case, I nominate
you to be the first up to bat.

224
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,333
Meanwhile, I'll take
over the pitcher's mound.

225
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,750
Right! Then I'll
take fly position!

[TSUGUMI]
Ah, there she goes again.

227
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,750
First off, "fly" is not a
position, it's a type of ball, 

228
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,000
one that the batter
hits high up in the air. Now,

as for the positions you can
cover, they're either right--

there she goes again.

You'll never hold

Okay.

baseball works in simple terms.

here and I'm going to pitch it

242
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,708

And you'll hit it with the bat.

Just like this!

Pretty simple, huh?

00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,833
What? That's all
baseball is? It sounds boring.

246

How could you say
such an awful thing?

247

Real baseball is

the bat, then, won't I?

them a package containing

306
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,291
some objects that represent
my time here and let them

307
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,166
draw their own
conclusions from that.

308
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,375
Okay.
And what about you?

309
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,958
You know, I'm having
a little trouble remembering.

310
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,750
[TSUGUMI] Is she
just dodging my question?

311
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,875
What are you
doing now, Meme?

312
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:49,583
[light whistling]

313
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,583
What are those?

314
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,000
They're not messenger
pigeons, they're messenger bats?

315
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,750
[SID] No further developments in
the Shaula investigation? She's

316
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,583
kept a low profile since the
incident with Eternal Feather.

317
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,666
If she's a mind-control
witch like we believe,

318
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,250
I doubt she can
be too far away.

319
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,541
That said, we still don't have
any leads as to her location.

320
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,333
There's something else.

321
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,875
It may have nothing to
do with the witch, but...

322
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,750
It appears there's been a recent
string of robberies at the DWMA.

323
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,791
This is a list
of the stolen items.

324
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,583
The restricted
browsing collections

325
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,041
and investigation records?

326
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,583
[SID] That's very
sensitive information for

327
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,750
someone to be targeting.

328
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,833
A list of
meisters and weapons, too?

329
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,708
[CLAY] Like he said,
we haven't been able

330
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,666
to link these to Shaula.

331
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,125
If you can find a connection,
this could be the break we've

332
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,875
been waiting for. I want you
to keep running this down, okay?

333
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,250
Yes, sir.

334
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,416
That's all for today, then.

335
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,583
As usual, thank you
for staying so late.

336
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,625
It's not a problem.
We're happy to help.

337
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,500
[SID] You know you can't enter
the Battle Festival this year.

338
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,083
[CLAY]
We figured as much.

339
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,875
It's a tournament for the EAT
class, after all. Since we're

340
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,708
NOT students now, it would
look weird for us to compete.

341
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,291
That's all right.

342
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,958
We can just dress up and go
get some free candy, instead.

343
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,166
Huh?

344
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,291
The Battle Festival
is held on Halloween.

345
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,416
Or we could dress up as
witches to go hunt witches!

346
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,708
Are you serious?

347
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,375
[AKANE] For working
in intelligence, you sure

348
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,125
are gullible, huh, Clay?

349
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,958
Oh, leave me alone!

Festival it's either Meme,

363
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,916
or it's me. Until then, we'll
keep switching off, day by day.

[MEME] I'm sorry! I'm really
sorry I hurt you, Tsugumi.

368
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,208
[TSUGUMI] Meme, wait!
Meme, where are you going?

369
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,000
[ANYA] I can't believe
we're parting like this!

370
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,708
[TSUGUMI] Anya,
no! You're going, too?

371
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,750
What's happening?
Maybe it's all just a dream.
