1
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,334
[ANYA]
Help me, somebody! Please!

2
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,089
[TSUGUMI]
Why am I here? What's going on?

3
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:41,841
Quick! We need to you
to transform, Tsugumi!

4
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:44,386
I can't! You know I can't!

5
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:46,930
[TSUGUMI] I'm not a fighter.

6
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:57,107
[screams]

7
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:12,080
She never seems
to stay in her own bed.

8
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:25,552
Or fully clothed.

9
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,514
So this is how it
feels to be homesick.

10
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,268
I've got to snap out of it!
Wake up!

11
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,151
Awake already, huh?
Well, good morning.

12
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,069
How'd you sleep?

13
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,660
Uh-oh, what'd I
do with my glasses?

14
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:35,872
[ANYA] Uh, Meme, I'm pretty
sure you don't wear glasses.

15
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,540
[MEME] Huh? I don't? Really?

16
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:40,335
[ANYA] Give it a minute.
You're still half asleep.

17
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,462
Nice day out, isn't it?

18
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:43,922
Yes, looks like it so far.

19
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,382
Sure. Nice day, I guess.

20
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,217
I'm gonna go wash my face.

21
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,885
Try not to fall back asleep.

22
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,387
So, what should
we have for breakfast?

23
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,846
I'm really hungry.

24
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,349
Awake for two minutes and
already talking about food?

25
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,767
Uh?!

26
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,227
[TSUGUMI] For a dainty
girl, you've got a big appetite.

27
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,396
No, I'm just trying to
keep up with you commoners.

28
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,772
[TSUGUMI] Oh, is that right?

29
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:01,981
You know what? Never mind.

30
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:03,775
I'm going to wash my face.

31
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,860
I'll see
you soon, then.

32
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,738
Wait. I'm coming, too!

33
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:41,581
[MEME] You want to
know why I came to the DWMA?

34
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,083
Let me think.

35
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,501
[TSUGUMI] As a weapon,
I didn't have much choice

36
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,504
if I wanted to control
my abilities, but since

37
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,089
you're meisters, I thought
you'd have other reasons.

38
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:52,342
Well, I don't
remember. I'm sorry!

39
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,468
You forgot?

40
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,387
Something as
important as that? Really?

41
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,555
All right,
what about you, Anya?

42
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:59,307
I don't know if I
feel like answering that.

43
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,851
It's a rather personal
question, don't you think?

44
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,062
Oh, I guess so.

45
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,439
[ANYA] Come, it's
almost time for class.

46
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:09,526
It's a meister class, so
it's just you guys, right?

47
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:12,404
Just us. Well,
see you later, okay?

48
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,666
[TSUGUMI] One person's
reason for being here.

49
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,292
If I could hear
even one good reason,

50
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,712
I think that would help
me get through all the chaos.

51
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,507
[AKANE]
Harudori?

52
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,259
[TSUGUMI]
Oh, Akane.

53
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:36,594
Is something the matter?
You seem kind of down.

54
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,930
Well, I don't know
if I would say that.

55
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,640
Hey, there's a
mesiter class going on,

56
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,350
isn't there?
Shouldn't you be in it?

57
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:45,186
Not really. It's
okay if I skip this one.

58
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,438
They're just going
over fundamentals right now,

59
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,440
so it's no big deal.

60
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:52,402
Oh, okay. There, uh...

61
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,987
there's actually
something I wanted to ask you,

62
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,321
if it's alright.

63
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,700
Do you have a little
time to talk right now?

64
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:11,796
Now, then.

65
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,883
You want to know why
we meisters come to the DWMA.

66
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,760
Uh, yes. That's right.

67
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:18,595
Why would you choose
a life like this when you

68
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:20,597
know how dangerous it can be?

69
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,307
[AKANE]
A good question.

70
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,517
The specific reasons
vary from person to person,

71
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:27,479
of course, but I think a lot
of mesiters view the academy as

72
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,314
the start
of a career path.

73
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,649
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

74
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,651
[AKANE] The DWMA is
sometimes known as

75
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:36,571
the world's police force.
There are more than a few

76
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,367
graduates in political circles
of countries across the globe.

77
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,118
[AKANE] The school
is well respected.

78
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,579
A highly regarded, trusted
institution, which means most

79
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:47,749
countries are eager to
be affiliated with it. Its

80
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:52,212
popularity is part of the reason
the DWMA is so prosperous.

81
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:53,505
If peace could be
bought with money,

82
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,674
it wouldn't be so costly.

83
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:57,759
By now you've received
at least one week's worth

84
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,136
of allowance. I remember
thinking it was quite hefty

85
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,221
the first
time I got mine.

86
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:03,098
I thought so, too!

87
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,016
[AKANE] From what I've
heard, the powers that be

88
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,018
actually monitor the
way in which we students

89
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:10,438
manage our allowance.
Just something to keep in mind.

90
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,315
Of course, it's only
one way among many that

91
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,026
they evaluate how
good of a student you are.

92
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,236
[gasps]

93
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,572
Now, not everyone's like that.

94
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,366
And being part of
the academy isn't only

95
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,911
about authority and
power. The DWMA's motto is:

96
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:28,873
"A sound soul dwells within
a sound mind and a sound body."

97
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,126
[AKANE] Basically.
There are plenty of students

98
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:34,004
who come here because they
want to become heroes someday.

99
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,589
Is that your story?
Do you want to become a hero?

100
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,717
[AKANE] Hmm...
in my case,

101
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,261
you could say I
came for family reasons.

102
00:08:41,344 --> 00:08:43,763
Oh, then I guess that
means you're a legacy student.

103
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,390
[AKANE]
No.

104
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:48,059
I was born into a
family that runs a dojo.

105
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,312
This particular dojo still
teaches the ancient martial

106
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,858
arts, including techniques
that use lethal force.

107
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,737
Tell me, Harudori,

108
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,822
have you ever
heard of the Star Clan?

109
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:01,823
Mm-mm.

110
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:04,617
[AKANE] They're assassins
who will kill anyone for the

111
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:07,579
right price. and it just
so happens, the Star Clan is a

112
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:10,206
branch of the
school my family runs.

113
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,585
I actually wear glasses
as a kind of camouflage.

114
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,212
Seen up close, my
eyes can be disconcerting.

115
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,176
They are unique, huh?

116
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,136
I'd already been
taught how to fight.

117
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:24,387
I figured I
might as well take my

118
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,598
skills and use
them to help others.

119
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,725
[TSUGUMI] In that case, you
must be planning to move on to

120
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,352
the EAT classes, huh?

121
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,103
I certainly hope to.

122
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,732
I respect you even
more now, knowing you

123
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:39,819
have such a strong
reason for coming to the DWMA.

124
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:41,613
I only came because I
realized one day that

125
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,823
I was a weapon. I'm
not sure what I hope

126
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,326
the future holds for
me here, if anything.

127
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:48,953
Oh, I'm really
sorry! I'm babbling.

128
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:52,207
I didn't mean to make
this into a therapy session.

129
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,917
I'll shut up now.

130
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,340
[AKANE] You know,
you're kind of cute.

131
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,426
No! I'm not!

132
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,095
At least, I don't think so.

133
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,388
So what about you?

134
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,682
Do you hope to
advance to the EAT class?

135
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,809
No way!
I could never do that!

136
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:12,018
If I became an EAT student,

137
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:14,938
I would probably die
in less than a week!

138
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,648
I mean, I was
terrified just running into one

139
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:19,359
of those Traitor people.
Joining the EAT class

140
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,361
would be impossible for me.

141
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:23,571
What if you had
somebody looking out for you?

142
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,991
I could do that, you
know. If you joined EAT

143
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,035
I could protect you
from the Traitor guys

144
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,870
or anybody else,
for that matter.

145
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,248
Huh? What are you trying to say?

146
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,666
But to properly
look after you,

147
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,877
I'd need to be near
you at all times.

148
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,796
Um... be near me?

149
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,840
Tsugumi Harudori,
would you be mine?

150
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:42,716
[squeals]

151
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,975
Sweet Harudori.

152
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,936
My dear Akane.

153
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:03,028
[AKANE] You are mine.
I won't let you go.

154
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:09,659
[TSUGUMI] I always knew I
was in love with love, but could

155
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:12,162
this finally be the real thing?

156
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,294
[AKANE]
I'm joking.

157
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,628
Huh?

158
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,589
[AKANE] You're new.
You've only been at the DWMA

159
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,341
for two weeks,
right? So you don't know

160
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,551
what you want yet.
That's not surprising at all,

161
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:29,471
and there's no
reason to rush these things.

162
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:30,930
Wait a full year,
okay? And then,

163
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,308
if you're still worried,

164
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,226
I'll help you
figure something out.

165
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,523
[NAIGUS] To summarize,
there are three important

166
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,901
facts to remember
regarding weapons.

167
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,069
One.

168
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:45,445
They are the
descendents of family lines

169
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:48,865
that have weapon
genetic information. Two.

170
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,409
Their abilities typically
start exhibiting themselves at

171
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:56,039
puberty. And three, there
is a wide variety of forms--

172
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,333
Harudori!
Are you listening?

173
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,210
Yes, ma'am!

174
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,713
Three, there are wide variety
of forms that weapons can take.

175
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,301
[TSUGUMI] Sorry
to bother you, Clay.

176
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,681
What's up?

177
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,099
Well, it's about Akane.

178
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:15,767
Is he interested in anybody?

179
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,018
Huh?

180
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,603
I mean, is there somebody

181
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:22,399
in particular he cares about?
When that incident happened with

182
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,901
the Traitor, he did seem
to be awfully nice to Anya.

183
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:26,444
Maybe that's it!

184
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,406
[CLAY] Is it possible
she's caught onto our mission?

185
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:32,158
That's it, isn't it,
Clay? Anya is the one!

186
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:34,494
Akane loves her!

187
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:36,871
Right?

188
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,039
Eh?

189
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,000
[CLAY] Could that
be true? Of course not!

190
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,418
There's no way!

191
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,962
This girl sure gets right
to the point, doesn't she?

192
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,339
I'm going to have to
play this off somehow.

193
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,593
No, sorry, your
theory is incorrect.

194
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,095
Tatane is the one.

195
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,057
So Akane likes Meme?

196
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:58,143
Yeah, you know how it is.

197
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:00,520
An indisputable
fact. Men like big boobs.

198
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:01,938
Simple as that.

199
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:03,565
Yeah, of course they do.

200
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:05,191
Wait! Don't look so sad!

201
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,860
I was joking!

202
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,029
What? You're joking?

203
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,906
The truth is... I like you.

204
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,825
I have a giant
crush on you, Harudori.

205
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,246
You have a crush on me?

206
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:22,459
Let me see, here. It's
easier if I write it all down.

207
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,377
Where does Anya fit in?

208
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,713
Just a sec.

209
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,174
[CLAY]
Finished!

210
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:30,383
[TSUGUMI]
Huh?

211
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,886
This is just plain ridiculous.

212
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,805
Since when are we part
of an afternoon soap opera?

213
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,017
I've made a huge mistake.

214
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,352
Impressive.

215
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,771
How'd you manage to
complicate things this much?

216
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:44,147
This is awful.

217
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,149
That poor girl.
I bet she's off in a

218
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,068
corner somewhere
crying right now.

219
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,362
Don't say that.

220
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,323
[AKANE] I'll do what
I can to clear things up.

221
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,367
You know, Clay...
you're not really

222
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,828
cut out for intelligence work.

223
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:00,413
You noticed that, too?

224
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:09,089
I'm so confused.

225
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,424
I don't know what to believe.
Nothing Clay said makes sense,

226
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,468
but he wouldn't lie
about this stuff, would he?

227
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:14,844
What?

228
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,180
You want advice
about boys from me?

229
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,307
I just want to know
why they do the things they do.

230
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,519
For example, asking a girl out
and then saying it was a joke.

231
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:25,105
Or declaring their
undying love. when obviously

232
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:27,607
they're just trying to
cover up something for a friend.

233
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,111
[ETERNAL FEATHER] Maybe you
should tell me what's going on.

234
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:35,907
Oh, nothing!
It's all very hypothetical!

235
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,660
[GENTLE FEATHER] All right.
Let's see if I can help.

236
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:39,911
Boys are confusing.

237
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,579
When they like a girl,
they do strange things,

238
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,958
like lying and
insulting her. No one knows why.

239
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,836
It's an inexplicable
male courtship behavior.

240
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,379
We girls, on the other hand,

241
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,798
are far more straightforward
when we're interested in a boy.

242
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:53,883
I've learned a thing or
two since I've been here.

243
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,385
Hey, Eternal Feather.

244
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,721
Do you think I could borrow
your notes from class today?

245
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:00,807
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Sure. No problem. Here.

246
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,475
Great. Thank you.

247
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,729
See, it's really easy to
ask Eternal Feather for stuff.

248
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,439
It's like she's not even a girl.

249
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,441
[BOY STUDENT]
Yeah, that's true.

250
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,611
[ETERNAL FEATHER] Just
because I know a thing or two

251
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,488
doesn't mean it
does me any good.

252
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,409
Don't worry so much.

253
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,453
Money's more
important than boys.

254
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,543
[TSUGUMI] Clay and Akane
have been helpful, at least.

255
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,922
Isn't there anybody
else I can ask for advice?

256
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:34,549
[MAKA]
It's cause and effect, Soul!

257
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,343
If you'd gotten up earlier,
you would have been able

258
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,345
to eat the breakfast
I worked so hard to make,

259
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:39,554
which means we
wouldn't have fought,

260
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,597
which means
that I wouldn't have

261
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,182
had to kick you
through the window.

262
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:43,433
[SOUL]
Let it go already.

263
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:44,726
Excuse me, Maka!

264
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:47,687
Oh, it's you!

265
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:49,356
You're that
freshman from before.

266
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,732
Ah! You remember me!

267
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,150
It's a small world.

268
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,402
I wore a uniform
just like that once.

269
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,071
There's an
overwhelming number

270
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,947
of uniforms to choose from, huh?

271
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,824
[MAKA] You can pair
any top with any bottom,

272
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,659
and even street
clothes are okay.

273
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,620
Was it difficult for
you to choose which you wanted?

274
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:05,080
Yeah. Well, sort of.

275
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,832
I settled on this scarf
and this collar first,

276
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,542
and since I don't
have much of a figure,

277
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,211
I picked this shirt.

278
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,089
Soul mates!

279
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:16,549
Ow!

00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,551
Come on, stop
chatting. We're already late.

281
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,553
I know!
And whose fault is that?

282
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:22,263
Well, see ya around.

283
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,891
[TSUGUMI]
Please wait a second!

284
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,143
I just want you to
know, my name's Tsugumi.

285
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,395
and it may sound strange,

286
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:30,897
but I wear my hair
like this because of you.

287
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,066
I hope you don't mind.

288
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,152
Of course not!
It looks cute.

289
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,447
And there's one more thing!

290
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,159
It's just. I, uh... I
could use advice from somebody.

291
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:46,121
Do you know anything
about dreams and love and stuff?

292

Go with the flow.

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,750
[MAKA] Don't look
at me like that, Soul.

294
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:51,710
It's all your fault!

00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:52,502
[SOUL] Yeah, right.

00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,378
You can never admit...

00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:54,671
"Go with the flow"?

You have to tell my fortune!

About what?

00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,806
About love and my future!

About my hopes

Is a real tarot deck even
supposed to have this card?

308
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:26,870
It's an original.

309
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,830
Okay, so what
does it mean then?

310
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,707
It's the flat-chested card.

just modest, thank you.

What's that pose,
Meme? Are you doing yoga?

316
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,057
[MEME] Yoga is supposed
to improve the blood flow.

317
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,018
So I thought it
might help my memory.

318
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,394
Okay, sounds good.

Wow, that's amazing.

321
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,289
I'm useless.

322
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,417
I didn't accomplish
a single thing today.

323
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,009
This is getting old, Meme.

324
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:25,804
Do you have to end
up in my bed every night?

325
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,306
[TSUGUMI]
And why are you naked?

326
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:30,767
Actually, never mind.
I don't even want to know.

327
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,019
It looks like she's
gotten dirty in spots, too.

328
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,522
[ANYA] They're doing
physical fitness testing today.

329
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:37,065
You should be
careful not to use up

330
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,650
all your strength before class.

331
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,819
[TSUGUMI] What is that
supposed to mean, Anya?

Hurry and change.
They'll be starting soon.

333
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:49,869
[KIM] It's like being
followed around by a gnat.

[JACQUELINE] Hey!

00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:52,664
[KIM] Stop talking to
me, straight-edge.

Hey, where's Anya?

337
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,001
She hasn't come out of
the locker room yet, huh?

338
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,919
I wonder what's
taking her so long.

339
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:00,964
Commoners exercise in these?

340
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:01,840
Impossible!

341
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,551
The amount of flesh
they expose is disgusting!

342
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,803
You can see my
buttocks in these shorts!

343
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,763
I can't possibly
be expected to go out

344
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,682
in public dressed like this!

345
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,183
All right, then.

346
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,685
Those of you who

Oh, look, there she is.

Good timing.
We're starting.

[SID]
What are you doing, Anya?

351
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,571
You won't set
any records wearing

352
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,031
those baggy things.

353
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:28,450
Is there some sort
of problem with that?

354
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,702
Not at all. If it
doesn't bother you,

355
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:32,287
it doesn't bother me.

356
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,500
This is pretty
hardcore for a fitness exam.

357
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:38,710
There's shot put and everything.

He's really fast!

[BOY JUDGE]
Akane. 6.32. Clay. 10.18.

361
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,849
Don't you think
you're overdoing it a bit?

362
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,018
That was incredible.

00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:57,270
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
Okay, you're up next.

364
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,649
Test for Anya
Hepburn. Starting now.

365
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:14,829
1.87 meters, Anya!
That was fantastic.

366
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,290
That's the top score
among the new girls.

367
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,962
Test for Meme Tatane.
First shot put throw.

368
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,673
The third throw, actually.

[GIRL JUDGE]
That's 15.6 meters!

Nice!

00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,686
Her results are way
ahead of the other girls.

372

You know what
else is way ahead?

373
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:41,189
The shot puts
Tatane's got on her chest.

Tatane's test.

First shot...

You've done your test already.

Meme's good, too.

378
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:50,240
I wasn't really
sure how well she would

379
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:53,243
do on the exam, but that
shot put was pretty amazing.

[TSUGUMI] Meme and Anya
are both extraordinary.

Well, that was pathetic.

387

[TSUGUMI] Based on
today's results, I don't deserve

388
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,115
to partner with Anya or Meme.

They're too good
for someone like me.

I just sit around
thinking about useless stuff.

a specific goal or anything.

Instead, I've decided
to try as hard as I can.

I really don't want
to let Anya and Meme down.

Yeah, the whole thing
had me pretty confused.

Don't worry so much
about what others think.
