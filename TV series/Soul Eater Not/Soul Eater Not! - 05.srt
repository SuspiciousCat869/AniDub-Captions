1
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,083
Leave me alone.
I don't need a friend

2
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,375
or a partner, you got it?

3
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,666
Don't be like that!
Everybody needs--

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,666
Drop it! Go away!

5
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,541
Admit it, Kim.

6
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,458
You're not as bad as you let on.

7
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,166
Hmph. Think you're so smart.

8
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,375
Just because
you're in the EAT class.

9
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,333
Huh?

10
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,750
[JACQUELINE]
Okay, what was that for?

11
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,208
You're blushing.
What's that about?

12
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,708
Hey, you're blushing, too.

13
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,833
You're bright red, though.

14
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,208
Be quiet! I am not.

15
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,375
Oh, yes you are.

16
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,750
Uh, I didn't mean to--

17
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,500
You're pretty.
Did you know that?

18
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,541
Huh?

19
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,333
That was weird.

20
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,250
A dream!
It didn't mean anything!

21
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,458
Huh?

22
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,375
[TSUGUMI AND MEME]
Rock, paper, scissors!

23
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,791
One, two, three, throw!

24
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,125
Okay, are you ready? Now!

25
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,791
Hey! No fair!

26
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,375
I'll have to punish you more!

27
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,416
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,708
I don't understand you two.

29
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,458
Is that game really
supposed to be enjoyable?

30
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,375
It's fun! Do you want to try?

31
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,291
Such an unrefined game
might be beneath my dignity.

32
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,750
See, you have rock,
scissors, and paper.

33
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,708
That's simple enough.
Your commoner games are easy

34
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,416
for me to understand.
I suppose it won't hurt

35
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,583
if I agree to play one round.

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,833
Rock, paper, scissors!

37
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,000
Now I have the
urge to smack somebody.

38
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,500
I can't get all wound up like
this and then just walk away.

39
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,458
I have to do something.

40
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,916
What are you idiots up to?

41
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,375
We're not
doing anything, Kim!

42
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,625
What in the
world are you wearing?

43
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,250
That outfit
is plain indecent!

44
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
I just found us a sweet job.

45
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,208
Huh?

46
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,166
Come on.
Change into something

47
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,333
you don't mind getting wet.

48
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,125
You got us jobs
as pool cleaners?

49
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,250
That's right!
Any job where you can

50
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,625
play in the water while
making money is a good one.

51
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,416
It's hot, but that's no
reason to rot away in your room.

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,041
I wouldn't exactly
say we were "rotting away."

53
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,000
[POOL GUY]
Okay. It's all yours.

54
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,708
[KIM] Cool! My associates
here will do a great job.

55
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,916
[TSUGUMI] It's like something
out of a teen drama, isn't it?

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,041
[MEME] What, pool cleaning?

57
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,250
Oh, and one more thing.

58
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,166
Well, should we go
ahead and get started?

59
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
What's going on?
I didn't invite you here.

60
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,541
[JACQUELINE] You, me,
and one of those girls

61
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,458
will go get the cleaning
gear. After that, we'll--

62
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,250
What makes you think
you're in charge of things?

63
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,875
Just look at you.
It seems pretty obvious that

64
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,875
you haven't given this very much
thought. With me in the lead,

65
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,916
this job will proceed
smoothly and efficiently.

66
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,708
[KIM] I'll let you
handle the small stuff,

67
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,000
but I'm still the
official leader, understand?

68
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,333
[JACQUELINE]
I don't care. Whatever.

69
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,916
It's so dark in here.
I can't tell where anything is.

70
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,583
Right, I forgot about that.

71
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,291
You're a lantern, aren't you?

72
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,583
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,791
What do you think?
I can come in pretty handy.

74
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,750
Just don't get that
thing too close to me.

75
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,666
Shine it over there.

76
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,375
[KIM] Tsugumi!
Help me find the stuff we need.

77
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,416
Uh, right.

78
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,750
[MEME] Hey! Stop that!

79
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,541
You too, Anya!

80
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,583
Okay!

81
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,875
[TSUGUMI] That's such
a nice outfit, though.

82
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,625
[TSUGUMI] And, whoosh!

83
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,458
Why are you
all standing around?

84
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,625
[BOTH] Sorry, Jacqueline.

85
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,833
She's right, you two!

86
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,208
This is no time for silly games!

87
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,166
[KIM] Geez, you really
are a killjoy, aren't you?

88
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,833
[KIM] Let them
goof around a little.

89
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,625
Not allergic to
having fun, are you?

90
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,916
We need to
finish working first

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,958
and then after
that, we can play.

92
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,416
I'm planning
on having fun, too,

93
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,625
but there's a proper
order to doing these things.

94
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,291
You're a real piece of work.

95
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,125
Sucks to be whoever
ends up as your partner.

96
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,083
[SID] What's wrong?
Is there a problem?

97
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,875
Yes, there is.
Take a look at this,

98
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,583
if you would.

99
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,125
[SID] I recognize him.

100
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,333
He's that Traitor
from the other day.

101
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,250
The police currently
have him in custody.

102
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,958
We're holding him as a suspect,
and we've noticed something odd.

103
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,333
[DETECTIVE]
The man doesn't sleep.

104
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,916
What, not at all?

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,291
[DETECTIVE] As is our routine,
I looked into his background.

106
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,916
He has no criminal past.
Nor does he appear to have

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,625
any experience
with martial arts.

108
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,333
Until now, he was
very much a normal,

109
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,208
law-abiding man.

110
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,666
[SID] Very interesting.

111
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,541
It seems something changed
suddenly and inexplicably,

112
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,250
and then there's this
business about not sleeping.

113
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,000
That is correct.

114
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,000
Given the facts,
there's a possibility

115
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,250
that witches are
involved in this case.

116
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,041
The DWMA and the
witches are known

117
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,041
to have a longstanding
enmity. So naturally we thought

118
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,666
it would be best to
bring the matter to you.

119
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,750
[SID] You did the right
thing. We'll take this case.

120
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,250
I'll see that
arrangements are made to

121
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,958
transfer the
suspect into our custody.

122
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,791
Careful arrangements, I hope.

123
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,291
Of course, don't worry.

124
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,750
We aren't talking about
some young witch this time.

125
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,291
He won't be allowed to go free.

126
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,208
[TSUGUMI] Kim,
come look! We're all finished!

127
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,333
'Kay, be right
there. Gimme a second.

128
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,875
It's so shiny!

129
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,333
We did an excellent job!

130
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,916
Good job. You finished
that pretty quickly.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And here's what I owe.

132
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,625
Thank you!

133
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,500
[POOL GUY] Well.
I hope we can do this again.

134
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,250
Hey, lackeys, over
here! Come get your money.

135
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,958
[KIM] There. Just
split that up three ways.

136
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,916
Really? This is all we get?

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,125
It's really nice of
you to pay us in advance.

138
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,125
We haven't done anything yet.

139
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,833
We cleaned the entire pool.

140
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,833
Huh?

141
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,250
Working at the
café was a better deal.

142
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,125
We made a lot
more money doing that.

143
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,166
Yeah. A whole lot more.

144
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,541
Like candy from a baby.

145
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,833
[JACQUELINE] Kim.

146
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,500
I was wondering.

147
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,583
Since we finished
everything so quickly...

148
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, I know this place
that makes great ice cream.

149
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,416
Would you like to get some?

150
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,916
Huh? You've gotta be kidding me.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,083
Get some ice cream? Why
would I want to go anywhere

152
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,041
with somebody
who's as lame as you?

153
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,791
Please. You couldn't
even pay me to do that.

154
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,583
Sorry, um...
Jacqueline, excuse me.

155
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,833
What is it? Did
you need something?

156
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,541
I was wondering
if, by any chance...

157
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,500
You were hoping
that you and Kim

158
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,416
would become partners,
weren't you?

159
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,166
N-N-No! What are
you talking about?

160
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,708
We want to help you get
your wish. Please let us!

161
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,166
Huh?

162
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,250
[BOTH] "Us," huh?

163
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,541
What are you doing, Tsugumi?

164
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,708
You've been staring
at that thing for a while.

165
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,125
Her name is Josephine.

166
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,708
Oh. I was thinking.

167
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,041
It actually reminds me a
little bit of Kim, you know?

168
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,208
I see it.

169
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,041
[KIM] A raccoon dog!

170
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,375
If you value your life at all, 

171
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,916
I'd avoid
pointing that out to her.

172
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,250
[NARRATOR] The raccoon dog!

173
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,250
What? Do a
compatibility reading?

174
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,666
Yeah, trust me.

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,333
Kana's fortune telling
is always extremely accurate.

176
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,500
When it's all said and done,

177
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,083
it doesn't matter
how much you like Kim.

178
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,291
There's no
point in even trying

179
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,458
if you're not
compatible, you know?

180
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,875
What a refreshingly
blunt way of putting it.

181
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,250
Well, let's get to it!

182
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,291
The cards will now
tell us about your love life.

183
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,041
Are you sure this
is entirely accurate?

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,250
[KANA] First card.

185
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,000
You have a pumpkin fetish.

186
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:14,333
Excuse me? Ah!
What? How dare you?

187
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,416
Nobody talks to me
that way! A pumpkin fetish?

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,791
Okay, Kana, one
compatibility reading please.

189
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,375
Imagine the person
with whom you wish to test

190
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,666
your compatibility and then
choose a card from the deck.

191
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,958
Okay. Just picture her?

192
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,166
[KANA] Go ahead.

193
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,666
It's the Lovers.
Hooray for you. A perfect match.

194
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,291
A perfect match!
Isn't that great, Jacqueline?

195
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:48,875
Yeah.

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,875
Everybody!
I have an idea!

197
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,083
I think it's a
surefire way to land Kim.

198
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,208
Omelet rolls? That's your plan?

199
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,291
That's right.
It's her favorite food.

200
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,791
at least
according to her stalkers--

201
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,708
Sorry, I mean the
members of her fan club.

202
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,375
Anyway, it should
be accurate information.

203
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,000
[MISERY] Kim Diehl is
the obvious choice for

204
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,291
the private eye character
in The Commoner of Flanders.

205
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,666
It's pretty adorable
that this is her favorite food.

206
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,875
You were right about
this being a good idea.

207
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,083
Luring with food.
I think it's going to work.

208
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,875
Kim does act like a raccoon dog.

209
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,416
One problem.

210
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,083
Whipping up a good omelet isn't
exactly a specialty of mine.

211
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,625
Okay, then I'm
happy to do it for you.

212
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
Whenever my mom was too busy, 

213
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,375
I would make lunch for
my dad, my brother, and me,

214
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,791
so I got to be pretty
good at cooking simple dishes.

215
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,041
An omelet shouldn't be
too much trouble for me.

216
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,333
Well, aren't you
impressive, Tsugumi?

217
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,416
Wholehearted and a
skilled cook! Quite a combo.

218
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,458
You'll make some
man very happy one day!

219
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,416
Will she?

220
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,541
Let's ask little
miss wholehearted

221
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,583
why she can't seem
to decide on a partner.

222
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,000
Romance and partner selection
are two different things!

223
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,541
That's right!
They're totally different!

224
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,958
Huh?

225
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,708
But not for you, though,
right, Jacqueline? I mean, isn't

226
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,416
that the reason you want to
be partners with Kim so badly?

227
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,958
Huh? Well...

228
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,125
[JACQUELINE]
Wait, what is the reason?

229
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,666
[JACQUELINE] When I think
about Kim, I just know we would

230
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,625
make a good match as
partners. What does that mean?

231
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,208
Is that what love is? Is
it because she's so boyish?

232
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,333
No, she's got a
glamorous side, too.

233
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,708
There's no mistaking
the fact that she's a girl.

234
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,708
[JACQUELINE] I don't understand!
Why is it all so confusing?

235
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,375
She's on fire!
Should we do something?

236
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,750
She's a lantern, isn't she?

237
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,166
[TSUGUMI] Water! Get water!

238
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,416
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
I don't think pouring water on

239
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,666
her is such a good idea.

240
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,791
[MEME] Then a damp towel, maybe?

241
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,125
[TSUGUMI] She's going to die!

242
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,291
[ETERNAL FEATHER]
They say true love burns hot!

243
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,791
[JACQUELINE]
Shut up! I'm not in love!

244
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,000
They turned out
pretty well, didn't they?

245
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,416
You cooked them perfectly.

246
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,375
I guess you've got a lot
of experience with heat, though.

247
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,583
What am I smelling?

248
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,166
Kim!
We've got some rolled omelets.

249
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,958
[MEME] Would you
like one? Here, go ahead.

250
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,708
Jacqueline just decided
to whip some up for everybody.

251
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,666
Yeah? I'll take
one then. Thank you.

252
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,375
That's the one I made.
I hope it turned out well.

253
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,791
That's disgusting!
Can't you do anything right?

254
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,166
Let's try a different approach.

255
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,000
It's time to play
up those lovely looks of yours.

256
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,875
My looks?

257
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,625
Yes. "Operation: Show Off
Your Pretty Hair". Which we will

258
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,791
pair with "Operation: Casual
Conversation in the Bathroom."

259
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,541
It's especially
crowded today for some reason.

260
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,500
[TSUGUMI] Jacqueline,
your hair is so pretty!

261
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,875
Can you help me with mine? 

262
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,458
It's always
been so unmanageable,

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,833
and what's the
difference between rinse,

264
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,375
conditioner, and treatment?

265
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,875
Well, for starters, a
rinse coats the hair's surface.

266
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,333
That protects the
hair from any friction

267
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,083
and makes it feel nice and
smooth. However, conditioner

268
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,250
does a better job of keeping
the hair's surface manageable

269
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,666
than a rinse does.

270
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,000
A treatment has
the same essential

271
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,041
function as the
other two except that

272
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,083
it also treats
the inside of the hair.

273
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,458
A treatment is
what I use every day

274
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,041
to keep my hair shiny.

275
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,291
Oh, wow!
I'll never remember all that!

276
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,583
Becoming friends
with you will be

277
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,250
the best thing that
ever happened to my hair!

278
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,333
I can't wait!

279
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,833
You're going to
make us all so pretty!

280
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,291
So commoners do
know a thing or two!

281
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,666
What is this?

282
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,875
You trying to make fun of
my short hair or something?

283
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,583
You're leaving now?

284
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,083
But don't you want
to soak in the tub?

285
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,041
[KIM] I can't listen to
your chattering anymore.

286
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:01,875
I'm outta here!

287
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,500
She's a very mean
raccoon dog, isn't she?

288
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
Look. The Fool.

289
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,208
Here's a thought:
girls love birthdays, right?

290
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,958
Yeah, they absolutely do!

291
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,125
When someone
remembers your birthday,

292
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,166
it makes you
feel so special!

293
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,916
How many people's birthdays 
do you ever manage to remember?

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,666
Sure. Whatever you say, Tsugumi.

295
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,625
Right. Eternal
Feather, you're up.

296
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,791
Leave it to me.

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,333
What's all this?

298
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,166
[ETERNAL FEATHER] Just
some vital statistics on Kim.

299
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,416
[TSUGUMI] Did this
stuff come from that so-called

300
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,708
fan club, too?

301
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,416
[ETERNAL FEATHER] Yes.

302
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,083
[ANYA] Hmm. It even
lists her favorite color.

303
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,875
[MEME]
154 cm's!

304
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,208
[TSUGUMI]
Look at her measurements:

305
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:46,291
bust 81, waist 56, hips
79. She's got a nice body.

306
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,583
Hey, wait. Doesn't
this seem strange, though?

307
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Look at her birthday.
It's down as April 31st.

308
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,291
But that's impossible.
April only has thirty days.

309
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,708
Well, so much for that plan.

310
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,833
It won't work if we can't be 

311
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,625
absolutely certain
about her birthday.

312
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,000
Hold on.

313
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,666
Is it possible that Kim
doesn't remember it herself?

314
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,958
No, Meme, she isn't you.

315
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,291
Don't lose heart!

316
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,750
I'll go to the
girls' dorm and ask around.

317
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,958
[MEME] I'll come, too.

318
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,000
[ANYA] Me, as well.

319
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,083
The witch of
the girls' dorm, huh?

320
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,958
I think she's
originally from Spain, right?

321
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,958
I thought she
was born in Brazil.

322
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,958
Actually, you're both
wrong. I heard it was Tunisia.

323
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,500
Before coming here,
she was a child actress.

324
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,958
That's not right.
She was a gang member.

325
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,791
An alien from outer space.

326
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,125
Oh, that girl?

327
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,708
No, I've never talked
to her. I can't help you.

328
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,791
This isn't going well so far.

329
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,875
Seems like she doesn't want
people to know her background.

330
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,750
Well, we should
stop prying into it, then.

331
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,833
--Huh?
--What? Really?

332
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,416
Kim is who she is.

333
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,625
Knowing when she was born 

334
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,458
won't bring me
any closer to her.

335
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,500
And closeness is what I want.

336
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,375
I want her to know what
my very soul feels like.

337
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,833
And that means I need to be the
one to approach her, head-on!

338
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,666
That's what I'll do!

339
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,458
At this point, what do
you have left to lose, right?

340
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,541
I guess we didn't do you 

341
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,250
any favors by
meddling in your life.

342
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,458
Aw, it's okay.
You did your best.

343
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,625
I'm gonna go find Kim.

344
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,083
[ROBED TRAITOR]
It looks like the DWMA is going

345
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,541
to make its move.

346
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,083
[WOMAN] We've been
able to collect a fair amount

347
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:23,416
of experimental data.
However, it's still too soon.

348
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,416
We should start covering
our tracks, just to be safe.

349
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,250
[WOMAN] Witches are
the sworn enemy of the DWMA,

350
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,083
which means that I
cannot afford to be found.

351
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:39,208
If I wish to remain alive,
then I must conceal my past.

352
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,541
That's just temporary, however.

353
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,833
A witch's first
instinct is for destruction.

354
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,166
When all is said and done,

355
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,500
I'll teach them a lesson
in despair and loneliness.

356
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,166
The kind of lesson
I learned long ago.

357
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,291
It isn't my fault.
I didn't ask to be born a witch.

358
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,291
[barking]

359
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,500
[KIM] Go away!

360
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,208
I'm not like you.
I'm no stray dog,

361
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,000
all pathetic and lonely.

362
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,541
I'm by myself
because I choose to be.

363
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,250
[yelps]

364
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,083
[crash]

365
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,208
Just hold on. Hang in there! 

366
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,166
I can heal you.

367
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,625
What are you doing?
Stop already!

368
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,833
[JACQUELINE]
Amazing! You really healed him.

369
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,708
Were you using magic?

370
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,833
Of course not.

371
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,625
But that dog
was very badly injured.

372
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,625
I didn't do anything! Ok!

373
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:40,125
I know what, what they call you.
But are you an actual witch?

374
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,291
How can that be?
It's impossible!

375
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,250
It isn't my fault. It's not like
I asked to be born this way.

376
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,625
[KIM] I hated the
world of witches, so I ran away.

377
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,333
I thought if I was at the DWMA, 

378
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,208
I could cut my ties
to that life entirely.

379
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,291
I even cut off
all my beautiful hair.

380
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,333
I started dressing differently
and avoided everybody else

381
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,500
as much as I could.
And then you came along.

382
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,333
A stupid straight-edge chick
who wouldn't leave me alone.

383
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,083
I, um, I'm so sorry.

384
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,916
That's it. I'm done.

385
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,208
Let go!

386
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,375
That's not happening!

387
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,208
Stop it!
What do you want from me?

388
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,291
It's all right, Kim.

389
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,583
[JACQUELINE] It's all right.

390
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,583
It's like you said.
I'm totally straight-edge,

391
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,041
which means I follow
the rules and keep secrets.

392
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,916
[KIM] Really? And you
expect me to just believe you?

393
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,791
I'll tell you what

394
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,083
you can buy me
something to keep me quiet.

395
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,125
[KIM] Huh?

396
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,625
I know a place that makes
the most delicious ice cream.

397
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,500
Yeah.

398
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,250
Yummy! Ah!

399
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,916
Why did you bring those
three idiots along with you?

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,291
Money is tight, here.

401
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,166
Think about it
this way, you're making

402
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,458
up for shortchanging
us on our pay earlier.

403
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,416
[KIM] You should
watch that smart mouth!

404
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,291
[ANYA] Let's get another.

405
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,125
[KIM] Hey!

406
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,333
[MEME] That's a great idea!

407
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,333
[JACQUELINE]
At first I thought I wanted to

408
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,083
come here alone
with Kim. But now,

409
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,625
now I realize
what I've been feeling

410
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,291
toward her isn't
really love, after all.

411
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,041
About earlier, um, that'll
stay between the two of us,

412
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,083
won't it?

413
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,541
I guess I can trust you,
but only because you're such

414
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,500
a good little girlie.
So you better stay that way.

415
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,416
And one more thing, from now on,
you and I are partners, okay?

416
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,416
Hold on, did you say?

417
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,125
[TSUGUMI]
Two devil-girls suddenly appear

418

at Deathbucks Café.

419
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,375
My special place is
being taken away from me!

420
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,916
I won't give in!
I'm a weapon, after all.

421

[ANYA] Scissors beats paper.

00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,125
[MEME] Today's lunch
special for me, please!

00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,541
One pilaf, please!
