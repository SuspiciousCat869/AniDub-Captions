1
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,958
[MALE TEACHER] Now that you
are officially DMWA students,

2
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,833
you share an important
responsibility. It is our

3
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,833
sincere hope that we
can all work together over

4
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,125
the coming years to
fight evil and uphold that

5
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,041
which is good and
right in the world.

6
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,833
Weapons and meisters
such as yourselves...

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,250
[screams]

8
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,333
[TSUGUMI] The cafeteria
here is really designed

9
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,375
to cater to global
tastes, isn't it?

10
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,833
That sure doesn't make
deciding what to eat very easy.

11
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,250
Huh?

12
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,250
[TSUGUMI] Interesting
selection. Not exactly balanced.

13
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,875
Yeah? Just look
at Anya's tray, then.

14
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,666
Wow.

15
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,708
[TSUGUMI] She's not
afraid to take what she wants,

16
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,916
even when it comes to breakfast.

17
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,208
Maybe we should cook something
in the dorm kitchen tonight.

18
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,625
Us? Cook?

19
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,041
[TSUGUMI] We're eating
breakfast and lunch in the

20
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,416
cafeteria. If we cook,
we can save some of our money.

21
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,333
I want to apologize.

22
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,250
Oh! Apologize?
Why? What for?

23
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,750
It was my fault! I feel awful!

24
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,791
Huh?

25
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,583
I saw. I was
watching when the witch

26
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,500
of the girls' dorm took all
your allowance money from you,

27
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,000
but I was too
scared to stop her.

28
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,583
Oh.

29
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,083
This is my treat, okay?

30
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,291
So the witch you
keep talking about isn't

31
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,416
the housemaster
like I thought, but that

32
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,208
edgy-looking girl
with the pink hair?

33
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,750
That's right.
Her name's Kim Diehl,

34
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,916
and she's in my class. She's
changed a lot since coming here.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
[ETERNAL FEATHER] When we
first started at the academy,

36
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,208
she had long, pretty hair and
a preppy sort of look. The kind

37
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,500
of girl everyone likes.
But then she began acting out

38
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,958
and stuff, so people
started steering clear of her.

39
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,125
What do you
mean "acting out"?

40
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,166
What sort of thing did she do?

41
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,708
For example.

42
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,375
You know what
everyone calls me, right?

43
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,375
Sure: Infinite Plume.

44
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,375
Of course.
You're Eternal Feather.

45
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,958
So, what do
you guys think?

46
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,625
It's an unusual name.
Unique, one might say.

47
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,500
It's pretty embarrassing, huh?

48
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,333
Yes. I hate it.
And it's Kim's fault.

49
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,333
She's the one who gave it to me.

50
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,791
Huh?

51
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,166
It's another thing that
makes this school out of

52
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,625
the ordinary. Students
can choose "stage names."

53
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,416
In fact, there's
even a weapon here

54
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,250
who decided he wanted
to be called "Soul Eater."

55
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,625
Anyhow, back when I
first started at the DWMA.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
You should
take a stage name.

57
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,541
I bet it would help your image.

58
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,625
Oh, yeah? 

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you really
think that's necessary?

60
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,083
Hey guys. Say hi to my
new friend Eternal Feather!

61
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,625
Hey! Wait a sec!

62
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,958
[ETERNAL FEATHER] Then
she submitted a stage name

63
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,416
request form to the
school for me. Those can't be

64
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,291
changed for two whole
years. What's worse?

65
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,166
I'll take that
name change fee.

66
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,458
Jerk!

67
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,500
Oh, great. There she is now.

68
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,750
It looks like
she's talking to

69
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,083
that boy about something.

70
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,625
A male friend!
Maybe she's more popular

71
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,000
than you thought.

72
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,250
Interesting. That guy
is in the same class as me.

73
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,166
His name is Oxford. He
got the top grades in our year.

74
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,250
Almost all of the boys
have steered clear of Kim

75
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,833
for a while now.
But Ox still seems friendly.

76
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,125
I guess he's the exception.

77
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,625
Hey good timing, Sid. Do you
remember those Traitor guys?

78
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,875
It looks like they're back.

79
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,083
Them again? Are you sure?

80
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,500
That's sixteen
times this month alone.

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,375
This is getting out of control.

82
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,125
[AKANE] Hey, Sid.

83
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,333
We think these Traitor
guys are probably just out

84
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,958
to prove something, right?
That means we might be able to

85
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,916
drive them off with
a show of strength.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,250
We just happen to
have some free time

87
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,375
on our hands right
now. We could go.

88
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, yeah?
That'd be good.

89
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,250
Akane. Clay. Since you're
actually EAT-level students,

90
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,500
this shouldn't be hard for
you to handle on your own,

91
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,833
but don't get careless.

92
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,500
Right.

93
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,833
[MEME] Oh, no.
There are only two

94
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,916
of the strawberry tarts left.
What should we do?

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,041
Why don't you
two take them.

96
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,166
I can just have one
next time instead.

97
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,333
No. On second
thought, I think I'll pass.

98
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,708
Yeah. me, too.

99
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,166
Why? It's really okay
for you to have them.

100
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,791
[bell tolls]

101
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,541
Oh, the bell.

102
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,083
You see? All three of us can
eat them together next time.

103
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,083
Sounds great.

104
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,291
[MEME] Come on, Tsugumi!
Class is going to start soon.

105
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,375
Oh, right!

106
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,791
[CLAY] Is that him?

107
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,958
[BLUE SHIRT TRAITOR]
Tell me something.

108
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,750
How was your sleep last
night? Was it restful?

109
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,541
Clay.

110
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,458
Yeah.

111
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,041
[CLAY] All you should
have to do is threaten him.

112
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,083
He should back
down pretty quick.

113
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,375
Yeah, I got it.

114
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,208
This fight is
as good as over.

115
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,916
You might as well give up now.

116
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,750
Hey!

117
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,875
I wasn't expecting that.

118
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,333
[SID] The DWMA is broadly
separated into two categories.

119
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,416
You all, like ninety
percent of the students here,

120
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,416
are attending the
noncombatant classes.

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,916
Also known as
"Normally Overcome Target,"

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,875
or just NOT, for short. In
time, some of your abilities

123
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,625
will advance enough
that you'll be moved to our

124
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,166
combatant classes.
Those courses are what we call

125
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,583
"Especially Advantaged
Talent." Around here they're

126
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,458
more commonly
referred to as EAT.

127
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,500
While you all are not
classified as fighters,

128
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,666
it's still important for
you to be able to control your

129
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,000
weapon abilities.
Otherwise, you could end up

130
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,875
accidentally injuring somebody.

131
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,291
As weapons you will find
that you are sometimes feared.

132
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,333
Or discriminated against.
Or just avoided.

133
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,375
Hey, Sid. Sorry we're so late.

134
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,625
I just couldn't tear
him away from the arcade.

135
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,916
That again?

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,875
The arcade, is it?
What are you, Clay, twelve?

137
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,708
So, how did it go?

138
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,958
[AKANE] It was weird. There
was something really "off"

139
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,208
about this guy. Normally
we would have sent him on his

140
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,666
way and that would be that,
but we thought he should be

141
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,166
thoroughly checked out.

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,916
[SID] I see. Good work, you two.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,958
Well, find your seats.
And no more interruptions!

144
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,250
[TSUGUMI] Clay looks
so serious right now,

145
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,541
but he's actually
kind of flaky, isn't he?

146
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,083
I hadn't noticed.

147
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,458
[CLAY] Whoops! Sorry about that!

148
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,208
Told ya.

149
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,208
You were right.

150
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,958
[OX] Hello everyone!

151
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,833
I'm with Death Deliveries. 

152
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,500
I've got a large order of
coffee beans here for the café.

153
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,791
I've been waiting for those.

154
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,583
Akane, look, it's Ox--

155
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,250
Ford.

156
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,125
We've seen him around
school, like everybody else.

157
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,750
Death Deliveries, huh?

158
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,208
Yeah, for now at least.

159
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,291
I see that you guys
are hard at work, too.

160
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,958
An honor student
and a working man.

161
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,625
Quite a catch. I wonder
if he uses his paycheck

162
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,083
to buy things for the witch!

163
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,500
Shh!

164
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,375
Shh? What an
interesting sound!

165
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,625
Huh?

166
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,541
[MASTER] I think
we've slowed down enough

167
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,583
for you ladies to
take your breaks now.

168
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,625
[TSUGUMI] Great!

169
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,041
[MASTER] I poured you
some tea. Drink it in back.

170
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,666
This is delicious.

171
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,875
You think so?
Just tastes like tea.

172
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,208
Ooh! It smells so good.

173
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,833
Nice and soothing, isn't it?

174
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,458
Exactly!

175
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,958
[TSUGUMI] Excuse me, Master?

176
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,375
Hmm?

177
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,125
You told us before
that most customers come

178
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,000
to Deathbucks Café
because they want to see

179
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,875
what DWMA students are like.

180
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,708
Mm-hmm.

181
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, I think they
come here because

182
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,083
the drinks you
make are so tasty!

183
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,166
[MEME] You've really
never cooked before?

184
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,500
Not a single thing?

185
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,000
How could I? I was never
allowed into the kitchen.

186
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,375
High-class young lady!

187
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,041
Uh! You two be quiet!

188
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,708
[MEME] So, what about you?

189
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,916
[TSUGUMI] Me?

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,291
[MEME] Yeah, do you
have a specialty dish?

191
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,250
Sh!

192
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,791
[humming]

193
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,083
[clears throat]

194
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,083
The kitchen is a common
area. We don't have to leave.

195
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,791
I don't remember saying you did.

196
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,791
We won't interrupt
whatever you're doing, though.

197
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,500
Hey, uh, Kim?

198
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,666
Yeah?

199
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,375
Would you, would you,
maybe, like to eat with us?

200
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,125
Huh?

201
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,083
Eh?

202
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:00,916
[dings]

203
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:03,875
[KIM] Why would I?

204
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,708
Oh! No reason, I guess.

205
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,083
I just figured we'd have lots
of curry and maybe you would

206
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,791
like it better than eating
alone. I didn't mean to, uh,

207
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,833
well, I'm sorry
if I offended you.

208
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,625
The only way I would
eat with you three is if

209
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,500
you paid me first.

210
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,250
So we're making
curry tonight, then?

211
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,625
Because this is
what I bought to put in.

212
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,666
[TSUGUMI] What?
Where are the potatoes?

213
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,875
[MEME] I dunno. I think
pumpkin curry could be good.

214
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,750
[ANYA] Sometimes
you're impossible, Meme.

215
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,208
[SID] Remember, controlling
your weapon abilities is

216
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,958
helpful in several ways. You
don't have to leave the attack

217
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,041
totally up to your meister. They
have real-world applications,

218
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,041
as well. You might be
surprised at what you can do.

219
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,791
[SID] Jacqueline, please begin.

220
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,708
Right.

221
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,666
The EAT class students
are seriously impressive,

222
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,041
aren't they?

223
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,000
[SID] All right. I want
you all to split into pairs,

224
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,916
meisters, for today, your
job is to support the weapons.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,958
Well, um...

226
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,750
You and Meme were
partners last time, Tsugumi.

227
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,875
You know what that means. Today
I'm the one with you, right?

228
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,583
Oh, yeah? Is that
how it works, then?

229
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,125
That's correct, and
taking turns is very important.

230
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,125
It's only fair.

231
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,250
Okay. I can't
argue with that.

232
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,291
[SID] Haven't you
sorted yourselves out yet?

233
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,208
Anya, come over here.
This guy needs a partner.

234
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:35,916
Looks like it's you.

235
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,958
Hold on! No! Wait!
Stop it! Today is my turn...

236
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,916
She's not happy, huh?

237
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,833
[SID] Okay, let's begin.

238
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,833
All right, then.
Should we get started?

239
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,375
Yeah, we might as well.

240
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,833
So, it seems we're
partners for today.

241
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:55,958
Yeah.

242
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,958
[TSUGUMI] Hold on! Stop that!

243
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,833
Don't touch me there
before I transform!

244
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,875
It tickles and then
I can't concentrate!

245
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,208
Yeah?

246
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,625
I didn't know you were
ticklish! What about that?

247
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,083
Does that tickle?

248
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,291
[TSUGUMI] Stop that! 

249
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,500
Well, we should get
started, shouldn't we?

250
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,375
Yeah.

251
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,333
[MEME] If you keep
laughing like that,

252
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,083
we'll never get any work done!

253
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,500
No! Stop it, Meme!

254
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,958
[MEME] Tickle, tickle, tickle!

255
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,875
[SID] Good work today, kids.

256
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,000
You ready, Anya?

257
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,958
We're heading back to the dorm.

258
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,458
Where is she?

259
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,250
Sorry. The girl you
were partnered with, Anya,

260
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,791
has she already left?

261
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,583
Yeah.

262
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,041
But we usually we
all walk home together.

263
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,708
Why did she leave?
She doesn't like to be alone.

264
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,625
[ANYA] It's fine.
I don't really care.

265
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,875
One of us has to be split
from the others, anyway.

266
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,666
Those two have started to
seem very chummy lately.

267
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,250
Maybe it's my fault for
being so formal with them.

268
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,083
They might find me
standoffish or something.

269
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,541
I can't help it. That's
how I was taught to behave.

270
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,250
If only Tsugumi
wasn't so indecisive

271
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,583
in the first place! At
some point she's going to

272
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,458
have to choose
between me and Meme.

273
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,625
[BLUE HOOD TRAITOR] Hello,
girl. You're from the academy.

274
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,416
[BLUE HOOD TRAITOR]
Tell me something.

275
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,458
How did you sleep last night?

276
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,708
[ANYA] What is this?
What do you want?

277
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,708
[BLUE HOOD TRAITOR]
I only do what I'm told.

278
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,875
You're rather
creepy, you know that?

279
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,916
[ANYA] What are you doing?

280
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,583
You aren't playing games.
You're serious about this.

281
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,416
[ANYA] I did flee the
castle because life had become

282
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,041
so very dull. I don't
know that I was looking

283
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,333
for this much
excitement, though.

284
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,916
I don't think I've
ever been so grateful for

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,291
the karate lessons
I was forced to take.

286
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,458
That isn't nice! How dare you!

287
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,041
[ANYA] Somebody help me!

288
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,291
Great timing. Thanks.

289
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,041
[MEME]
Sure, no problem.

290
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,708
Who is that guy? It doesn't
look like he's from school.

291
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,458
[ANYA] No. I've never
seen him before this.

292
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,625
He's a creep.
I'll let him have it!

293
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,125
You need to be careful, Meme!

294
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,041
That man's no ordinary opponent.

295
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,791
I mean it.
He's a serious fighter.

296
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,083
Don't worry, it's all right.

297
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,416
You know how
scatterbrained I am.

298
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,250
I never remember to be afraid.

299
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,208
I got here as
fast as I could.

300
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,291
[ANYA] You came, too?

301
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,791
Quick, Tsugumi! Transform!

302
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,458
You know I ca--

303
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,666
Are you okay?

304
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:32,958
 Stay back!

305
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,458
[TSUGUMI] What are you
doing here? I mean, thanks!

306
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,083
[CLAY] You all just
stay where you are.

307
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,083
[AKANE] Neither they nor
we are agents of the DWMA,

308
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,000
understand?

309
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,541
We're not very powerful.

310
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,166
I doubt we would prove
much of a challenge for you.

311
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,541
You might as well leave.
You'd be wasting your time here.

312
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,583
[evil laugh]

313
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,916
Didn't take much
convincing to get him

314
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,333
to hit the road, huh?

315
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,000
Anya! Are you okay?

316
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

317
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,500
Sure?

318
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,666
Yes.

319
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,250
It's all right. 

320
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,083
We'll see that she gets
back to the dorm safely.

321
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,708
[TSUGUMI] Okay. In that case, 

322
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,875
we'll tell Master you
won't make it into work today.

323
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,750
[AKANE] Great, thanks.

324
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,458
[mischievous laugh]

325
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,083
[TSUGUMI] Thanks
for everything.

326
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,166
It's been a great week!

327
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,416
[MASTER] You did good work. 

328
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,166
Give my regards to the others.

329
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,916
[MEME] Sure.

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,875
You can
stop by anytime.

331
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,000
Thank you again.
We'll see you soon!

332
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,083
[MEME] Wow! This week
really flew by, didn't it?

333
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,416
Hold on. Has it
been a week or a month?

334
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,750
You had it right.
Just a week.

335
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,291
Just who I was looking for!

336
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,916
Which of you is Tsugumi?

337
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,250
That would be me.

338
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,125
[OX] Take this. You should
find it's the exact amount of

339
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,833
the school allowance Kim Diehl
took from you the other day.

340
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,833
Huh?
I don't get it.

341
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,875
Isn't that the money you
earned from your job, Ox?

342
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,875
It's okay. That
was the whole reason

343
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,208
that I got a job, so
I could pay this back.

344
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,458
[TSUGUMI] Oh, wow.

345
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,833
And in return, 

346
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,125
will you do me a favor
and not hold it against Kim?

347
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,791
Everybody at the
academy is afraid of her.

348
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,250
I know they call her the
witch of the girls' dorm.

349
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,583
But I think she
wants people to avoid her.

350
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,708
[OX] What I don't know is why.

351
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,166
I really hope it's
not asking too much,

352
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,500
but do you think we could
just call this even for now?

353
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,541
Huh?

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,583
Okay, I'll take
that as a yes.

355
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,958
Sorry about everything!
Enjoy spending your allowance!

356
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,000
Man, what an idiot.

357
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,833
Well, that was
certainly unexpected.

358
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,583
He's got it bad for her.
Really, really bad.

359
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,791
Maybe. I can see why.

360
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,500
Sure, Kim can
be scary sometimes,

361
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,708
but there's
something cool about her, too.

362
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,083
And besides, she hums
while she's heating up food.

363
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,791
That means she can't
really be a witch, right?

364
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,375
[MEME] I wouldn't be so sure.

365
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,958
My arm doesn't
look too good.

366
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,875
I wonder if that claw
thing was laced with poison.

367
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,833
[TSUGUMI] Hey, we're home!

368
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,000
How are you holding up?

369
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,416
That was rough toda--
Hey, what's wrong?

370
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,166
[TSUGUMI] Anya, you have an
injury you didn't tell us about,

371
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,125
don't you?

372
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,166
Oh, it's just a scratch. 

373
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,958
Nothing to worry about, really.

374
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,250
Doesn't she look a
little feverish to you?

375
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,833
What's the school
nurse's name again?

376
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,166
We should have her look at Anya.

377
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,666
You're right.
We should get Medusa.

378
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,541
This is serious.
You're burning up!

379
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,833
I told you I'm fine.
Now go away.

380
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,375
We're not leaving you.

381
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,625
That's enough, new kid.
Stand back.

382
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,208
Oh, I didn't see you there.

383
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,625
All right. Let me
see that wound blondie.

384
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,625
[ANYA] Why do you want to--

385
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,416
Come on, hurry, I'm a busy girl.

386
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
My time isn't free you know.

387
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,416
Ow!

388
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,875
No, no
need to be rough, right?

389
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,875
Can you help her, Karen?

390
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,291
Not Karen. "Kim."

391
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,708
So that's what they
mean by alabaster skin, huh?

392
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,125
What are you
talking abou--

393
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,583
[KIM] No big deal.
It was a scratch,

394
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,000
and you were probably
just warm from being outside.

395
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,291
That's odd.
I suddenly feel better.

396
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,541
Was I just
imagining things before?

397
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,083
[TSUGUMI] One second, Kim.

398
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,833
Um, how much for the bandage?

399
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,541
Eh, don't worry.
This one's on me.

400
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,458
[TSUGUMI] What?

401
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,000
Of course, if
you want to pay.

402
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,875
No, that's all right!

403
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,541
[JACQUELINE] Kim!

404
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,833
You just did
something, didn't you?

405
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,625
What was it?

406
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,500
Huh?

407
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,708
Just tell me.

408
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,666
Come on, what di--

409
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,916
Your name's
Jacqueline, right?

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,125
You EAT students
think you know everything.

411
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,458
Hold on a second!

412
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,791
[KIM] If you want to
continue this conversation,

413
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,083
then it's going to cost you.

414
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,833
I'll see you
around, straight edge.

415
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:13,791
Wha-?

416
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,000
Are you still wrestling
with yourself about that?

417
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,375
I'm not sure
I should accept it.

418
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,666
I can't decide.

419
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,291
All that Ox guy asked
you to do was not hold

420
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,791
a grudge against Kim.

421
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,958
That's not so bad.

422
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,541
Just think of all
the stuff you can buy.

423
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,416
You think I
should keep it, too?

424
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,750
Well, think about it. If you
don't, all of Ox's hard work

425
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,916
will have been for
nothing won't it?

426
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,291
I guess that's true.
Hey, I know!

427
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,125
Why don't we put the
money towards throwing a party?

428
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,583
That's a great idea!
How about tomorrow?

429
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,916
And I vote we have
it at Deathbucks Café!

430
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,750
You're quite the party
animal all of a sudden!

431
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,250
You haven't
seen anything yet!

432
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,416
Is this a private
party for the two of you?

433
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,166
--Hmm?
--Uh?

434
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,625
I guess it's
not enough that you

435
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,375
get to be paired up all the
time. You need a party, too.

436
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,458
I feel really
bad about what

437
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,083
happened in class today.
I'm so sorry!

438
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,000
Hey, that's it!

439
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,208
[MEME] I'll write a
note about it on my arm

440
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,500
to make sure
I remember. There!

441
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,375
Now not even a
scatterbrain like me can forget.

442
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,416
Look!
I have one, too.

443
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,750
[giggling]

444
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,708
This note is weird.
Next time is you for what?

445
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,583
Are you kidding me?

446
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,750
[yawns]

447
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,166
[MEME] Things can get
turbulent here at the DWMA.

448
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,416
Everyone has their own
fears and insecurities.

449
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,083
Tsugumi, what's bothering you?

450
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,375
If you're feeling stressed,
maybe exercise will help.

451
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,708
[ANYA] These are our gym shorts?

452
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,833
[TSUGUMI] Wow, Anya. You
really do have nice legs.

453
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,791
[MEME] I wonder
what's wrong with Tsugumi.
