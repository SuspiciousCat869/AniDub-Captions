The first step is taking
control of the more malleable

At my suggestion,

they'll willingly
attack the other students,

poison to infect them.

the invasion, scattering

result will be a domino effect,

00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,833
That's ridiculous! Whoever heard
of one weapon with two meisters?

159
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,916
It just doesn't
make sense at all!

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,500
Are you turning me down?

161
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,416
Huh? Well, no,
I'm not turning you down.

162
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,125
I'm just saying it's weird.

163
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,666
[TSUGUMI] Something good
came out of this whole mess.

164
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,500
I felt my soul resonating
with each of yours,

165
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:50,416
and you know what? I think
there's more we can do.

166
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,125
I'll bet we can
all resonate together!

167
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,416
Somewhere down the line,
we'll probably have to split up.

168
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,708
I understand that. But that day
isn't today. For now, what I

169
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:06,333
think, is that we're strongest
like this, all together!

170
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,958
We need to report
back to the teachers

171
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,333
with what we learned
about the drug and the witch.

172
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,541
That sounds good to me.

173
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,083
Given what she's
done inside my head,

174
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,125
I think I could be
helpful in locating Shaula.

175
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,541
[MEME]
She was spying through me,

176
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,375
so why couldn't I follow
her voice back to the source?

177
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,500
Like tracing a call!

178
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,291
[ANYA] Let's hurry
back to the academy!

179
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,458
Wow!

180
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,958
[ANYA]
Come on, let's go!

181
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,041
[TSUGUMI]
You guys are kinda heavy.

182
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,750
It's Meme's chest.

183
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,875
[TSUGUMI] I hope
all our friends are okay.

184
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,500
[MEME]
Is the dorm safe?

185
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,875
[ANYA] If there is
an attack on the dorm,

186
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,541
Kim and Jackie are
there to defend it, at least.

187
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,208
[TSUGUMI] I arranged
for some backup, too,

188
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,333
just in case they needed it.

189
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,958
What kind of backup?

190
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,666
[JACQUELINE]
Be careful, Kim!

191
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,583
The housemistress
isn't herself!

192
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,625
Yeah,
I kinda noticed that.

193
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,458
Hey, stop!
What're you doing?

194
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,500
Patty! Go!

195
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,916
[PATTY]
You betcha!

196
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,041
These academy students
aren't all that impressive.

197
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,416
Hey guys!
I'm glad you're here!

198
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,500
[TSUGUMI]
Well? Any luck yet?

199
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,958
I can feel her.

200
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,208
I don't think so!

201
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,166
She's spotted us!

202
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,458
Huh?

203
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,208
She's coming now!
Tsugumi, please move faster!

204
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,416
[TSUGUMI]
Uh, sure!

205
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,541
You brats!

206
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,875
Unbelievable, a girl
like you was able to

207
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,458
break my mind control.
I did not expect that.

208
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,250
I hate to break it to you
witch, but obviously you aren't

209
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,500
as omnipotent as
you think you are.

210
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,875
Come back to me, Meme.
If you do that,

211
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,333
I'll take pity on your
friends and spare their lives.

212
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,708
[SHAULA]
Do you remember how it felt?

213
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,500
The two of us
killed Sid together.

214
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,000
It's hard to forget,
isn't it?

215
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,250
Don't listen to her!

216
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,166
Yes, of course.
I remember that.

217
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,916
The good times and the bad.
I want to remember them all.

218
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,541
Whatever happens,
I don't want to forget

219
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,750
anything important again!

220
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,708
Alright. Let's do this!

221
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,666
Ready!

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,666
[TSUGUMI]
I can picture it.

223
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,708
The sharp blade that's lying
dormant within my soul.

224
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,625
I need you.
Please, awaken!

225
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,083
[TSUGUMI] There are people
who I need to protect!

226
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,958
[ALL] Let's go!
Soul Resonance!

227
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,166
I have a blade! Alright!

228
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,708
Here goes!
Royal Spear Technique!

229
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,458
You brats irritate me.

230
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,958
[TSUGUMI] Oh, no!
Are you okay?

231
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,625
We're fine.
Don't worry.

232
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,333
Let's go, Tsugumi!
Are you ready?

233
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,625
Ready!

234
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,791
[ALL] Shaula!

235
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,458
[TSUGUMI]
Hop on!

236
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,458
Let's end this once and for all!
Spring Bird Attack!

237
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,125
[ANYA]
Is that Shaula?

238
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,375
[TSUGUMI] So,
does that mean, did we win?

239
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,000
That move you two did.

240
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,458
I mean that one that defeated
her, the Spring Bird Attack.

241
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,083
Oh, we sort of
made it up. 

242
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,375
You like it?

243
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,416
Uh. Maybe next time
you can ask before

244
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,916
picking out a name.

245
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,541
[CLAY] It's calm
all of a sudden.

246
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,208
I don't know how, but
it seems like it's all over.

247
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,250
[NAIGUS] The witch's
readings have vanished,

248
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,375
as has the noise that
was blanketing the city.

249
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,833
Looks like I won't
need to perform any

250
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,166
student autopsies after all.
Well. I'll be going, then.

251
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,250
There are a fair
number of injuries.

252
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,166
I hate to ask, but...

253
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,916
Why do I get the feeling
that you don't hate to ask?

254
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,833
[STEIN] No matter
what you say, though,

255
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,708
I am not becoming a teacher.

256
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,041
[TSUGUMI]
Akane! Clay!

257
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,708
[CLAY]
Harudori! Tatane?

258
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,416
So you three made
it through all right.

259
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,416
We did, more or less.

260
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,708
What do you have there?

261
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,625
[TSUGUMI] It happened
when we beat Shaula.

262
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,875
[AKANE AND CLAY]
What? Seriously?

263
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,041
[ANYA] No need to
look so surprised.

264
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,083
We are DWMA students,
after all.

265
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,541
Even if we're
in the NOT class!

266
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,416
Well, it looks like I owe
you an apology, Princess Anya.

267
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,958
Princess Anya?

268
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,791
Hey, Maka, let's get going.

269
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,125
Yeah.

270
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,166
[AKANE]
Very good work.

271
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,500
Here ya' go.

272
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,541
I don't know, it seems
like there's something

273
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,791
different about you.

274
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,541
That's because I've
finally decided on a partner.

275
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,583
Yes! It's me!

276
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,916
[TSUGUMI] Despite all
the chaos and confusion

277
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,750
we'd been through, we
knew it was time to put

278
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,250
the pieces back
together. Soon enough,

279
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,791
winter came
to Death City.

280
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,541
[TSUGUMI] The older students
carried on as usual,

281
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,125
which wasn't surprising.

282
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,583
[TSUGUMI] Anya returned to her
country and her family's castle

283
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,666
to give a report
of the incident.

284
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,000
And I'll bet it
wasn't easy to explain.

285
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,666
I'm sure glad
I'm not a princess.

286
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,875
[TSUGUMI] Meme was admitted to
the hospital under Dr. Stein's

287
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,208
care, just to make sure
the magic is entirely gone.

288
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,916
It sounds like it might
take a little while, though.

289
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,208
[TSUGUMI] I do get
kind of lonely without my

290
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,541
partners around, but I'll
manage until they make it back.

291
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,833
I've got my own
work to do, after all.

292
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,458
I can't very well
spend my whole life being

293
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,416
a teenager who's
in love with love.

294
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,291
[LIZ]
Hey! Tsugumi!

295
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,291
[TSUGUMI]
Liz and Patty! Hey!

296
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,708
Heya!

297
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,416
I see you found
yourselves a partner.

298
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,333
Yeah, that guy nags
worse than an old woman.

299
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,958
[KID]
Come on, Liz!

300
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,375
I've told you!
Stay symmetrical!

301
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,833
When we're standing still,
I should be in the middle of

302
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,666
you two! Like this!
Symmetry is essential.

303
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,833
Bye.

304
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,375
[KID] How many times
to I have to say it?

305
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:33,208
[KID] Honestly!
I wish you would listen to me!

306
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,916
[KID] All together now!
We love...

307
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,458
[MEME]
Tsugumi!

308
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,708
[TSUGUMI] Meme!
You're finally back!

309
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,958
You doing all right?

310
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,833
Yes! You grew your hair out,
didn't you?

311
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,291
My hair and your chest: there's
no stopping either of them

312
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,958
from growing! I'll happily
trade you any time you want!

313
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,041
[ANYA]
Stop making out already!

314
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,791
[TSUGUMI AND MEME]
Anya!

315
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,750
How long has it been?
Haven't you grown up at all?

316
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,583
Nope! Come on, Princess.
Are you ready?

317
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,291
Hey! Quit it with that
"Princess" business, okay?

318
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,083
Well, Princess,
let's go!

319
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,208
[ANYA] Oh, please!
Not you, too, Meme!

320
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,583
[TSUGUMI] It's like
you're calling a dog!

321
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,458
[MEME] I really like
the uniform you chose, Anya.

322
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,166
[TSUGUMI] Mm-hmm,
such pretty legs!

323
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,375
[ANYA] Yeah, well.
I'd rather have my legs

324
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,333
than your chest, Tsugumi!

325
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,458
[TSUGUMI]
Gagantous!
