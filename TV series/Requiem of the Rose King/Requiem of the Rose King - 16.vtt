00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.306
Greetings, m'lord.

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:18.436
Oh, hello. I'm waiting
for my mother.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.022
She's taking me to the woods
since it's such a fine day.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:25.693
[CECILY] Yes. So let's be off.
We've a ways to go.

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:30.072
The woods are dark.
I may get lost.

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:32.908
If I do, I hope that
you'll come find me.

00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:35.578
Will you, Catesby?

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:38.330
[HASTINGS]
Catesby. I'll go on alone.

Fresh strawberry pies!

Surprise your loved ones with
something as sweet as them!

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.848
[CATESBY]
I've no reason to call on him.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:58.434
[JANE] If Richard shall not
speak out against His Majesty's

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:02.354
whims, your only choice is to
rely on the queen dowager.

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:03.856
[HASTINGS]
But that would entail...

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.316
[JANE]
Come, Hastings.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.527
Asking for a bit of
advice is not treason.

00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.279
[CATESBY]
Don't tell me.

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:18.245
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.207
These royal houses with
their flowered crests

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.959
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:28.172
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.716
the "Wars of the Roses."

♪

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:05.227
[BUCKINGHAM]
The next council will decide

00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:07.271
if you take the throne
at the coronation.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.773
Everything hinges on that play.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.275
[RICHARD]
And exactly how many allies

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.110
do you imagine
will side with us?

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.280
By my reckoning, it'll be
a fairly even split.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.867
While the Earl of Northumberland
and Lord Howard are ours,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.412
I can see Hastings and
Stanley being persuaded.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:25.414
What about the Bishop of Ely?

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.917
John Morton is the type of
man who can be bought.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.085
That's true.
I'll speak to him, then.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.422
I suppose I should meet with
Howard and the others as well.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.675
But what if Stanley and
Hastings won't join us?

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.345
When impassioned words slip
from those blessed fevered lips

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:42.556
of yours, there isn't a soul
alive who would refuse you.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.350
If my "fevered lips" fail?

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:46.852
[BUCKINGHAM]
We'll need to kill them.

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:48.228
Because if we do not,

00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:50.648
the next heads on the
chopping block will be ours.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.024
Those are the rules to play by

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.360
when embarking on a
gamble against God.

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:57.196
[RICHARD] But what will
become of Hastings' retainer?

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.365
Should things go south.

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:00.366
Which one?

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.825
Catesby, of course.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.204
The man's devotion
knows no bounds.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.289
He's still human, though.

00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:10.709
Will he look at me
with hate in his eyes?

00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:12.753
[BUCKINGHAM] If he truly
cares for the royal family,

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.965
he'll understand. However...

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:18.550
If he becomes a briar
in our path to glory,

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:21.512
I'll brandish my sword
and cut him from it.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.727
Look, Mother!
He finally made it!

00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:32.356
[ELIZABETH] Did he?
I grew tired of waiting.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.234
[ELIZABETH]
What a dolt that Hastings is!

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.027
[gasps]

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.196
[ELIZABETH]
Thank you for visiting, my lord.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.365
It's much appreciated.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.909
Um, it is my pleasure,
your Grace.

00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:45.786
[ELIZABETH] I'm sorry, but I
don't intend to meddle

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.621
in politics anymore.

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:51.750
All I want... is to live a
peaceful life with my family.

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.460
If you remain in this convent,

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:55.671
I guarantee your
safety and that life.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.966
But uh, I wish to ask
for some advice.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:03.595
Oh? A revered noble wants
guidance from the likes of me?

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:06.015
To earnestly seek knowledge
from an old enemy

00:05:06.098 --> 00:05:09.643
demonstrates how
virtuous your spirit is.

00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.228
How dignified.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.022
The realm would be
in excellent hands

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.857
if you were named Protector!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.859
What? No, not I!

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.153
[ELIZABETH] Why not?
I would feel most at ease

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.905
entrusting my
Edward to your care.

00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:27.911
[CATESBY] Should I report this
development to Lord Richard?

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.414
But if the Duke of Buckingham
were to learn of it as well...

Pray tell where you're headed.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.921
An abbey's a rather
inappropriate place

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.758
for interludes with a lover,
or so I would think.

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.342
But this setting
would certainly suit

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:44.219
a meeting with the
queen dowager.

00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:45.512
Worry not!

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:47.431
I can attest she's undergone
a change of heart.

You needn't fear her anymore.

[CATESBY] Lord Buckingham!
With all due respect,

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:52.770
there is something I'd
like to make known.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.022
Every last action that
Lord Hastings takes

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.774
is done on behalf
of the royal family.

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.817
Make no mistake.

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.278
Should it become apparent
that I speak falsely,

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.280
I would ask you to punish me.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.865
I see.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:08.368
In that case, I wish to speak
with you in your master's stead.

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:11.038
Shall we?

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.916
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why did you shield Hastings?

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:18.754
Is it your desire to remain
an honest man until death?

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:22.174
Who is it you truly serve?

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.717
The one I serve, truly--

00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:25.135
[BUCKINGHAM] Do you believe
you understand him

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.805
better than anyone else?

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:31.517
Kind gestures and compassion are
not what he presently seeks.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.186
And since you can't
become a demon,

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.147
you're incapable of saving
Richard at this point.

[BUCKINGHAM] You met with
the Bishop of Ely, yes?

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.286
Were you able to buy him off?

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.790
Wait. Where'd this
mark come from?

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.874
It appears that the bishop

00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.919
has acquired a taste
for corruption.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.964
He wished not for gold,
but for my body.

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:06.093
[gasps] The bastard!
He defiled you!

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.928
I shall dig out his
damned intestines

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.471
and tear him to pieces!

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:11.598
[RICHARD] What is there
to be upset about?

00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:15.769
It's not the most moral act,
but it won us the bishop.

00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:19.106
Why does this anger
you so? Tell me.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.816
Because of our oath.

00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:24.945
I assure you
I haven't broken it.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:28.198
I will not open this body
to anyone other than you.

You saved me earlier, Catesby.

Thank you!

Never have I known a man
with more integrity than you.

Who is it you truly serve?

You're incapable of saving

[BUCKINGHAM] Let him in
if you wish. I don't mind.

It's in regard

[RICHARD] Catesby. If you mean
to turn your blade on me...

More and more often now,
he goes to Westminster,

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.591
so that he can meet the
queen dowager in secret.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.843
And with each passing
encounter that they have,

00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:31.929
their bond only grows.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.388
What of you, Catesby?

00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:36.308
What do you intend to
do about your master?

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:41.563
[CATESBY] If he shows
signs of treachery,

00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:44.233
right then, I'll dispatch him.

00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:46.068
You would dispatch
someone who stays loyal

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.736
to the House of York?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.529
While I, on the other hand,

All in order to

From the moment that
you were born,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.958
I have only served one lord.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.002
It was you then,
and it is you now.

[RICHARD] I am a demon.
I'll pull you to hell.

You'll look on in pain,
amazed why you fell.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.185
[BUCKINGHAM] From now on, see to
it that you take my orders

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:21.436
as though they are Richard's,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.313
for we are two
halves of one whole.

Of course. It shall be done.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.318
[BUCKINGHAM] Excellent news,
since I've already thought

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.654
of your first task.

Find that traitor and
lop his head off.

00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:37.077
Consider his blood the seal
of your compact with us.

00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:45.127

This warmth sears my flesh.

Though both noblemen are

Will their support extend all
the way to you being king?

pledge it and forge a pact.

00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:12.404
[ELY]
I-I would speak to you.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.240
If you would speak,
then I shall hear you speak.

00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:17.492
Apologies, but it's
a private matter.

00:10:17.576 --> 00:10:19.328
That's fine. You may proceed.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:24.166
[ELY gasps] You see, in honor of
the widowed queen and her son,

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.667
King Edward the Fifth,

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.170
a religious service
is being arranged.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.671
You're certain, Ely?

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.173
We have heard nothing of this.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.800
Because it is to be
undisclosed to you.

00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:36.219
'Twas formally signed
by the archbishop,

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:37.971
but I know in order
to request it of him,

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:40.640
the queen dowager worked
through Lord Hastings.

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.352
Uh, f-for now,
I'll take my leave.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.438
Please visit to sample my
strawberries whenever you wish,

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.440
Lord Richard.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.650
If we needed more proof
to dispose of Hastings,

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.027
I guess we have it.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.655
But still, I did not foresee
Elizabeth being so bold.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.991
This will be no average
church service.

00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.993
Merely having it take
place will demonstrate

00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:03.080
that the queen dowager
still wields great power.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.790
And we can't even
try to prevent it,

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.708
or else we'd suffer
a fatal backlash

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:09.211
as enemies of the clergy
and the poor widow.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.880
Here's a declaration of war.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:15.634
This is God...
against the devil.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.220
The devil has the devil's way.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.807
I thought it wrong to
wish for warmth so grand,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.977
but now it's here,
in the palm of my hand.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:30.315
I shall take what I want,
and make my stand.

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.152
[ELIZABETH]
Lord Hastings.

00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:37.531
Has the date of the service
been determined yet?

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.867
[HASTINGS] Actually, the service
has been canceled entirely.

00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:42.369
[ELIZABETH gasps]

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.329
[HASTINGS] And not only that,
in its place there will be

00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:47.124
a service for the
Duke of Gloucester.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.168
[ELIZABETH] Impossible!
Who would give such a command?

00:11:50.252 --> 00:11:51.711
It was decreed by the king.

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.881
[gasps] Richard must've
somehow found out

00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:57.968
and goaded His Majesty!
Fie on that demon!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.054
Frankly, given the position
that he holds now,

00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:03.306
he might issue orders
without the king's command

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.808
or his knowledge.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:07.227
Additionally, though it
pains me much

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.937
to be the one to inform you,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.731
the king further demanded his
younger brother be handed over

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.984
to the Duke of Gloucester.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.026
Queen Elizabeth.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.197
[ELIZABETH laughs]

00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:21.199
That foul creature
gives no quarter!

00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:22.951
Well played, demon!

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.578
Does he intend to wrench
all hope from me

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.538
so that I plunge into despair?

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.498
But one who devotes
her life to revenge

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.208
does not fear such things.

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:33.879
The more he takes, the hotter
and brighter my soul burns!

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.547
Just you watch, Richard.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.509
In due time, your hopes will
be the ones dashed... by me.

00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:41.595
Mother, are you all right?

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:45.223
[ELIZABETH] Of course.
Why did I not realize it sooner?

00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:47.809
There's a person who
knows Richard completely,

00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:50.145
and despises him
more than anyone!

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.064
[HASTINGS]
Your Grace, Gloucester's actions

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.317
clearly overstep his
authority as Protector!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.986
To carry out the service
for his sake in your palace!

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.072
He has been a bit high
handed lately, hasn't he?

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.200
Surely Ely agrees, don't you?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.702
[ELY gasps]
Yes, you're entirely correct.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:06.912
You've seen it, too?

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.748
His impudence and his
tyrannical behavior!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.250
[HOWARD]
Desist immediately!

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:13.668
[HASTINGS]
Lord Howard.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:16.213
'Tis cowardly to speak
thus in his absence!

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.882
The proceedings in which
The King delegated his power

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.218
to the Duke of Gloucester
were legitimate.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.011
The impudent one is you!

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:26.348
Sophistry! Anyone with eyes can
see who's in the right here!

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:27.724
And it's the
intentioned mother--

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:31.686
[EDWARD V] Hastings!
Gathering for Mass is tiresome.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.730
--But Your Majesty--!
--[EDWARD V] Leave us.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:40.946
[YORKIST NOBLES chatter]

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.198
[HASTINGS]
I realized too late.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:47.118
The palace is already full of
apples rotten to the core.

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:50.038
The few of us left must
strategize discreetly.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.499
And I know just the place!

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.835
Blessings of the Lord be upon
you, guardians of the truth.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:00.131
Our Bishop of Ely, Lord Stanley,
dear Lord Hastings.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:02.217
We must band together
and take England back

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.219
from that lawless
fiend, Richard,

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.721
lest the royal family
be destroyed!

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:10.433
I know. Our situation has
grown more dire than before.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.227
Formerly, Richard was
a straightforward,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.353
reserved soldier.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.021
He has a strange power,

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.940
one that allows him
to entice folks.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.900
It's a-almost like magic!

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:20.360
I think I know of this spell,

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.946
it's the very potent power
of wealth and authority.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.448
Quite right!
That's precisely it!

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.783
[ELIZABETH]
Everyone has weaknesses

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:30.161
they don't wish to be known.
If only we knew his.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:31.913
Some scandal, for instance,

00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:33.832
that would shake
people's faith in him.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:37.210
[CECILY] I take it that's
why you called, Elizabeth?

00:14:37.294 --> 00:14:39.337
What else could the reason be?

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:40.880
[ELIZABETH]
Mother!

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.550
I pray you'll forgive my abrupt
summons and previous rudeness.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.844
There is a task God
has called us to do.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.096
[CECILY] I have bewept a
worthy husband's death

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.181
and lived with looking
on his images,

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.434
but now two mirrors of
his princely semblance

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.437
are cracked in pieces
by malignant death.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.439
All of the evil that
has befallen our family

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.107
was born from this womb.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.110
A false glass that
only shows my shame.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:06.489
Thus in exchange for helping
you, I have but one request.

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.327
I want you to ensure
that Richard dies.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.454
[ALL gasp]

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.706
[CECILY]
I've tried many times myself,

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.207
but never went through with it.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.628
Ahh, if only I could have
slain him with my words!

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:21.880
I would have shouted Richard's
secret to all of England

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.799
and let the world punish
him before it came to this!

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.343
[ELIZABETH]
What secret?

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.261
[CECILY] I concealed it from the
public because it could have

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:31.598
very well led to the downfall
of our house had it gotten out.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:35.268
And in consequence, my cowardice
has allowed that demon

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:39.356
to sharpen its claws,
spread its wings, and flourish!

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.776
But now, I have no more
left that I can lose.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.154
Nothing except for my
beloved Edward's children.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.616
Yes, precisely! For the sake of
your son's darling children.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:53.203
Tell us all the truth!
Tell us Richard's secret!

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:56.122
The truth is that Richard
Glouscester is demonic.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.333
[inaudible]

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.630
[MAN A] He's an undigested
and deformed lump!

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.675
A blood-soaked demon who
defied the will of God!

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:08.218
This I prophesy!

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.638
One day, a host of grieving
widows, of childless parents,

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.015
of orphans whose futures
have been snuffed,

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.934
they will lament the
needless deaths he caused!

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.102
[YORKIST MAN A]
What did he say?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.353
[YORKIST WOMAN B]
Lord Richard is a demon?

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.021
This should be enough to
let us strike Gloucester

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.773
with a most fatal blow.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:25.902
Though I personally find these
claims quite hard to believe.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.278
I don't.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.864
Looking back on it, Richard's
peculiar way of acting

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.909
make sense with what
Lady Cecily says.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.662
We shall indict him at
the next council meeting.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:39.958
And expose his true demonic
nature to the light of day!

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.584
[MAN B]
Why was he ever born?

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.712
Curse the day of that
monster's birth!

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.171
Curse it to hell!

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:48.717
[MAN B] Curse the demon!
The demon, Richard Plantagenet!

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.350
Such a dreadful racket.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.061
I guess Hastings would like to
see you burned at the stake

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:01.563
come next council.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.606
Is that your idea
of informing, witch?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.776
You realize it's much too
late to beg for your life.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.737
I've known the duke's
secret a while now

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.197
and have yet to
tell a single soul.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.866
The thing I don't know, however.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:15.368
Do you truly
understand yourself?

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:17.287
Have you felt at all unusual?

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.247
If it's medicine
you require, Grace,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.541
don't hesitate to
ask for anything.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.127
The kind that sapped
the king of his will?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.795
An abortifacient.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:31.259
Do be careful. It causes
inflammation in the sunlight.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.014
The council will have
something displayed,

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:39.684
but t'won't be a demon.
T'will be his head.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.274
[STANLEY] Where is the
rest of the council?

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:47.484
[BUCKINGHAM]
Oh.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.445
I suppose we must have
arrived a little early.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:54.199
Even the Duke of Gloucester
isn't here yet.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.533
Can't you stand in?

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.119
I believe you could serve
as a proxy for him.

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:01.331
After all, you should
soonest know his mind.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.707
We're friends, yes.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.168
We know each other's faces,
but for our hearts,

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.086
he knows no more of mine

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.090
than I of yours, or I of his,
my lord, than you of mine.

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.887
[RICHARD]
Pardon my tardiness, my lords.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.893
Now. What shall we discuss?

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.062
The coronation.
We need a date.

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.939
[RICHARD]
By the way, My Lord of Ely.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.483
Was that not an intimate time
we spent in your chambers

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.735
the other day? Just us two.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.153
[gasps]

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.280
You promised to gift me
strawberries from your garden

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:36.533
and I saw plenty of good
ones growing there.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.910
I do beseech you,
send for some of them.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.495
[gasps]
Right now?

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:41.788
Yes, now. Go.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.499
[ELY]
M-Marry and will.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.835
So what date shall we set?

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.629
I think the others
are much too late.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:52.549
Forgive me, Gloucester.
Will you excuse me, too?

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.717
I would like to step
out for a moment.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.177
Go ahead.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:04.435
Lord Hastings. The others
shall not be coming here.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.188
They are presently gathered
at another meeting place.

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.439
Damn it!

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.650
So Gloucester did manage
to buy all of them off!

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.151
Catesby!

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.696
Bring nobles, post haste!
They can observe the charges!

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.781
Gather as many
witnesses as you can!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:20.159
Then you're in luck.
They're already here.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.954
Incredible.
Your talents never cease.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.665
I dare say you're the
most capable man alive!

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.542
I'm certain your
feelings are mixed.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:32.380
Taking out Gloucester, both a
former master and friend.

00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:36.426
I feel fine. I had one
wish for Lord Richard.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:40.096
I prayed he'd be able to
walk in the warmth of light.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.308
It should be you.
Perform your lord's last rites.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.102
End his misery.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.229
[door slams]

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:49.939
Hear me, Gloucester!

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.817
For I shall tell you the true
purpose of this council!

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.360
Listen well!

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.864
Richard Plantagenet schemes
to overthrow our great kingdom!

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.742
She could've kept it secret
for her honor's sake, but--!

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:04.370
Lady Cecily revealed the truth
for the future of England!

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.415
In his flesh, the duke harbors
a demon from the depths of hell!

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:12.712
[YORKIST SOLDIERS chatter]

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:15.673
Show us all! Show us proof
contrary to this claim

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:19.052
and verify your
innocence before us!

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:23.973
So a cursed demon, am I?
And who was it that cursed me?

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:25.558
[ELY, HASTINGS gasp]

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.311
My body changed.
Through some despicable magic,

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.522
my form warped into the
ghastly thing it is now.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.608
So who is the actual fiend here?

00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:35.902
Is it not the one
who cast this curse?

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.362
Well, Hastings?

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.238
You and all who threw
in their lot in with you

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:41.366
are the true demons
infesting this court!

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.701
[grunts]
You speak utter lies!

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.912
[RICHARD]
Then behold.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.289
[YORKIST SOLDIERS gasp]

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:51.250
Here's your proof that I
was not born this way.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.173
It's the result of a curse
you had your witch cast.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:59.175
Put these rebels to death!

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:02.887
[HASTINGS]
Now I'm certain of everything,

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.555
even without a
shred of evidence!

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:07.058
You are all godless fools
seeking the empty favor

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:08.601
of a demon!

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.521
Catesby! Seize Richard
this instant!

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.694
[CATESBY] That day, he needed
me, but I could not save him.

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.405
[CATESBY]
Lord Richard! Lord Richard!

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:23.282
[CATESBY] Oh, no.
What if Lord Richard is..?

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:24.826
[CATESBY]
Your Grace.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.078
I know full well I can
never become the light

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.330
that illumines your path.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:30.832
Even so...

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:37.005
To me, you are life itself.
I won't abandon you.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.382
Lord Hastings. Ready yourself.

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:43.177
Even you side
with Richard? Disgusting!

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.679
I'll have this crown of mine

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:47.765
cut from my shoulders before
I see it so foul misplaced.

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:52.437
[CATESBY] I will never
abandon you, my lord.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.357
In the pitch-black darkness,
I will be your sword.
