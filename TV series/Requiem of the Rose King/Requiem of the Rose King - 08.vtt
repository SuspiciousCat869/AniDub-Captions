00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD, HENRY gasp]

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
Wait, Henry?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
Hello, Richard.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN NOBLE K]
Where is he?

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN NOBLE L]
Find him!

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Come on!

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] I can hardly
believe you're here!

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I was just
about to say the same.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Hold on. You're hurt!

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
No, I'm...

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This blood is not my own.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Richard!

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
What's going on?

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Explanations can wait. Let's go.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET]
Edward.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
Unless I've mistaken you for
another Lancastrian prince,

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
you took the hand of
the lady to your right,

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
firmly vowing to make her
your wife, did you not?

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
No mistake, Mother.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
I was happy to make
lady Anne my wife.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Were you? If so, then why
haven't you consummated

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
your marriage as of yet?

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, uh--

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
There are many different
ways to rouse the spirit,

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
so there's really no excuse.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
Um. Mother, please.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
Listen well.
Consummate it tonight.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
The two of you will
fulfill your duty.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
There is no need for love.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
So, listen. I know everything.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
You had romantic feelings
for Richard, did you not?

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
This is equally hard
for me, you know!

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
I was in love with
another as well.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
If you cannot break with
those feelings you have--

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
I can. Rather I already did.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Was that easy for you?

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
Discarding your
heart like it was

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
an inconvenient piece of trash?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
Truly unbelievable.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
Whatever love you felt
is nothing like my own.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
I swore an oath to
God I'd have her.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
No matter how great
or small the obstacle.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.307 position:50% align:center
I would tear it down and
carve my way. I swore--

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
I deeply loved Lord Richard!

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
Don't presume to know the
contents of my heart when,

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center
in truth, you have no idea
how much I cared for him!

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
I've a fair idea how much
you cared, and it's abysmal!

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
How could you?

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Because!

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
I have my own love for
Richard to compare it to,

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
and it's far greater than yours!

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I'm s-sorry, but God
would never allow such...

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
Such a thing.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
It is your love that
He wouldn't allow.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
Just in case you have
any lingering ties,

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you plain.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
Richard is really a
woman in disguise.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
She adorns men's clothing
and is addressed as a man,

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
but she lives
hiding her true sex.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
Please do not make a fool of me.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] He lies. It's true
Lord Richard is as slender

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
and beautiful as
a woman, but still...

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Somewhere, something is hiding

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
in the depths of his heart.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how much
you care or don't care for her,

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
you were both born as women.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.244 position:50% align:center
Thus, she would never
requite your shallow feelings

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
to begin with.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
Are you unwell? We can rest.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]
Please, Henry.

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
See if you can find any yarrow
leaves lying around here.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
They've a jagged shape,
and are fairly long.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
All right. I'll be back.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] A minor wound
shall not be what ends me.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
Death must wait till
I rejoin with Catesby.

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE A]
Richard. Come to say goodbye?

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
Then hurry and die!

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE A] Vanish in
solitude, deep in the woods.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE B] None will
save you, not that anyone could.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE B]
Demon deaths aren't mourned.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
To hell they descend.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE A] Alone in
the world, sans a single friend.

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICES]
Till the very end!

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE A, CECILY]
Richard!

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE A]
It's punishment time.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE A]
Your life is a crime.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE B]
The day you were born...

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICE B]
They shouted in scorn...

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICES]
"Breathe your last foul breath

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
and embrace your death!"

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Begone, you wretched demon!

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Henry.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
Grant him your protection, Lord.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
If You must take a life, I offer
mine in exchange for his.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
You could see...
all the demons?

00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
You could see them?

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
[HENRY sighs] Wolves are an
incarnation of demons,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
aren't they?

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
Thankfully the Lord
heard my prayers

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
and answered them swiftly.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I thought, I thought
I would never see you again.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I thought I
shouldn't see you again.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
Not a day went by
I didn't miss you.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
I've longed to see you.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad. So truly glad.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Where are you, my lord?

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] This should guard
us from any other beasts.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
I found it earlier.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.692 position:50% align:center
You must be cold.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry. You're so warm.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hm?

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hm?

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It wasn't... a dream.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
You're here. Thank God.
Last night wasn't a dream.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD groans]

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! You're still hurt.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center
I'll go pick some
fresh yarrow for you.

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry!

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
Should I stay?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Why am I so fainthearted?

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
I won't be long.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I... cannot die.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:39.749 position:50% align:center
Not until England is with
House York, once again.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.462 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] But, if I fail
to convince George,

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
I might be killed on the spot.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Please return soon, Henry.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER A]
So, they did flee on horseback.

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER B]
Do you think the king is safe?

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] The king? Henry should
be in the Tower of London.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
What would bring him here?

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
Never mind that,
Lord Richard comes first.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
[HENRY pants]

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
I'm back!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
I'm sure you're parched.

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
I found a spring, but only had
my hands to carry water.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This is fine.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] We can stay here.
We'll leave as soon as I'm well.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Whenever I look up at the sky,

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
I think back to the first
time you and I met.

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed one bit.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
In mine, I have visions of
my mother abandoning me.

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
Do you still have those
same nightmares?

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
Would our dreams change
if the world did?

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
At least my fond memories
of you are also intact.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
Those thoughts are
what cleanse me.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
They have the power to
beautify the whole world.

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Even alone,
it wasn't frightening.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Rather, the loneliness has been
kind ever since losing Father.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
That's why I swore
to never waver again.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
And yet...

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
...you make me so very weak.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Should you be moving?

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
We're likely to starve to death
if I leave everything to you.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
Now where is this spring?

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.328 position:50% align:center
There, I marked a trail
just like you told me.

Thank you for listening.

I'll fetch our water
supply for the day.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
By yourself?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Gather branches
and wait for me here.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
He tied far too many.
It looks like a child's work.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I should not draw
any eyes in this place.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
Should you really be
in the water, Richard?

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps] I'm fine!
Just washing the blood off.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] I'd hate for you
to collapse. Let me help.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Stay away!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Don't take another step,

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
else you'll see
this cursed body.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] Oh, dear.
The blood has hardened.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
That looks much better.
All clean.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
You're truly... flawless.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
[PROSTITUTE A]
Oh. What a surprise.

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
We have company.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
I'll get out first, all right?

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Huh. Haven't seen
either of you around.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Thank Heaven
for this distraction.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
I can avoid his
gaze while I dress.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
You're gorgeous! Are you real?

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
Hope I don't wake
if you're a dream.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
Though I could lose
some sleep with you,

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
since you found our paradise.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
And get this, Mister Handsome.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
I'll give it to you
free of charge.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center

Mother, where are you?

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
I need you.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
[LOVER A] You cruel woman.
Your son is watching, you know.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
[CATHERINE]
It's fine. He's still a child.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
You are the only
one I truly love.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
I'll leave everything
to Henry so we can be

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
like this all the time.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
[LOVER A]
You're not just cruel,

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
you're a lovely,
lascivious demon!

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
[CATHERINE]
Yes. I am a demon.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
A love demon.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
It's almost like a curse.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
My mother's infidelity
and betrayal haunts me.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
Even to this very day.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
That's why you fear women?

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
Because you see them as demons?

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] No. It's not
women that I fear.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
What frightens me is...

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
...desire.

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
To love, to lust is a sin,

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Why am I... in pain?

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
so I will love no one.

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Why does it hurt?

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
I don't need anyone to love,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
if I have a friend I can
trust with all my heart.

I am no woman, and yet...

You're my very
own angel, Richard.
