00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
I imagine a
"high-class courtesan"

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
should sport
somewhat finer attire.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Every man knows the surest way

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
to a woman's heart...
is with gifts!

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
What I have now should do it.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
You can't be too careful.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
What do you think of this?
Wouldn't it suit you nicely?

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
[MERCHANT A]
Care to try it on, madame?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
--No.
--Try it, I insist!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
Swordplay would be
quite a challenge.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
You look positively stunning!

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
This moment should
be made a portrait!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
How do you like it?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
All I need is some cloth
to conceal my face.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you
allow me to buy it?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
With elegant clothing, you would
look far more feminine!

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
That's precisely why I refused.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
So do I... look like
a woman to you?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course you do.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
What a perplexing maid.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
I knew winning her
wouldn't be so simple,

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
but that's part of her charm.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
It's quite crowded.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
Take care not to
lose sight of me.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Well then.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
I will be bold and
take my chance!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
It's difficult to walk. Let go.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
These berry pies smell divine,
would you like one?

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.310 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
Shopkeeper, we need
two pies! Quick!

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
Buy one more for me, please.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] For you,
I'd buy every pie in the land!

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Is it good? Would you
like mine, too?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to even try it?

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
I only bought these because
I could tell you wanted them.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
Was there nothing at the
market that you wanted?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] There's but
one thing I truly desire.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
And that is a crown.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
Well that's a laughable desire.
Only the king can have a crown.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
Obviously I comprehend, but I--

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The mere wish is a sin.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
Once we save the king,

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll be eager to thank
you with a circlet of gold.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
Now, wait!

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
Have you never wished
for something?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
Never wanted something
so desperately,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
that you would
commit a sin to get it?

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Even if I sin, I won't ever win.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER B] I'm tired
of being worked like a dog.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER C]
We're shorthanded.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
How can we not be with the
amount of fighting going on?

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
Sell it as I said.
Don't fail me.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
Have no fear. I'll preserve your
virtue at all costs, m'lady.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] A job well done,
indeed, my good men.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt my sudden
appearance has you both

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
highly suspicious, but I
do come with a purpose.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
I've brought Edward some
healthy prey to hunt.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER B]
The lucky devil.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
Now, if you would
please make way...

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Edward.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER C]
Excuse me.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
But The door will have to
remain open, just in case.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
So, we're to be watched.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
Who goes? An assassin, perhaps?

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
Come to end me once and for all?

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No, I'd never.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]
Wait, Ri--

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll forgive
my rudeness.

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
You see, I only wish to soothe
your woes with all my heart,

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
Lord Edward.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]
Well, aren't you just charming?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
Then have you any proof
of these intentions?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] Ah-ha. You've come
to me most prepared.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
My, what a rare opportunity.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
Guards. What say you men
to shutting that door

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
and joining us in our pleasure?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Why? Why do none come?

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
My Lord!

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
There are signs of discord
in nearly every region!

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
Lords report they are
pressed to respond

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
and cannot leave their lands!

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT C]
A request for aid, my lord!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT D]
Before that, this petition!

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] I'm king!
They should be reporting to me!

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
The lack of a king is the
root of all this strife.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
It will take legitimate
royal authority to subdue.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Then hurry and use
your authority to make me king!

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] I know you're
eager to claim the throne,

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
but a parliament must
be held to crown you.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Unless Edward was
to die, that is.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
If we circle around
from this side,

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
the guard should
be relatively lighter.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
Catesby is waiting with horses
right outside the castle,

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
so let's hurry.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
Um. These walls are quite high.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Take off your cloak,
else you'll drown.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll give Catesby
the signal after you jump.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
Almost there, Your Grace.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
Thank you, brother.
Trust you'll stay close.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Please make haste.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
A patrol's on the way.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Wait!

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Will you come along?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I see. Then it
is here we must part.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
Try not to get yourself hanged.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
B-Before you go...

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.465 position:50% align:center
...take this.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
I bought it at the market.
Care for it as you would me.

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
We'll meet again.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
I'll see to it that we do.

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
And when I finally come for you,
I swear I shall be a king.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Your Majesty,
time and place demand speed.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Before we are found,
we must set sail.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
How could they have
caught up so soon.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD grunts]

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty,
King Edward the fourth.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
I am Lord Buckingham.
I am here to escort you.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
Your swiftness is
most impressive.

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Such loyalty will be remembered
and, in due time, rewarded.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
Please, Sire, relax at
your leisure this evening.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
I've also readied some women,
should you desire their company.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
How very thoughtful of you.

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
Presently, though,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
there's something I
desire more than women.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
I would dress if you
would take your leave.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
What a shame,
those clothes suit you.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
How'd word of our great escape
manage to reach your ears?

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
I was looking for you.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
Finding you with Edward in tow
was an unexpected bonus.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
A stroke of luck.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
Should it become a
war to avenge him,

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
your legitimacy will be
bolstered by this act.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to say?

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] The chance
hasn't passed you by.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Remove one of the thorns

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
in your throne
while you still can.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
If anyone questions your story,

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
just say he was already dead
when you arrived to rescue him.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
Do not mistake me.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
That which I'm seeking is
safety for the House of York.

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
I only crave one thing now,

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
and it is not the
warmth of a woman.

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
I want Warwick,
the man who mocked me.

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
For only his blood will suffice.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
I shall not feel joy,
not a single shred,

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
until my hands hold
his traitorous head.

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
How could he have escaped?

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER D] It seems
someone infiltrated the castle

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
and abducted him.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
He has any number of partisans.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
We haven't located
Richard yet, either.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
If our foes learn of
Edward's rescue,

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
it will increase their morale.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
So spread rumors that we
ourselves released him.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
There is no cause for alarm!

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter how many
men he adds to his army,

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
Edward could never defeat
us the way we are now!

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
Because I am the king!

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
We have the power of
the people on our side!

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Not quite.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
Our supporters have been halved
due to the lack of a sovereign.

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
Circumstances are as
uncertain as a tossing ship.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER E]
Halt!

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
I promise there's no need to
raise weapons against me.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
I'm his honored guest, am I not?

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
Who is this?

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
Did he just call himself king?
I couldn't hear all that well.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
So why don't you tell me?

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty, are you fully
prepared to kill your brother?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Kill?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
We should simply capture him
the same way we did before.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] As I thought,
I cannot win with George.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Which leaves me with no choice.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
Warwick, who is the king?

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
My prince, I know what I said.

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
And as promised, I shall
offer you my daughter.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
He's your prince?
And you offered him who?

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
What is the meaning of this?
Tell me, Warwick!

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET chuckles]

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] I'm so very
grateful for this reunion, 

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
my dearest Lord Warwick.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
Now, claim your bride.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she'd love to
get better acquainted.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Why?

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
I distinctly remember you
saying that I would be the one

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
crowned queen someday!

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
The current situation
has shifted.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
Anne.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
I've arranged for you to
wed Edward of Lancaster.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
You'll be the bride
of the future king.

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
Henceforth, the House of
Neville shares its fortune

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
with the House of Lancaster.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
This is awful...

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Yes. Absolutely awful!

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Isabelle...

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
How wonderful.

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
You will be crowned queen,
dear Anne.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
I was a fool for
getting carried away.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
I'm miserable. Simply miserable!

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Forgive me, sister.

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
With all due respect,
the misery is mine.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
I fooled myself into thinking
I understood Lord Richard.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
And those feelings
blossomed into love.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
This is mere ceremony.

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
Nothing more.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
My heart is not here.

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
Everyone has gathered.

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
If you please, proclaim it
once more, Warwick.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
Speak the name
of England's king.

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
On this joyous day,

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
the rightful king, as determined
by God in heaven returns

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
to the throne he
was always promised.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
Let us give thanks for being
able to praise his name.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
A true blessing.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Our sovereign...

00:21:56.733 --> 00:22:00.403 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] His Majesty,
King Henry the Sixth.
