00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
[COMMONER A] Who do you
wager will win the throne?

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
[COMMONER B]
My money's on George.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
[COMMONER C]
King George is a certainty.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center
That man has the Earl
of Warwick on his side.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center
There's not a soul in England
who could ever dream to beat

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
the Kingmaker at his own--

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll wager on Edward.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
[COMMONER A] That's typical
coming from a dame.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
All women want is
a good-looking man.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I suppose you're right.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
Oh, how I long to someday
see that handsome face

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
in the flesh.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, I heard
he's being held nearby.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
[COMMONER C]
He isn't here anymore.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
[COMMONER A] Perhaps I'd
be willing to tell you

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
where he went if you were
to show me a good time.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Tell me... or lose your life.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. My humblest apologies.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
If you must wait on me so,

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
do me a grand favor
and serve me a woman.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
Well, Edward.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
Allow me to grant your wish,
and serve to you...

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.360 position:50% align:center
...a woman's head.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people refer
to their strife as

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.588 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
No. You lie.
Tell me it isn't true.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
'Twas nothing but a jest.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to report
your wife fled.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
She escaped to an abbey before
my band could reach her.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
But we did find somebody
to take her place.

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
Gaze upon...

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
...the head of her
dearest father.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD grunts]
You traitor.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
Does your cruelty know
not a singular bound?

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
You needn't worry long.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
Once parliament meets to
formally remove the crown

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
from your head, and bestow
it unto the new king, George,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
she won't be worth the dress on
her back let alone bloodshed.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
Foolish. None but the
sovereign God has the right

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
to strip the
throne from me!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
If your throne is
not mine to take,

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
in piety, I may so well as
have God do the deed for me.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.279 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
It's just as I feared.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
I knew from the start that
Warwick was no friend of ours.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Does he plan
to send me back to France?

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
And treat our alliance
as some fickle whim?

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER A]
What was that, wench?

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[INN WOMAN A] How many
times must I repeat myself?

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
There's no room here!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
I suggest you chase out a
few paupers and make some!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
[INN WOMAN A gasps]

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
Just who are you?

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This heraldry... is Warwick's.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
A fine blade you have here, sir.
I think I'll keep it.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
Unhand that, bitch--

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Being slain by
a woman snuffs any chance

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
at the most meager of legacies.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
That would stain even
the honor bought by gold.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER A]
You damned shrews!

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
[INN WOMAN A]
Thank you for that.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
If you're in search
of a place to stay,

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
we have enough room for two.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
Do you really? It would be nice
to give the horses a rest.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
[INN WOMAN A]
Then please come in.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
How thrilling, all my days I've
never hosted a fugitive couple.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
[INN WOMAN A]
Welcome in!

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
Everyone, make room
for the newcomers!

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, it's--

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
It's more comfortable
than the ground.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
But, what if...?

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Make a wall of yourself, then.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
Pardon my reach.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
When I was a child,

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
I once woke you.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
I'd arisen from a horrid
nightmare and sought comfort.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I never expected
to again feel the warmth

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
of a body pressed on mine.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Not after that
day with you, Henry.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
[COMMONERS chatter]

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hm?

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIERS murmur]

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
It seems the blackguard
from yesterday

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
was indeed one of
Warwick's men, sire.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
My dear brother.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
He must be inside,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
but Catesby and I could
never rescue him alone.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
If only we had more allies.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Damn. I can't overlook
Warwick's treachery

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.436 position:50% align:center
and slink safely back to France.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
This duplicity could
doom my beloved.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Richard?

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Are you one
of Warwick's men?

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
No! I swear!

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
I came here as his guest, but
I've never granted the knave

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
an ounce of my trust.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
And yet you've followed
him for a matter of days.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] We must keep
our enemies closer, yes?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
I want to strike back
at him, don't you?

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
Do you even know who I am?

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
No!

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
All I know is that you're
a lady of celestial charms.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I want you to do me a favor.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
Allow me to accompany you
into the castle as your woman.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Is this but a dream?

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
I don't want my
face to be seen.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
Except while riding might
I ask the two of us act alone?

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
Oh, most certainly!

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] My wildest
fantasies have come true!

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
I'm to be the queen
to my George's king!

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
What could father
possibly be thinking?

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
Imprisoning His Majesty
in such a way.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] Steady your vision
and you'll see who's to blame!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
Father is seeking justice
for all the wrongs

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
that Edward dealt!

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Poor Richard.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
The moment we reach
the castle, and the troops

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
have dispersed, we must
ready ourselves for action.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
They'll be exhausted from travel
and at their least cautious.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
That makes sense.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
Based on how you've
been treated so far,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
you must be quite
the special guest.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
You have a degree of activity,
one that others aren't granted.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
Knowing that...

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
Do this. Offer me to the
imprisoned King Edward,

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
as a high-class courtesan.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
What? Offer you to that man?

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
How could I ever?

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
No! You must take
better care of yourself!

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
Me lying with a man is absurd.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
I would never actually
go that far.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
But I can make use of this body.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
This detestable form.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
I'll allow it... If it be
for the good of our goal.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
But, um... there is one
thing I need to know.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
H-Have you shed your maidenhead?

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
You have an incredible genius
for aggravating my nerves.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, have you a lover?

00:08:55.994 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Absolutely nothing of the kind,
and I never plan to.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]Ã©\
Can it be true?

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
She wasn't touched by Father?

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
Her body... remains pure?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
I can't!

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
Not after Richard's
bestowed her trust unto me.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] However, hhis
might be my only chance.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Your Grace!

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
Have these many
years of misfortune

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
come at the cost of my pride?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
I must remember I'm the
prince of Lancaster!

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
I'll take everything
my heart desires

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
openly with great pleasure!

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
After all, tis the heart
of the future king!

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
We've a moment till
we head to the inn.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
Care to take a look around?

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
For what purpose?

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, I...

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
I imagine a
"high-class courtesan"

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
should sport
somewhat finer attire.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Every man knows the surest way

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
to a woman's heart...
is with gifts!

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
What I have now should do it.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
You can't be too careful.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.946 position:50% align:center
What do you think of this?
Wouldn't it suit you nicely?

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
[MERCHANT A]
Care to try it on, madame?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
--No.
--Try it, I insist!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
Swordplay would be
quite a challenge.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
You look positively stunning!

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
This moment should
be made a portrait!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
How do you like it?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
All I need is some cloth
to conceal my face.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you
allow me to buy it?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
With elegant clothing, you would
look far more feminine!

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
That's precisely why I refused.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
So do I... look like
a woman to you?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course you do.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
What a perplexing maid.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
I knew winning her
wouldn't be so simple,

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
but that's part of her charm.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
It's quite crowded.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
Take care not to
lose sight of me.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Well then.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
I will be bold and
take my chance!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
It's difficult to walk. Let go.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
These berry pies smell divine,
would you like one?

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.310 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
Shopkeeper, we need
two pies! Quick!

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
Buy one more for me, please.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] For you,
I'd buy every pie in the land!

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Is it good? Would you
like mine, too?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to even try it?

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
I only bought these because
I could tell you wanted them.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
Was there nothing at the
market that you wanted?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] There's but
one thing I truly desire.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
And that is a crown.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
Well that's a laughable desire.
Only the king can have a crown.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
Obviously I comprehend, but I--

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The mere wish is a sin.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
Once we save the king,

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll be eager to thank
you with a circlet of gold.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
Now, wait!

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
Have you never wished
for something?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
Never wanted something
so desperately,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
that you would
commit a sin to get it?

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Even if I sin, I won't ever win.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER B] I'm tired
of being worked like a dog.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER C]
We're shorthanded.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
How can we not be with the
amount of fighting going on?

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
Sell it as I said.
Don't fail me.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
Have no fear. I'll preserve your
virtue at all costs, m'lady.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] A job well done,
indeed, my good men.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt my sudden
appearance has you both

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
highly suspicious, but I
do come with a purpose.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
I've brought Edward some
healthy prey to hunt.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER B]
The lucky devil.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
Now, if you would
please make way...

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Edward.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER C]
Excuse me.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
But The door will have to
remain open, just in case.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
So, we're to be watched.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
Who goes? An assassin, perhaps?

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
Come to end me once and for all?

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No, I'd never.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]
Wait, Ri--

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll forgive
my rudeness.

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
You see, I only wish to soothe
your woes with all my heart,

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
Lord Edward.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]
Well, aren't you just charming?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
Then have you any proof
of these intentions?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] Ah-ha. You've come
to me most prepared.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
My, what a rare opportunity.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
Guards. What say you men
to shutting that door

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
and joining us in our pleasure?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Why? Why do none come?

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
My Lord!

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
There are signs of discord
in nearly every region!

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
Lords report they are
pressed to respond

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
and cannot leave their lands!

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT C]
A request for aid, my lord!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT D]
Before that, this petition!

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] I'm king!
They should be reporting to me!

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
The lack of a king is the
root of all this strife.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
It will take legitimate
royal authority to subdue.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Then hurry and use
your authority to make me king!

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] I know you're
eager to claim the throne,

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
but a parliament must
be held to crown you.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Unless Edward was
to die, that is.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
If we circle around
from this side,

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
the guard should
be relatively lighter.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
Catesby is waiting with horses
right outside the castle,

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
so let's hurry.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
Um. These walls are quite high.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Take off your cloak,
else you'll drown.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll give Catesby
the signal after you jump.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
Almost there, Your Grace.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
Thank you, brother.
Trust you'll stay close.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Please make haste.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
A patrol's on the way.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Wait!

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Will you come along?

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I see. Then it
is here we must part.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
Try not to get yourself hanged.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
B-Before you go...

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.465 position:50% align:center
...take this.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
I bought it at the market.
Care for it as you would me.

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
We'll meet again.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
I'll see to it that we do.

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
And when I finally come for you,
I swear I shall be a king.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Your Majesty,
time and place demand speed.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Before we are found,
we must set sail.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
How could they have
caught up so soon.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD grunts]

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty,
King Edward the fourth.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
I am Lord Buckingham.
I am here to escort you.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
Your swiftness is
most impressive.

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Such loyalty will be remembered
and, in due time, rewarded.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
Please, Sire, relax at
your leisure this evening.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
I've also readied some women,
should you desire their company.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
How very thoughtful of you.

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
Presently, though,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
there's something I
desire more than women.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
I would dress if you
would take your leave.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center
What a shame,
those clothes suit you.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
How'd word of our great escape
manage to reach your ears?

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
I was looking for you.

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
Finding you with Edward in tow
was an unexpected bonus.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
A stroke of luck.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
Should it become a
war to avenge him,

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
your legitimacy will be
bolstered by this act.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to say?

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] The chance
hasn't passed you by.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Remove one of the thorns

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
in your throne
while you still can.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
If anyone questions your story,

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
just say he was already dead
when you arrived to rescue him.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
Do not mistake me.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
That which I'm seeking is
safety for the House of York.

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
I only crave one thing now,

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
and it is not the
warmth of a woman.

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
I want Warwick,
the man who mocked me.

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
For only his blood will suffice.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
I shall not feel joy,
not a single shred,

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
until my hands hold
his traitorous head.

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
How could he have escaped?

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER D] It seems
someone infiltrated the castle

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
and abducted him.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
He has any number of partisans.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
We haven't located
Richard yet, either.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
If our foes learn of
Edward's rescue,

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
it will increase their morale.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
So spread rumors that we
ourselves released him.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
There is no cause for alarm!

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter how many
men he adds to his army,

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
Edward could never defeat
us the way we are now!

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
Because I am the king!

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
We have the power of
the people on our side!

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Not quite.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
Our supporters have been halved
due to the lack of a sovereign.

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
Circumstances are as
uncertain as a tossing ship.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK SOLDIER E]
Halt!

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
I promise there's no need to
raise weapons against me.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
I'm his honored guest, am I not?

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
Who is this?

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
Did he just call himself king?
I couldn't hear all that well.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
So why don't you tell me?

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty, are you fully
prepared to kill your brother?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Kill?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
We should simply capture him
the same way we did before.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] As I thought,
I cannot win with George.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
Which leaves me with no choice.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
Warwick, who is the king?

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
My prince, I know what I said.

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
And as promised, I shall
offer you my daughter.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
He's your prince?
And you offered him who?

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
What is the meaning of this?
Tell me, Warwick!

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET chuckles]

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] I'm so very
grateful for this reunion, 

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
my dearest Lord Warwick.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
Now, claim your bride.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she'd love to
get better acquainted.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Why?

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
I distinctly remember you
saying that I would be the one

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
crowned queen someday!

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
The current situation
has shifted.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
Anne.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
I've arranged for you to
wed Edward of Lancaster.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
You'll be the bride
of the future king.

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
Henceforth, the House of
Neville shares its fortune

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
with the House of Lancaster.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
This is awful...

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Yes. Absolutely awful!

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Isabelle...

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
How wonderful.

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
You will be crowned queen,
dear Anne.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
I was a fool for
getting carried away.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
I'm miserable. Simply miserable!

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Forgive me, sister.

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
With all due respect,
the misery is mine.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
I fooled myself into thinking
I understood Lord Richard.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
And those feelings
blossomed into love.

00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
This is mere ceremony.

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
Nothing more.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
My heart is not here.

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
Everyone has gathered.

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
If you please, proclaim it
once more, Warwick.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
Speak the name
of England's king.

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
On this joyous day,

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
the rightful king, as determined
by God in heaven returns

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
to the throne he
was always promised.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
Let us give thanks for being
able to praise his name.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
A true blessing.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Our sovereign...

00:21:56.733 --> 00:22:00.403 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] His Majesty,
King Henry the Sixth.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
