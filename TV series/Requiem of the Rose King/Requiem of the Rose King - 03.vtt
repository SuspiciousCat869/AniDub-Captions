[EDWARD]
Oh, Warwick!

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
My father.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
Though his dukedom
may live on in me,

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
his spirit is no longer with us!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Edward.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center
If you are truly his son,
do not stop at a dukedom.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
Call yourself a king.
Claim the crown.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
Do so or you are no child
of Richard Plantagenet!

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
W-Warwick?

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
My troops will proclaim you,

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
Richard's eldest son, as the
rightful heir to the throne.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
London has barred its gates
against the Lancastrians.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
If our enemy withdraws
north to their base,

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
then that's where this
war will culminate.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] Gentlemen. This next
battle will shape our future.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center
Those who give their
hearts for England,

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.442 position:50% align:center
march proudly under my banner!

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
There was a time my father
referred to you as the

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
"savior of his soul."

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
You are my savior as well.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
Let us vow to chain our souls
together as we face our fates.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
O Warwick, I do bend
my knee with thine.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
If you fall, so shall I.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.418 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I have no need of tears.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] Our mourning
clothes are steel armor.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.381 position:50% align:center
And our blades of
vengeance are ready

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:32.133 position:50% align:center
to rain down on
Lancastrian helms!

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.552 position:50% align:center
O Lord, grant us Your strength!

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No matter how much I weep,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:42.018 position:50% align:center
merely breathing is enough to
stoke the fires of my rage,

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.729 position:50% align:center
and burn my body to ashes.

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:58.159 position:50% align:center
These royal houses with
their flowered crests

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people refer
to their strife as

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.794 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.635 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
Apologies.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
I was lucky enough to find love.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
If I'm also lucky enough to
live through this coming battle,

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
I swore I would be with her.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
I pray you jest,

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
or are you no longer
fighting to be king?

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
I am ever the most
serious fellow.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
I vowed to be by your side
as well, and here I am.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Where... am I?

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What am I doing?

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Everywhere I look is pitch dark.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Loose your arrows!

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The only color I see,

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
from beneath this pall,

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
Is blood red.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A groans]

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
How many must we carve away
before they close with us?

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.968 position:50% align:center
We'll see. Depends on
what God wills.

[RICHARD]
What do I desire?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
Something that will quench
these all-consuming fires.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
For my tears cannot.

[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER B]
Go!

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
Crush the Yorkists
in a single charge!

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
Leave this to me!
You head to the rear!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
I swore an oath to
stand with you!

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
Upon Heaven's name!

Look, Warwick. The sun.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Blood! It's blood that I need!

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
More! More! More!

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
Let me drown in it!

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
They have reinforcements?

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER C] Yes.
They number in the thousands.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
The men's morale is
already suffering.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
We must retreat
while we still can.

[MARGARET grunts]

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
That sun's a good omen,
to be sure!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
Heaven sides with us!

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
Now is the time to advance
and avenge my father!

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The world's a dark place,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
and what little light I
had was stolen. Forever.

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
In the dark, the colour of
blood is all my eyes drink in,

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
so I'll paint the
world as I see it.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
With blood! Blood! Blood! Blood!

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I will stain
everything with blood.

Are you... a Lancastrian?

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
Please help me. I can't move.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
My family... They're back
home waiting for me.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
I can't see.
I don't know your face.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
I don't know you.

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
It's too dark out.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
Here's a thought.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
Make your face a different hue.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
Then I could see.

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Ah.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
Even without light, the world
will still be in colour.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Red as blood-stained roses.

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Cloaked in darkness no longer.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER C]
Look. This one's breathing.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER D] So put
a sword through his lung.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER C] I would,
but his rose is so bloody

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if
it's white or red.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Hold. This one I know.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts] Catesby.
I'm amazed you recognized me.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
A slight feat for someone who's
known you since your birth.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:55.118 position:50% align:center
I've been charged with
one significant role in life,

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
and that's simply to
remain at your side.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
Through both the
good and the bad.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
You needn't feel bound
by such loyalty.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
After all, my father's
no longer of this world.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Which is why I
resigned from my post 

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
and went in search of you.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
My wish is to deliver you
into your mother's arms.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
You will take refuge with
her and Lord George,

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
for, officially,
you all fled together.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50% align:center
So that is as it must be.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
It's also what your father
would have desired.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
Yes. You speak true.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
If he were still here,
he would no doubt want that.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I am the shadow.
The darkness behind the light.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
Hear this proclamation I make
as your proud and noble king!

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
Today ends our suffering!

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
Victory is ours!

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER E]
Long live King Edward!

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
But that's quite all right.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
I'll go on walking alone,
even in the dark.

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I've learned a
means to see me through.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Are you still dressing, Richard?

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
Sorry, George. I'm ready now.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
It's about time.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
You know if you let the servants
assist, you wouldn't be so late.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Punctuality wasn't an issue
when Catesby was here.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
Well, things change.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
Especially over the
course of two years.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
He has moved on from
the House of York.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Fair.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center

Hastings these days.

I know!

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
It's almost as if he

Hm!

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center

Without him,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center

have emerged triumphant.

Lord George and Lord Richard

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
have grown quite
handsome, as well.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE A] True, but Lord
Richard rather frightens me.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
He seems so unapproachable.

are crowned with victory, 

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
our battle-scarred armor is a
mere commemorative decoration.

[EDWARD]
Brothers! Come forth!

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
Richard. I'm told that
you've barred servants

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
from entering your chambers.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.168 position:50% align:center
As Duke of Gloucester,
such behaviors won't do.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.795 position:50% align:center
In order for one to stay on top,

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
one must rely on
those beneath them.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Forgive me.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
I don't want them
to see my frail body.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
Pathetic, I know.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
It's true you're slender.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
And your skin is no doubt
as smooth as a maiden's.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
But you needn't
be ashamed, Brother.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
Your worth as a man
is not measured

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
by such petty grievances.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
Do tell. How is such
value determined?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD chuckles]
By women, of course.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
Take a look round the court.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
Nothing but lovely ladies here.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
Do any of these fair
creatures interest you?

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'd only
disappoint them

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
with you in the same vicinity.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
Alas, my hand is
already promised

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
to a lady who hails from France.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
The engagement is formally
being pursued by Warwick.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
Listen, my brothers!
For this is a royal decree!

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
You are to choose partners
from the maidens here

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
and enjoy the day with them!

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
Richard. What now?

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
You're even worse at this
sort of thing than I am.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
It's just for this celebration.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
Merely making a choice
will satisfy His Majesty.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gruntds] You know,
ever since Father was taken,

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
it's like you became
someone else.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
The only thing that
I "became" was an adult.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
Anne! Come on.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
Let's go put ourselves
in the running tonight!

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I respectfully decline.
Men are just not my forte.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
Oh, honestly, Anne.
"Men" may not be your forte,

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
but there's one man you can't
shake from your thoughts.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I just don't want to, all right?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
You can join in on your own!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
[ANNE yelps]

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
Well, well...

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
Hello, Anne Neville.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
Oh, Lord Richard.
I, um... I'm sorry!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
I know several
years have passed,

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
but I'd still like to apologize!

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
If my words offended you,
that was not my intent.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
It was purely accidental.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
I've been hoping... you and
I maybe could, one day,

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
perhaps be friends?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
Come. Let's dance.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
So suave! Where'd he learn that?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
If Lord Richard is going
to attend my sister,

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
then, of course, his brother
should attend me!

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
I was right. Both of my brothers
have eyes for women.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
And impeccable taste, since
they chose to partner with

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
your daughters.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
Dare I say I envy my own kin.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
I trust this French bride-to-be
that you have selected for me

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
is quite the beauty as well?

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
I will provide nothing
but the best.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
And that's precisely why
I've decided never to act

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
without your approval first.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
I would not be sitting on
this throne if not for you,

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
and I acknowledge as much.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST GUARD A]
Wait!

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] Your Royal Majesty,
I beg of you.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
This is a celebration.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Formal requests can be made--

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I'm aware. I've made
many requests in the past.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
I'm here before you because I've
yet to be granted an audience.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
My late husband's territory
was confiscated during the war,

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
and I would kindly ask
Your Majesty to return it.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
Confiscated land?

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
If it was taken
because of the war,

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
then that would make your
late husband Lancastrian.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Your courage
is a true marvel.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
What is your name?

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
My liege.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
My name is Elizabeth Woodville,
Your Majesty.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
Very well then. I will hear
out your claim in full.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
But not in the midst
of a banquet.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
Leave us.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
Your grace.
About your engagement

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
to the French princess
we were discussing.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
It's so strange.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
That Elizabeth.
Have we met before?

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
[JOAN chuckles]

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
Come out and show yourself.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
[JOAN] You used to tremble and
fear, but now you're used to me.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
It's quite dull. Heh.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What's so funny?

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
You've fallen in love.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
With beautiful Elizabeth?

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Nonsense.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
There's a woman
in your thoughts.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
Adorable Anne?

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
I'm not the type
to fall in love.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't love someone
like you in return.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
[JOAN]
Not with this body.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
[JOAN]
I jest.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
After all, you already
long for another, yes?

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
Richard. You are neither
man nor woman.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
Yet, you are both man and woman.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Rubbish. I'm not
in love with anyone.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
No one.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SERVANT A]
Queen Margaret!

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
King Henry's spirit has
at last returned to him!

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET gasps]

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
Where am I?
I can't recall a thing.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
We're presently in Scotland.

00:16:57.392 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
Those inhuman Yorkists
usurped the throne from you.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
Then they forced us--

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
Us! The legitimate
royal family, into exile!

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
So the war is over?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET grunts] What a
wretched state of affairs!

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
If York won, I'm not the king.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
I'm free now. I'm free.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] All right.
What's gotten into you, Edward?

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
This hunting trip was so sudden.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
It is quite nice to hunt without
a crowd every once in a while.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
The sun is shining as
brightly as it was the

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
momentous day we claimed victory
on the snowy battlefield.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
I stared in awe as that
brilliant orb split into three,

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
only to rejoin as one.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
I knew instantly those three
suns were we three brothers.

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
It was as if God Himself were
commanding us to combine our 

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
strength and govern
this nation in concert.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
We brothers York are
under the sun's aegis.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
We should give thanks for
its blessing and strengthen

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
our bonds by hunting
under its light.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Now! Tally ho!

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
Let us have a game to bring
down the largest game!

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
Someone's in a good humor today.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
How I've longed to see you.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
I trust you've read
my letter, Elizabeth.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
Every word.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
I have.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
You wrote you would yield
my husband's lands to me.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
I also wrote such an exchange
would come at a price.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
Give me your love and
you'll have your lands.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
My king, I am a proud citizen
of this country of England.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
My love is eternally yours
to have, Your Majesty.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
And I thank you.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
But 'tis the fruits of love
I desire from your tree.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Put plainly...

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
...my aim is to lie with you.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
I'll speak plainly, too.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
For I would rather lie in
a prison cell, your grace.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
You would give up your lands and
slay a king to save your honor?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
You are the very first woman who
has ever refused me, Elizabeth.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
I must say, I grow all the more
eager to test you by the second.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
Wait, please. I recognize
that I am too lowborn

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
to be a prospective queen.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
I also recognize I am too
noble to be your concubine.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
"My queen?" Such daring does
not suit the graceful features

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
you've been blessed with.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
Ha! How amusing.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
You would take the crown
that comes with my hand?

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
Queen Elizabeth?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
Those who love Your Majesty
would never permit it.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
Even those most loyal.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
But they are not here.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
And the sole person my
heart has love for is you.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
I'm no longer asking
for a reply.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
Laws are born from
the king's choice.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
And I choose you.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] So this is why he
suddenly wanted to hunt.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

You were watching?

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
For the time being, Richard,

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
this secret stays
between us two.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
Soon, though,
I'll shout it to the world.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
For I've decided to
make her my queen.

[ANTHONY]
What is this letter?!

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
Your husband's dead because of
King Edward and his Yorkists--

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Anthony.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
Do you know what this
small trinket is?

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
It's John's keepsake.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
Edward could write
a thousand letters,

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
I'd still love only one man.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
Enough to seek his
divine vengeance.

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
I'll become the queen of England
and bend the king to my will.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
Those murderers
will soon be ours.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
I have Edward in the
palm of my hand.

[WARWICK]
Edward's wedding arrangements

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center
with France are going well.

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
This union will bring the
Yorks even greater power.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
Your son has grown to
resemble you so much more.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
At times, I mistake him
for you, King Richard.

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
Now until my end days, I swear
I will defend your crown.

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
I will foil every foe,
no matter what.

[YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
Hey, have ya heard?

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
They say King Edward
frequently comes hunting

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
around these parts.

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.070 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER B]
In disguise?

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:01.446 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
Well, of course.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
Though we should be the
ones hiding when he's near.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.784 position:50% align:center
Hiding our daughters
and wives, that is!

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:07.243 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWERS laugh]

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
Pardon me. There's someone
I'm desperately seeking out.
