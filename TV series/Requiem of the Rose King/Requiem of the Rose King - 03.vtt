And your skin is no doubt
as smooth as a maiden's.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
But you needn't
be ashamed, Brother.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
Your worth as a man
is not measured

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
by such petty grievances.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
Do tell. How is such
value determined?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD chuckles]
By women, of course.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
Take a look round the court.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
Nothing but lovely ladies here.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
Do any of these fair
creatures interest you?

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'd only
disappoint them

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
with you in the same vicinity.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
Alas, my hand is
already promised

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
to a lady who hails from France.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
The engagement is formally
being pursued by Warwick.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
Listen, my brothers!
For this is a royal decree!

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
You are to choose partners
from the maidens here

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
and enjoy the day with them!

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
Richard. What now?

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
You're even worse at this
sort of thing than I am.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
It's just for this celebration.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
Merely making a choice
will satisfy His Majesty.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gruntds] You know,
ever since Father was taken,

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
it's like you became
someone else.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
The only thing that
I "became" was an adult.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
Anne! Come on.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
Let's go put ourselves
in the running tonight!

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I respectfully decline.
Men are just not my forte.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
Oh, honestly, Anne.
"Men" may not be your forte,

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
but there's one man you can't
shake from your thoughts.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I just don't want to, all right?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
You can join in on your own!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
[ANNE yelps]

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
Well, well...

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
Hello, Anne Neville.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
Oh, Lord Richard.
I, um... I'm sorry!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.977 position:50% align:center
I know several
years have passed,

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
but I'd still like to apologize!

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
If my words offended you,
that was not my intent.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
It was purely accidental.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
I've been hoping... you and
I maybe could, one day,

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
perhaps be friends?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
Come. Let's dance.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
So suave! Where'd he learn that?

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
If Lord Richard is going
to attend my sister,

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
then, of course, his brother
should attend me!

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
I was right. Both of my brothers
have eyes for women.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
And impeccable taste, since
they chose to partner with

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
your daughters.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
Dare I say I envy my own kin.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
I trust this French bride-to-be
that you have selected for me

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
is quite the beauty as well?

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
I will provide nothing
but the best.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
And that's precisely why
I've decided never to act

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
without your approval first.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
I would not be sitting on
this throne if not for you,

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
and I acknowledge as much.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST GUARD A]
Wait!

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] Your Royal Majesty,
I beg of you.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
This is a celebration.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Formal requests can be made--

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I'm aware. I've made
many requests in the past.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
I'm here before you because I've
yet to be granted an audience.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
My late husband's territory
was confiscated during the war,

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
and I would kindly ask
Your Majesty to return it.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
Confiscated land?

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
If it was taken
because of the war,

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
then that would make your
late husband Lancastrian.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Your courage
is a true marvel.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
What is your name?

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
My liege.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
My name is Elizabeth Woodville,
Your Majesty.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
Very well then. I will hear
out your claim in full.

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
But not in the midst
of a banquet.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
Leave us.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
Your grace.
About your engagement

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
to the French princess
we were discussing.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
It's so strange.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
That Elizabeth.
Have we met before?

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
[JOAN chuckles]

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
Come out and show yourself.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
[JOAN] You used to tremble and
fear, but now you're used to me.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
It's quite dull. Heh.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What's so funny?

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
You've fallen in love.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
With beautiful Elizabeth?

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Nonsense.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
There's a woman
in your thoughts.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
Adorable Anne?

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
I'm not the type
to fall in love.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't love someone
like you in return.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
[JOAN]
Not with this body.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
[JOAN]
I jest.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
After all, you already
long for another, yes?

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
Richard. You are neither
man nor woman.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
Yet, you are both man and woman.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Rubbish. I'm not
in love with anyone.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
No one.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SERVANT A]
Queen Margaret!

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
King Henry's spirit has
at last returned to him!

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET gasps]

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
Where am I?
I can't recall a thing.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
We're presently in Scotland.

00:16:57.392 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
Those inhuman Yorkists
usurped the throne from you.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
Then they forced us--

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
Us! The legitimate
royal family, into exile!

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
So the war is over?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET grunts] What a
wretched state of affairs!

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
If York won, I'm not the king.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
I'm free now. I'm free.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] All right.
What's gotten into you, Edward?

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
This hunting trip was so sudden.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
It is quite nice to hunt without
a crowd every once in a while.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
The sun is shining as
brightly as it was the

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
momentous day we claimed victory
on the snowy battlefield.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
I stared in awe as that
brilliant orb split into three,

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
only to rejoin as one.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
I knew instantly those three
suns were we three brothers.

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
It was as if God Himself were
commanding us to combine our 

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
strength and govern
this nation in concert.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
We brothers York are
under the sun's aegis.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
We should give thanks for
its blessing and strengthen

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
our bonds by hunting
under its light.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Now! Tally ho!

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
Let us have a game to bring
down the largest game!

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
Someone's in a good humor today.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
How I've longed to see you.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
I trust you've read
my letter, Elizabeth.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
Every word.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
I have.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
You wrote you would yield
my husband's lands to me.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
I also wrote such an exchange
would come at a price.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
Give me your love and
you'll have your lands.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
My king, I am a proud citizen
of this country of England.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
My love is eternally yours
to have, Your Majesty.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
And I thank you.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
But 'tis the fruits of love
I desire from your tree.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Put plainly...

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
...my aim is to lie with you.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
I'll speak plainly, too.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
For I would rather lie in
a prison cell, your grace.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
You would give up your lands and
slay a king to save your honor?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
You are the very first woman who
has ever refused me, Elizabeth.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
I must say, I grow all the more
eager to test you by the second.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
Wait, please. I recognize
that I am too lowborn

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
to be a prospective queen.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
I also recognize I am too
noble to be your concubine.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
"My queen?" Such daring does
not suit the graceful features

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
you've been blessed with.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
Ha! How amusing.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
You would take the crown
that comes with my hand?

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
Queen Elizabeth?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
Those who love Your Majesty
would never permit it.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
Even those most loyal.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
But they are not here.

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
And the sole person my
heart has love for is you.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
I'm no longer asking
for a reply.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
Laws are born from
the king's choice.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
And I choose you.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] So this is why he
suddenly wanted to hunt.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
