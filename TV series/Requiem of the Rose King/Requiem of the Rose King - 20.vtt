Edward the Fifth should
still be on the throne,

King of England, after all.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
Forgiveness? An apology? Or...

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard!

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] No, there was
little words could ever do.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I simply came
here so I could see you.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Uh?

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
So how are you feeling?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
Henry.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
When I'm with you,

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center line:84%
cracks start to form in
my soundest judgment.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
I try to set my passions aside,
but I can't.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center line:84%
Merely thinking
a piece of your heart

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
belongs to someone
else drives me mad.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
Efforts to find a solution
to this delicate issue

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
are all for naught.

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] My mind
goes completely blank.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Save for one question.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
What can I do to make
you mine alone?

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard, this can't go on.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] You fainted,
I shouldn't have pushed you.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I'm fine,
and my physician agrees.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Physician? You summoned Jane?

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Yes.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] And she
found nothing wrong?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
She... has a theory.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JANE] Well, Your Majesty
enjoys regular intercourse

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
with a partner.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust you can reach
your own conclusion, yes?

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Of course.
That's impossible for me.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, if it's true--

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
I assure you it's not.
What a nightmare.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM gasps]
But there's a chance since

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
it was Jane's prognosis.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
And there's a remedy.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
What remedy?

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Do not fear.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center line:84%
All of this is nothing more
than Jane's absurd fancies.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
It isn't the truth.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
More importantly, Henry.
Come to York with me.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am to be crowned in
the city of my father,

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I want you to be at my side.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
We won this battle together.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter how persistent
the briars were,

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
you cut them down for me.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] Are you
physically up for the journey?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
As long as you're with me,

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be the strongest
I've ever felt.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Relaxing has
restored my appetite.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hardly took a bite
before I took that fall.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] Then I shall
bring you some food.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
His Grace, the Duke,
is serving me?

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
This pain, what is it?

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center line:84%
And there's a remedy.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] Feels as though my
entrails are being gouged out.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
Time and time again
have I endeavored

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
to discard my love for you.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
To cool my head and properly
plot measures against

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
the thorn that is Prince Edward.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everything for the
sake of the crown.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, I was wrong!

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center line:84%
The crown is not
what I truly desire!

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
I fell for my own fabrication.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because ever since the
day Richard and I met,

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center line:84%
there was but one thing I wanted
from the bottom of my heart.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD grunts]

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasping]
What? Why am I chained up?

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Good morning.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]
Henry, explain!

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
You won't be making
the journey to York.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
You will remain here with me.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
You would dare impede
the coronation?

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Yes.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Enough with
your irrational farce!

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
This is no farce.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
In time, your hair will
grow out like a black veil

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center line:84%
until it brushes past
your slender shoulders.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then no one will
recognize you as

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center line:84%
"King Richard the Third."

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Are you mad?

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I will announce
to the public how gravely ill

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
the king has become.
Leave governance to me.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Such a feeble excuse.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know this is what
you want, too!

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] That night, our
desires were one and the same.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you were no longer king,
we could be together always.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
We needn't lose our love.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
We can keep it.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] Should I go
to check on His Majesty?

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though it's not my place, he did
promise to return by morning.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
And King Richard is not the type
of person to break a promise.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I'll take you
outside once you calm down.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have places to show you.
Beautiful places.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
I won't keep you shut up
in a tower forever.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
Another part of my plan is
to arrange for a house

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
where we can live in secret.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Live with Henry
in the woods somewhere?

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:13.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
Become a "nameless" woman,
unknown to anyone.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
To be swathed in an
embrace of warmth.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
To taste golden dew of sleep.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center line:84%
Such is far too good
for a demon child.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] To obtain a love
I thought would never be

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
within my grasp.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] What more could
a devil dare to wish?

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
What's wrong?

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Nothing.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Here, hold out your hand.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
I give this ring, proof of
my soul's pledge to you.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
What more can I ask for?

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JOAN] Congratulations.
Never again will you freeze

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
alone in the dark, cowering from
the voices of your curse.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center line:84%
Isn't that right?

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I did want this.
To extend our time together

00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center line:84%
for as long as possible.
To throw everything away.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
My blood. My name.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even my title.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST GUARD B]
I already told you,

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center line:84%
His Majesty departed
this morning.

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] That can't be true!
Let me speak to the duke!

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Richard.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] When I was young,
I was held prisoner many times.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
I imagine you were
as well, Henry.

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
Someone with power was
always inhibiting our freedom

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
because our lives
belonged to them.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yet we cursed our impotence
and struggled against fate.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do these not symbolize the
briars we strove to clear?

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:38.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
A part of me desired this.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
I told you as much with that
starlit sky as my witness.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center line:84%
But you know of my
deepest wish: the crown.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] The future
we swore together is--

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[CATESBY grunts]
--[BUCKINGHAM gasps]

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[CATESBY] Your Majesty!
--[RICHARD] Catesby!

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] You were
late to arrive back,

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I saw you in the window.
Explain yourself now, Duke.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] That's enough.
Sheathe your sword.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center line:84%
Buckingham, release me.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] Was it wise to
let him go unpunished?

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] The crimes he's
committed are my own.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Follow me once you are
ready. I'll be waiting in York.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
He will come to the coronation.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know it. He's my other half.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Richard, what do you desire?

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is it truly the crown?
An empty circle of cold metal?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
A plucked petal can
never rejoin the stem.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will you choose a future of
sleepless nights in the depths

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
of despair, crushed by the
weight of the extraordinary

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
garden of love you've lost?

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, the thorns that bind
you now are not mine.

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
The blood staining your throne
and the "name of a king" are...

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] Henry, have you
decided on your wish?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
If we make good time,

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
we can meet the royal procession
to York at the church up ahead.

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure you know
the one I mean.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center line:84%
That I do, for it's where
my brother George is buried.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll say a prayer for
him while I'm there.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
Edward of Lancaster is
entombed there as well.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
He is, indeed.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
The father of the
boy I call "son."

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A] Does someone
you used to know rest here?

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Members of my family.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
It's so quiet.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center line:84%
The clamor of the city,
and the days I spent at war,

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
seem as though
they never were.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A] Many soldiers
perished in this region

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
during perhaps the most
fierce and decisive battle

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the war.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
Among them was the
Lancastrian Prince Edward.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Yes, I fought
here that day myself.

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though it's but a token,
please accept this.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A]
Thank you, my lord.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
You remind me of the
late prince's father,

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
King Henry the Sixth.

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
He was as pious and
compassionate as they come,

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
much like you.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then there's the reigning king.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Do tell. What sort
of man is the reigning king?

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A] A monstrous
villain who slew his friends

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
and brothers alike
in his rise to power.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised to
learn he murdered a child

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center line:84%
in order to further
his ambitions.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A] Richard the
Third is a demon king.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Yes, he's right.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
I did become a demon,
all so I could gain my crown.

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
I ensnared, robbed,
and struck down

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
every person that
stood in my way.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
He and I became demons together.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
But now...

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A gasps]
That gentleman. Is he perhaps?

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:13.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
The light is overhead.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE PRIEST 5A] Your Majesty,
King Richard the Third!

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll make it a point to
visit more frequently

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
and pay my respects.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall teach all
the people of England

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
who Richard the Third is.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
They'll know his name, his face,
and of course, his power.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
My reign has just begun.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELY gasps] Has my sentence been
passed, or have you merely come

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
to torment me for your
own entertainment?

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can never tell with you.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though you act high and mighty,
you're a sinner just like me!

00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
You think you're untouchable,
you'll get what's coming to you!

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's as you say.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I was an accomplice
in usurping the throne.

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
I led innocents astray.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please forgive me,
Your Excellency.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard is both bewitching
and beautiful,

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was beguiled by his devilish
charisma and took leave

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
of my senses.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
I trust you will understand.

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELY] Uh, of course!
Even a saint would be

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
hard-pressed to
resist his charms!

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you cast aside this
sin and live anew,

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm certain God will have
mercy on your soul!

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
I came here to do just that.

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:40.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
Bishop of Ely, let us atone
for our sins together.

[TYRRELL] Henry, have you
decided on your wish?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center line:84%

Yes.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I shall grant you the
knowledge you seek in exchange.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
James Tyrrell, find King
Richard the Third...

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
