00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
O Lord. With your
grace divine, heal Father.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.688 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH laughs]

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] I'm in awe of
your stunning performance,

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
Your Grace. How we
have awaited this.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Edward. You were
everything I am not.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
Once a mirror image of Father.
Perfection personified.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
But, now...

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
...you look terrible.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
R-Richard...

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
You are no king...

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
...if death claims you
without a fight, Brother.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Your time has come, Edward.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
Shall we go?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.486 position:50% align:center
You must atone for
a number of sins.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
Even royalty does not
spare one from that fate.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.455 position:50% align:center
As you say, Warwick.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:31.257 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
These royal houses
with their flowered crests

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.013 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.853 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center
[MALE PRIEST A] In the name
of the Father, the Son,

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
That was certainly abrupt.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
Death gives no warning
before it takes its hold,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
and permits no resistance.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
Just as when you strike down
a man on the field of battle.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
Death must stay very busy.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
Buckingham.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
Can you remember the face of
the first person you killed?

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
No. What of it?

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Earlier, I recalled mine.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
John Grey.
Elizabeth's former husband.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.966 position:50% align:center
Well, the official story is he
was slain by a nameless soldier.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
Why divulge this?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
I swore to keep no secrets.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM gasps]

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Know that I have wagered
everything on you.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
Do not betray me.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Today is All Fool's Day!

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
Men are women,
children are adults,

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
why in this world gone mad, even
a beggar can be crowned as king!

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
[MALE FOOL A] Would you perhaps
like a crown of your own?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
I would never, because I
can't become king.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
The world's been turned
upside down as of today.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
Meaning even a demon
could be king here.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Lord Richard.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
I have urgent tidings from
Lord Hastings, Your Grace.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
Earl of Rivers aims to
make himself Protector.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
It's his intent to bring
the Prince of Wales

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
to the palace with a large army.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
I have troops in
readiness as well.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50% align:center
I shall leave to greet
His Highness post haste.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
The people and parliament
will recognize me

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
as the new king's
regent soon enough.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
I'll simply escort young
Edward to his castle

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
and make a show of
our dignity and virtue.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
That is well and good, Anthony,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
but fetching the prince
is not your only job.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
You are to seize Richard

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
and immediately
take him to the Tower.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
He's the one who
murdered my sweet John,

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center
so I shall see to
his death firsthand.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY chuckles]

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
I wish I'd known sooner,

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
but I'm still grateful that I
could learn the truth at all.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
So thank you for telling me,
Buckingham, my kingmaker.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
Once Gloucester hears
Rivers has moved,

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt he'll pursue at
the head of a substantial force.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
I suggest that you
call on him alone.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
Dine with him and share
a cup in friendship.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
Then simply arrest him for
treason once his guard is down.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] What if his
troops were to surround us

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
in the meantime?

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
I've troops, too.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
And they're prepared to kill
Richard should that happen.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
So you've nothing to fear.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
You all expect me to
appear in these rags?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
I'm a king, not some
impoverished nobleman.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
But Your Royal Highness--

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD V] That's wrong, too!
It's "Your Majesty" from now on!

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Ah, my deepest apologies,
Your Majesty.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
What a spoiled
little shit he is.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD V] Another thing that
I lack for is companions,

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
so why hasn't Gloucester
come to join us here yet?

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
The duke is close
at hand, Grace.

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
The Earl of Rivers shall
arrive with him anon.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
You should take your rest
here tonight, Your Majesty.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
Give your uncles
time to catch up.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
Ah, welcome, Richard!
I've been waiting for you!

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
Well met, Rivers.
This is your escort?

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
Indeed it is.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] He's supposed
to have a whole army.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
What is the meaning of this?

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Where is the Prince of Wales?

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
Pardon my saying so, but your
numbers appear too few

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50% align:center
for his guard, do they not?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
Why would I bolster my forces
when I knew that you would come?

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
May all past grudges be
washed away, Richard.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
I'd question why your
numbers are so great

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
if I did not think
it was to defend us.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
Oh, my dear brother-in-law!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
Let's drop our swords and join
hands in support of the new 

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
sovereign so that the departed
king's soul may rest in peace.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
Enjoy a goblet of wine.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
We're overdue for a good
time after all the sorrow

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
we've endured.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY snores]

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
The earl's had a bit
much to drink.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.175 position:50% align:center
Will you bear him
to his chambers?

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
I shall retire as well.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Though your master
warned us of impending danger,

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
there's none.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
That may be so, but let's still
keep our wits about us.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] He wants to
"join hands in support

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
of our new sovereign?"

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
The only thing I want
is the stability of York.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
I even sacrificed
George to secure it.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Why did my father
wish to become king?

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
Such light's out of reach.
What hope do I cling?

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
[rustling]

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hm?

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
Halt!

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
A thief?

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
I suggest that you keep quiet.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
If the secrets of this
body were revealed,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
people would wanna see it burn.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
Though you've forgotten me,
I remember you.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Clear as day.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
Deep in the woods,
there was a vacant house,

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
save for one child wearing a
filthy cloak and loose armor.

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
And what did I find beneath it?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
The body of a demon.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
That man. It was him?

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
I reckon you believe your
soldiers will protect you

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
from any harm, don't you?

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
Well, I managed to
garner the support

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
of a few soldiers myself.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right...

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.424 position:50% align:center
...Lord Buckingham?

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
So you won't deny the
ravings of this lunatic?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
Why are you even
here on this night?

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
If you will.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
[ripping]

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
Ya see? This proves
that he's a demon.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.072 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
I didn't fully believe it.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
I had to behold it
with my own eyes.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
But now you understand.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
This monster snuck
into the royal family

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
to ruin the kingdom!
I'm sure of it!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Strangely, I feel nothing.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
This is a natural outcome.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
Light... will never shine
its warm rays on a demon.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
Somehow I always knew that
God was watching over me!

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
When do I get my
title and my gold?

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
You said you'd free
me from this life!

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
I will grant you
what you desire.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
[MALE ROBBER A groans]

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What is this about?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Further conversation

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
with such garbage would
lower the worth of my soul.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
Will you slay me as well?

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
Rivers has devised a
plan to arrest you

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
in the morning on
suspicion of treachery.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
Needless to say, the Woodvilles
haven't the slightest intention

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
of sharing power with you.

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
What's more, this body
makes you hardly "worthy"

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
of wearing the crown.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why did you hide it from me?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Did you fear the knowledge
would make me despair?

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Did you fear to lose me?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lose you?

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
That's right. When we met,
I thought you a woman.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
And my imagination was correct.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Stop! I'm a man!

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Hmm. Indeed.
You are that as well.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
But has your "womanhood"
ever known love?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
All this time,

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
you've lived hiding
your true self.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
I can tell.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
We're two of a kind.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
If you offer up your
hidden self to me,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
here and now, then I would
become a demon's other half.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
[MALE FOREST VOICE A]
Look at you.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center

Demon.

[MALE FOREST VOICE B]
All bloodstained flawed.

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE FOREST VOICE B]
Your very birth...

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICES]
...defied the will of God.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Richard, this is
your last chance.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
Will you seize what
you truly want,

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
or perish with nothing in hand?

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
The choice is all yours.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
--[BUCKINGHAM] Come.
--[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
Say it. What is
it that you desire?

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you want.
What you've always wanted!

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
I want...

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
Say it, Richard.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I want,
above all else, the crown!

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
Very well. Then I shall
put it in your hands.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] What I want is
for you to remember this pain.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
It's the seal of our covenant.

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
The pain of this sin
we commit together.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Despite my prayers
and wishful thinking,

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
the voices of my
curse never faded.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
If the lost warmth
I've foolishly clung to

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
all these years can
never be mine again.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
If it will let me
escape destiny...

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] ...then a dark,
blood-soaked demon I shall be.

prepared for you, Your Grace.

Please allow me
to help you dress.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center

are convinced I betrayed you

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
and are now their dog.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard!

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
Worry not, Catesby. I cared
for Richard last night.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center

Good morning, Earl Rivers.
I trust you slept well.

[ANTHONY] Too well! My plan to
ease Richard got me intoxicated!

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
So then, is everything
going as we planned?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY]
Once Richard's out of the way,

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
I'll be the mightiest
man in England!

As the king's proxy,
I command everyone here;

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
find and arrest
the arrant traitor!

in regard to that subject,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
I wanted to hurry to London

got arrested and held us up!

No! What did you say?

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty attended to their
sugared words for years,

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
but looked not on the poison

charge me with crimes

I did not commit.

You are safe now, Your Majesty.

Should any villain upset
the peace of this land,

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
I'll see that each and every one
of them is purged from it.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
Let us proceed to the palace.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] What in
God's name has happened?

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
No. This can't be.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Well done.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
You've freed the palace
of your enemies.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
What of Elizabeth?

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Is there the smallest
chance she still trusts you?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
I have any number of ways to
ensure that's indeed the case.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
She's even gone so far as to
dub me her "kingmaker."

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Hm? What's wrong?
Are you jealous?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
Just remember I called
you my kingmaker first.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
But I do still want
you to play her ally.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
We can use Elizabeth again.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
As you wish, my king.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Your Grace.
His Majesty is calling for you.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Developed a
hobby for spying, I see.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
Next time, I'll let you
watch the entire thing.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
I gave you fair warning,
Lord Buckingham.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
All who harm Lord Richard
must answer to me.

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
But if it's something he wants,

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
even if he knows that something
will only hurt him...

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
I've taken the role of
a demon's other half

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
so that I may fulfill
Richard's fantasies.

Can you do as much?

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
Can you dirty those hands
with the blood of God?

[gasps]

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] The clever devil
discovered the whole plot,

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
including the depths
of your involvement.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
I believe you meant to say
that you revealed it to him.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
Two traitors united.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
I'm even starting to think that
you have been in league with him

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
since the beginning of it all.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] That, I was not.
And I have proof.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
Or rather, a witness
to back my claim.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
[rustling]

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
Hello, Mother.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
Elizabeth?

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
The reason Buckinguhm
helped uncle Richard

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
is because I asked him to.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
And why would you do that?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
I overheard you gloating about
your "stunning performance"

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
and your plot for Richard!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
You made it impossible for me
to smile around him anymore!

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
Brother and uncle got
what they deserved

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
while you should be grateful
Buckingham forgave you!

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Such a wise
daughter is a treasure

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
greater than any other.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
I suggest you
withdraw to a convent.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
Stop your open
involvement in politics.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
That way, you spare Richard
a fairly dreadful decision.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
I'm to conclude I have no
choice in this matter, yes?

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
--[cracking]
--[BETH gasps]

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
I'll do as you wish,

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
as long as I get to take
the younger prince.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
If you can't allow me that,
I'll take my life here and now!

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
You don't want me
to die yet, do you?

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
There's no need for that.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
It will be done, Your Grace.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
I thank you all for letting
me celebrate with you.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
The vile Woodvilles are no more!

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
Hear, hear.
Let's drink to our king.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
To the king.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
Ah... This is the best my
wine's tasted in many a night!

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
Thank yourself for that.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
Had you not warned us, things
might've ended very differently.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
We've long been
comrades in arms,

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
I pray you think nothing of it.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
'Twas only natural.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
We can't relax our
guard just yet.

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
Not while that woman bears
the title of queen mother.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
Then why not send
somebody to watch her?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
Jane would be the perfect
candidate, would she not?

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
You mean your witch?

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
She's, uh, mine at
the moment, I suppose.

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
Having congress with a witch

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.111 position:50% align:center
seems to induce
superhuman pleasures.

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
Enough to pull the
spine right out of you.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
[HASTINGS]
Oh, no. Believe it or not,

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
she and I are bound by
simple feelings of love.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
Though I will admit its
beginning stages

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
were quite... stimulating.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
To prompt a closed bud
to blossom for you,

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
begin with a shock.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
Safe to assume Hastings's
support is solid.

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] No. The one who holds
his true loyalties is Edward.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
Why are you so upset?

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
Because I saw the way
you looked at me.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
What way? Ah, I see.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
You've only made
one payment thus far.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
It's going to take a
lot more than one time

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
to purchase my soul.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll undress myself.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Lord Richard.
Your left eye, is it injured?

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
My eyes are just strange.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
That's what the
servants' children said.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
Mother says the same thing.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
Why am I the only
one who's different?

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What I want is not love.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
What I need is a pact.

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
Now then. Do your worst.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
Before the wound
of our pact heals,

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
carve as much pain
as you want into me.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] My skin's a different
color from everyone else's.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
Is that strange?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Nuh-uh. Not one bit.

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Then it's fair to say
you're not strange either.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
You still don't
understand a thing.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
Mere pain fades away
exceedingly quickly.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
I told you. You will
sacrifice a self so secret,

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
even you don't know it yet.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
So, yes. I will mark you...

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll hide it with my hair.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
If you hide it,
you won't feel sadness.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
...with sweet suffering.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
I wonder if you can do as much?

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
What can I do?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Yes. It's better like this.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
The only one who knows the
true you, inside and out is me.

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Pleasure evolves
into pain sharp as thorns.

00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
Through this love-like act,
I'm killed and reborn.

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:13.083 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.418 position:50% align:center
Everyone here, listen close!

00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:18.505 position:50% align:center
King Henry the Sixth assumed the
throne at a young age as well,

00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:21.049 position:50% align:center
but was as weak as he
was mad and could not rule

00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:22.759 position:50% align:center
without his uncle's help.

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:26.471 position:50% align:center
Though I am not without talent,
there are traditions and rules.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:29.057 position:50% align:center
Yes. He was no king.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.684 position:50% align:center
Even when he reached adulthood,

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:32.894 position:50% align:center
he required a regent
to govern for him.

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:34.938 position:50% align:center
Our situation's much different.

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.357 position:50% align:center
Now, my lords. Do we all agree?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE E]
With Rivers gone,

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.568 position:50% align:center
how can we not go
along with this?

00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.070 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE F]
The only ones who'd say nay

00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:44.197 position:50% align:center
wouldn't be here in the palace.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.491 position:50% align:center
I hereby name
Richard of Gloucester

00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:49.452 position:50% align:center
as Lord Protector to
the country of England.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:52.080 position:50% align:center
'Tis an honor. I humbly accept.

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:01.548 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] The light my father
nearly attained in the past.

00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:04.592 position:50% align:center
It's there one moment
and gone the next.

00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:06.511 position:50% align:center
A lot has changed since then.

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:09.222 position:50% align:center
No longer are we powerless
children merely dreaming

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.558 position:50% align:center
of what the future holds.

00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:14.477 position:50% align:center
An immense mountain full
of thorns stood between us

00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:16.771 position:50% align:center
and the crown.

00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:19.441 position:50% align:center
We've certainly done a
fair amount of pruning.

00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:21.276 position:50% align:center
Only two remain.

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:24.154 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Now seize the rose!

00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:25.488 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I will.

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:29.951 position:50% align:center
Even if my hands should
become drenched in blood.
