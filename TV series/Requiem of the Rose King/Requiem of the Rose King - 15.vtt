00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
You said you'd free
me from this life!

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
I will grant you
what you desire.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
[MALE ROBBER A groans]

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What is this about?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Further conversation

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
with such garbage would
lower the worth of my soul.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
Will you slay me as well?

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
Rivers has devised a
plan to arrest you

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
in the morning on
suspicion of treachery.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
Needless to say, the Woodvilles
haven't the slightest intention

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
of sharing power with you.

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
What's more, this body
makes you hardly "worthy"

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
of wearing the crown.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why did you hide it from me?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Did you fear the knowledge
would make me despair?

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Did you fear to lose me?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lose you?

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
That's right. When we met,
I thought you a woman.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
And my imagination was correct.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Stop! I'm a man!

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Hmm. Indeed.
You are that as well.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
But has your "womanhood"
ever known love?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
All this time,

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
you've lived hiding
your true self.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
I can tell.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
We're two of a kind.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
If you offer up your
hidden self to me,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
here and now, then I would
become a demon's other half.

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
[MALE FOREST VOICE A]
Look at you.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center

Demon.

[MALE FOREST VOICE B]
All bloodstained flawed.

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE FOREST VOICE B]
Your very birth...

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICES]
...defied the will of God.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Richard, this is
your last chance.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
Will you seize what
you truly want,

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
or perish with nothing in hand?

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
The choice is all yours.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
--[BUCKINGHAM] Come.
--[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
Say it. What is
it that you desire?

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you want.
What you've always wanted!

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
I want...

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
Say it, Richard.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I want,
above all else, the crown!

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
Very well. Then I shall
put it in your hands.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] What I want is
for you to remember this pain.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
It's the seal of our covenant.

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
The pain of this sin
we commit together.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Despite my prayers
and wishful thinking,

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
the voices of my
curse never faded.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
If the lost warmth
I've foolishly clung to

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
all these years can
never be mine again.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
If it will let me
escape destiny...

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] ...then a dark,
blood-soaked demon I shall be.

prepared for you, Your Grace.

Please allow me
to help you dress.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center

are convinced I betrayed you

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
and are now their dog.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard!

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
Worry not, Catesby. I cared
for Richard last night.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center

Good morning, Earl Rivers.
I trust you slept well.

[ANTHONY] Too well! My plan to
ease Richard got me intoxicated!

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
So then, is everything
going as we planned?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY]
Once Richard's out of the way,

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
I'll be the mightiest
man in England!

As the king's proxy,
I command everyone here;

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
find and arrest
the arrant traitor!

in regard to that subject,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
I wanted to hurry to London

got arrested and held us up!

No! What did you say?

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty attended to their
sugared words for years,

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
but looked not on the poison

charge me with crimes

I did not commit.

You are safe now, Your Majesty.

Should any villain upset
the peace of this land,

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
I'll see that each and every one
of them is purged from it.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
Let us proceed to the palace.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] What in
God's name has happened?

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
No. This can't be.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Well done.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
You've freed the palace
of your enemies.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
What of Elizabeth?

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Is there the smallest
chance she still trusts you?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
I have any number of ways to
ensure that's indeed the case.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
She's even gone so far as to
dub me her "kingmaker."

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Hm? What's wrong?
Are you jealous?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
Just remember I called
you my kingmaker first.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
But I do still want
you to play her ally.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
We can use Elizabeth again.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
As you wish, my king.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Your Grace.
His Majesty is calling for you.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
Very well, then.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Developed a
hobby for spying, I see.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
Next time, I'll let you
watch the entire thing.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
I gave you fair warning,
Lord Buckingham.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
All who harm Lord Richard
must answer to me.

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
But if it's something he wants,

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
even if he knows that something
will only hurt him...

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
I've taken the role of
a demon's other half

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
