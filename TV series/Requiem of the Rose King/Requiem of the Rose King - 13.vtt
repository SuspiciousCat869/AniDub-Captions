not you, Hastings.

More importantly.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center

was this woman's dress,

I suppose you have.
But that destiny's not mine.

Then go choose a future
that does belong to you.

My future entails whatever
my king wants of me.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Are you referring
to the same king whose policies

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center

during the French campaign?

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
Mind your tongue.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
And then there's the matter
of Warwick's death.

the one who murdered him.

From the moment
I laid eyes on you,

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
I saw what was there,
lurking deep within your soul.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
The debauchery
beneath the beauty.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center

But, sire. I have a husband.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center

Why not try using a philter?

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
It's a miraculous elixir
that inspires sweet,

Have you ever slept
with a witch?

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center

What do witches do?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Fly and predict the future?

[JANE]
They can do many things,

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
and reading signs
is one of them.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
Like those "cakes of destiny,"
for example.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE ATTENDANT A] He spent
last night alone as well.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This body makes having a wife,

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
or even wishing
for a wife, a sin.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
So I thought.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
You're certain about this?
I needn't accompany you?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
If you did come,

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
you'd only end up
feeling poorly again.

You look as beautiful
as you always do!

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Flowers are gifts
you give to your mother.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
All right, Edward?

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm off.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
Let's go see your
father to the gate.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] He resembles that
man more every year.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
These loveless days
are my "reward," I fear.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
For each time Richard
speaks out Edward's name,

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
I feel he's scolding me,
like I'm to blame.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
So then, your wife won't
be joining you today?

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
The same as your wife.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
The difference is I embrace
her from day to day.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
You realize the soul and body
are separate matters.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's entirely plausible

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
God gave us flesh to punish us.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
After all, this body is
just a prison of my soul.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
That's why the death of
my soul brought me peace.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Without it, I cannot
be confined.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
Nothing can be taken from me.

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE laughs] The wine I drink
with my son is exceptional!

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
Disappears a lot quicker, too!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] I think you could
stand to drink a little less,

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
especially since I
heard you threw

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
some fairly wild
insults at the king.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
I didn't say anything untrue.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
Look, with my
"drink of destiny,"

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
I foresee that our house will be
reduced to impoverished nobles

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
by the time our son inherits it!

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
George, behave yourself!

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE grunts]
I'm so sorry.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
Everything I do turns out wrong.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
I'm completely hopeless.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
George, come here.
You are not hopeless.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
Think where you stand.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
Shoulder to shoulder
with the king.

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
Isabelle...

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
I know you hate him,

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
but you must not publicly
aggravate matters.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
Release your worries
and trust me.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
You betrayed my father,

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
and still I chose
to stand by you.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
I even sacrificed my own sister.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
[JANE] I've prepared what
Your Grace requested.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
And you're certain it will work?

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
[JANE]
But of course.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
However, every curse known to
man comes at some kind of price.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
That's fine.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] I could care less
who is crowned queen or king.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
What matters now is George,
my everything.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLES chattering]

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD V]
I did it!

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
[MALE ATTENDANT B]
Marvelous, Your Highness!

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
What a child. Getting excited
over dumb games. Grow up.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'm surprised George
didn't show his face.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
Truly, I'd be more surprised
if he were invited.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
Considering how appalling he
was at the last gathering.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
He was like that well before.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD V]
Father! Look what I got!

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] I see. I also
see nightfall is upon us.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
The three of you should
be asleep in your beds.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Oh, but I would still like to--

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
Take tonight to rest after these
eventful days of feasting.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
Would my presence
inconvenience you?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you were speaking?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
[MALE NOBLE A] So, the queen's
spell has been broken at last.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
[MALE NOBLE B]
A new witch must have appeared

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
and taken her place.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Yes. This is nothing unusual.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
But still, no matter how much
he favored his pets in the past,

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
he never disregarded me
the way he did tonight.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
It's all right.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
I no longer have need
of the king's affections.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
Mother, what's wrong?

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE RICHARD gasps]

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.673 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I already
hold the winning hand.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
My sons who will
ascend to the throne.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
Gather round gentleman,

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
for the remainder of the
night is ours to enjoy!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
[JANE chuckles]

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
That woman.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Your Grace.

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
I pray you drink until
your heart's content.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
My lords. I prepared
this miraculous wine

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
especially for tonight's feast!

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
Now, welcome to Elysium!

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLES chatter]

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Honestly. This is "Elysium?"

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
It likely is to
your brother, I suppose.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] If there is truly
paradise on this earth,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
I believed that golden
halo contained it.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
[YORK] Within that
circlet lies paradise.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]
What? My head is spinning.

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center

Richard.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]
Father?

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
Join us.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
Richard, this is paradise.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
You've found it, so have
your fill of pleasure.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
Relax your inhibitions
and set yourself free.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
Please stop. Stop this instant!

[FOREST VOICES]
Demon! Demon! Demon!

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I claimed my
soul perished that day,

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
yet it was so easily summoned
back to its hollow home.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
--What a feeble "death."
--[BUCKINGHAM] Richard!

[RICHARD gasps]

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
They're mad.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This place is no paradise.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
And that man.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
That man... is not my father.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]
Where am I?

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
What happened after the banquet?
Did someone... touch me?

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Your Grace.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Catesby.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] Please forgive
my impertinence, Lord Richard.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
The guests have dispersed.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
They seemed dazed.
Like last night was a blur.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
I owe you thanks.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] I wish I could
have warned you beforehand.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
Lord Hastings told me
His Majesty's lover,

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
a woman called Jane,
can compound a variety of drugs,

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
and the king has taken a
liking to her concoctions.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] It appears you're
more attuned to court gossip

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
than I am.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
Lord Hastings is a close
friend of the king's,

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
so I'm privy to
this knowledge, yes.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm in your debt.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
In regard to Henry,
when you confronted--

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.057 position:50% align:center
Speak not! It's over now!

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.144 position:50% align:center
It all came to
an end... that day.

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
So you want to talk?

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center
Then tell me more
about this Jane.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.735 position:50% align:center
This is merely a rumor but,
during an interlude

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
with King Edward, she claimed
she was a "witch."

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
A witch?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
Commonplace coupling is
simply bothersome now,

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
ever since I got a
taste of true divinity.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
Once's mine, that which shines
always loses its luster.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
Wish I could say it
was the first time

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
I experienced this bore.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
But Jane defies
that very principle.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
The more I have of her,
the more I want to take.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
She'll lead me from
this dull throne

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
to a glittering Elysium
that never fades.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
What's the matter,
Your Grace?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] I have felt my health
declining rapidly of late.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Particularly the day
after my pleasures.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
My king!

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
Oh, I merely need a bit of rest.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
Please, Hastings.
Go summon Jane for me.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
I'll regain my strength if I can
simply bask in her presence.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[HASTINGS]
Go and fetch Jane.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
I'll remain at His Majesty's
side and watch over him.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
Though I doubt it's serious,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
do not let the court
catch wind of this.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
Gossip aside, Her Majesty
does not need to know.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
I want to find out who
this Jane truly is.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] If she is a witch,
I'll kill her on the spot.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Look there.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
This is no festival.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Picture it vividly in your mind!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN C]
Then pray.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN D]
Yes, pray!

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN E]
Take your anger and resentment.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN F]
And cast it into the fire!

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Mm. What's this?

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
"Death to King Edward?" But why?

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
You're holding a cursed doll.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hm?

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
Who could've wished
death on His Majesty?

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
Such a treasonous act.

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Forgive me, Heavenly Father.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
What on earth is this illness

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
that struck her so suddenly?

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
[MALE ATTENDANT C]
Well, she never quite recovered

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
from childbirth.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
But it's been more than half
a year since she gave birth!

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
[MALE ATTENDANT C] I suspect
stress is another factor.

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
Isabelle, please! Hold on!

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
[JANE] Your Majesty,
I can venture a guess

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
at the cause of your ailment.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
And the identity of the
one who cursed you.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
My medicine... there...

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Isabelle.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
All I've ever done
is let you down.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
I'm truly sorry.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
But I swear to you,
I am a man reborn!

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
I will protect our house
and make it prosper!

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
Cursing the king of England
would be the gravest of crimes!

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
Who is it? Do you
know their identity?

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
Your Grace, the day you and
I met, you received a cake.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Red wine stands for blood,
and the capital G is an initial.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
No, it couldn't be!

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
Yes. Bloodstained George
is the culprit.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
We will always
be together, right?

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
I love you so much.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Did... you hear me?

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
No... Isabelle!

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
But, without any proof...

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Your Grace.
I have the proof here.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
So it's true!

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
There were three dolls
containing three slips of paper.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
The text on each one bore wishes
for the death of Your Majesty 

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
and the princes.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
Yes, but this is not
George's writing.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:17.157 position:50% align:center
Please, allow me to handle
this matter, this curse.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
I'll see what George knows
and get to the bottom of it.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
Just what is it that
you're after here?

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:27.083 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to frame my
brother for the sole purpose

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
of convincing me you
truly are a witch?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
Who knows? Time will tell.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
You won't escape
the eyes of doubt.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:38.470 position:50% align:center
Not after turning the royal
court into a den of vice.

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
You will burn like Joan of Arc.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
You believe the corruption
of the court to be my fault?

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
But what of the king?

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
Put his lust ahead of his
realm and forgot the fight.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
What of his sot of a
younger brother whose 

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
emotional outbursts make him the
House of York's Achilles' heel?

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
You know I'm right.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What's your point?

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
I've taken a keen
interest in you,

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
since you're so
unlike other men.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
Your heart promises
much more complexity.

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Know your place, whore!

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
Merely a jest.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
All that I desire is
enjoyment in my life.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
I have no objectives.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
Nobles are the ones who
seek meaning in everything.

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'll go on alone
from here, Catesby.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
My lord.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
If you swear allegiance to York,

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
conclude you know
nothing and then depart.

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
That witch, if we let her live,
she'll keep the queen in check.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
George is another story.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
He's become nothing but
poison for our house.

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
He's a severe threat to York.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'll arrest him.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
Why was I not asked to join?

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
I've been looking for you.

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
Then I happened to see you
set out with your man.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
Which means you overheard us?

00:20:58.216 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
However often you
deny what I see--

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lord Buckingham. Aid me.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Mm? Do you jest?

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
Before I consent, there is
something I must confirm.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
Is there anything you're
keeping hidden from me?

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
Swear you have no
secrets between us.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
If I am to be your other
half here, we reveal it all.

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
I swear it.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
Well in that case, Richard,

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
every dream you
have will be real.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
I will see to it, my king.

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
You've made a mistake
that I should correct.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
I am not the master
Catesby serves.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
You aren't?

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
Then why does he perform his
role so dutifully even now?

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
I am loyal to York.

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I will join
you in your quest.

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
If that's what you wish,

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
ready yourselves, for we are
tasked with eliminating those

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
who would do York ill
by any and all means.

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I've not seen my future.

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
But I've touched it.

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:02.697 position:50% align:center
And now I know what can be.

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:16.419 position:50% align:center line:10%
