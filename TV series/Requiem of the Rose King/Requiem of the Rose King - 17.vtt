[RICHARD] This man was
once the king's friend,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
my comrade in arms.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
Following the king's death,
he gave brotherly guidance

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:27.444 position:50% align:center
at times and strove
to sustain this land.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
However...

[STANLEY gasps]

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Those who would
sell their souls to demons

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
are hellbound.

[MALE YORKIST NOBLE A]
What is going on?

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
[HOWARD] Listen well! There was
a heinous, yet failed attempt

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
on the Duke of Gloucester's life
by the queen dowager's family,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
Lord Hastings,
and their supporters!

[BUCKINGHAM]
Lord Stanley.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
It appears you've backed
the wrong horse.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
What a horrid man.
Hastings was evil!

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
How could he spread baseless
slander against the duke?

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
He even attempted to
murder his lordship,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
and went so far as to use
sorcery as opposed to a sword!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
Yet have no fear!
The cur was executed

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
before our very eyes and
his schemes forestalled!

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
Praise be to God
for His justice,

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
and recognizing the good

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:17.786 position:50% align:center
[STANLEY] Our Lord Protector!
Please have mercy!

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.121 position:50% align:center
I swear to make amends
for the sake of this country

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.083 position:50% align:center
and serve you, body and soul!

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.751 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Very well.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50% align:center
Hear me: it is not yet
too late for any of you.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
If we can join hands
for our country's sake,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.594 position:50% align:center
We'll be as brothers.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50% align:center
This vow I shan't break.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'm drawing near
to the end of my fight 

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:44.688 position:50% align:center
and soon I'll be able
to grasp the light.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.198 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.951 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.791 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

[BUCKINGHAM]
Queen Dowager Elizabeth.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
What an utter disgrace.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
You tried so hard
only to falter.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
What ever do you mean?

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Don't play the fool.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
You wanted Gloucester dead,
and were ready to pay

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
any price necessary to
see that come to pass.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH gasps]

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
For he is the true
heir to the throne.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
Far more legitimate than either
of your wretched progeny,

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:02.659 position:50% align:center
and you knew that.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
Such blatant blasphemy!

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
Mister Catesby.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
Come forth and bring the
contemptible truth to light.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
The truth witnessed
on the battlefield.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
What I am about to say
is not without merit,

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
for a wealth of testimony
can support my claims.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50% align:center
I also swear to Our Heavenly
Father I speak nothing but fact.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
The previous monarch,
Edward the Fourth,

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
had fallen in love and married
another woman in holy matrimony

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50% align:center
long before he met
Elizabeth Woodville.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
Though she managed to
deceive us for years,

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
Elizabeth was never his
lawfully wedded wife.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
Therefore, her son, Edward,
is not a legitimate king.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
A very grievous error, indeed!

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
A twig of lowly stature has been
grafted onto the royal tree!

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
But gentlemen! That golden
circle has not yet been

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center

[BUCKINGHAM]
Take both of the brothers away!

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center

S-Stop it!

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD V]
Unhand me! This is unforgivable!

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
I am king!

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
Damn that demon to the
darkest pits of hell!

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
You'll pay for this, Richard!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
The moment we've waited
for has come at last.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
How you and I have toiled to
see the light of this day.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD
"You and I?" Hm.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
Once the time is upon us,

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
we'll no longer need to
reaffirm our pact as proof.

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] The king's body
belongs to the kingdom.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
Naturally, yes.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
Are Jane's words causing you
any concern, by chance?

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
What I don't know is, do you
truly understand yourself?

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
You can rest assured.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware of
the person I am.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
Do you have any
evidence of this?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
Or do you merely wish
to believe it were true?

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The terrible nights will return.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Even though I've already
come to know warmth.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's for the crown.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
Our covenant is nothing more
than a ritual to that end.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
You know that, Richard.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
It's to see if you're
worthy of being king.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
I also know... if you aren't
beside me, I can't sleep.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps] I, uh. Uh...!
Please forget that.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
You easily toy with my
resolve until it breaks.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.161 position:50% align:center
Coupling isn't the
extent of our pact.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
Tell me what it is you desire.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
Stay. I want you to be with me.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
Till the morning
sunlight burns away

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
every last patch of darkness.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT A]
Have you heard?

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
Edward the Fifth and
his brother were taken

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
to the Tower of London!

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT B]
But what crime did

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
those boys commit?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT C]
Who knows, but if it's true,

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
there's only one man the
next heir to the throne can be!

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] What's wrong?
In a state of disbelief?

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
Even when I thought I held it,

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
Light has always
turned to curses

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
when it enters my
outstretched hands.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
Well, the light is
real this time.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50% align:center
There isn't anyone left with the
power to snatch your crown away.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
All the briars were cut
so the rose can bloom.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
At this point,
you need only to wish.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
For whatever you want
to happen now shall be.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
[CECILY] Where is the
Duke of Gloucester?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT B]
Praying at the Tower of London,

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
last I heard.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT C]
Ignoring his wounds

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
and offering prayers
for his nephews.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
[CECILY] Fools! This is all
according to his script,

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
and they'll act it out
perfectly if nothing is done.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
It appears you all have
been led astray,

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
so allow me to inform you
of Richard's past offenses!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
He has killed friends
and brothers alike!

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
And now in the very place
he struck down a king,

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
he feigns innocence and
offers up false prayers!

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Henry the Sixth
died before this alter.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
And I was his killer.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
With his fading breath
he called me demon.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
[CECILY]
Richard is without compassion,

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
for he was never capable
of it to begin with!

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
Unlike you or I, that pitiless
creature was not fashioned

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
in God's holy image!

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT A]
There was that rumor

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
going around, right?
The one about his "true self?"

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT D]
I heard it, too.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
His own mother said so.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT E]
Not only her,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
everyone was saying it.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
How Gloucester's
actually a demon!

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
Take heed and do not
crown a demon king!

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
If that grave mistake is made,
our wondrous country of England 

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
will be plunged into an
endless abyss of ruin!

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center

Get that filth out of England!

His head deserves an axe,

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
not a crown!

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
Please, Lord Richard.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center

I'm ready when
you are, Buckingham.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
The script is complete.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Now, act the part.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Humans fret over
the curse of the dead.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
But a demon... does what
he wants instead.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Listen. This is all a ruse.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
No matter how I beg,
you must not budge.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
You are to simply spurn my
demands like a pure maiden.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
And remember, Richard.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
The role you're
playing... is "God."

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
Right. I shall give a
performance so devout

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
it will hoodwink
the Lord Himself.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
You all cry "demon,"

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
but what foolish ravings!

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
No demon would have
skin that glows

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
with the beauty of an angel!

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
For he is the true scion
of the Plantagenets!

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
Once Duke of Gloucester
and now King of England!

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
What awful arrogance!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
He may clothe himself in holy
white and play the saint,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
but there's no hiding the rot
beneath that usurper's flesh!

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
Look towards me,
and clench your jaw.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
Watch your tongue!
How dare you call me the king!

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
Though you weren't all wrong.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
I have desired the
crown for some time.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
But only to offer Prince Edward,

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
so I could devote myself
to my brother's heir!

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Your Majesty is mistaken!

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
This Edward, whom our
manners call "The Prince",

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center
more bitterly could
I expostulate!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Wanton Edward the
Fourth neglected war

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
and despoiled his
subjects' wives!

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
To base declension
and loathed bigamy,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
he conceived those boys
in his unlawful bed!

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
Such lies!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
Do not let this demon's tawdry
performance trick you!

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You may be my friend,

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
but I'll forgive no more
slights to my family!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
If speaking true is a crime,

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
then I await my punishment.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
But as far as I know,
no blade wielded by you

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
was ever used to strike down
someone who spoke the truth.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
And it's that same
tenderness of heart

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
that drives you to serve
your brother's children.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
So very kind and gentle,
you wish to give them

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
the exalted station and
happiness of kingship!

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
If you want to know of wishes,
I have only one.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
This world is shrouded in
darkness, so I seek a light.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
On bloody mornings.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.674 position:50% align:center
Troubled days.

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
And lonely nights.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
I wish for a powerful light to
illuminate our proper path.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
I wish for someone to be
that powerful light.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why not you?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
You are that someone.

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
Please Your Grace, become this
world's shining light.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
The scars from the last child
king's reign have yet to heal.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
The people suffered
among the chaos.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
And you yourself felt the
appalling pains of that era.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT I]
He's right.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
When a king with no real
power assumes the throne,

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
conflict is bound to follow.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT J] I can't
bear to see such madness again.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT K] I lost
my son during those wars.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT L]
Yes, and I my father.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
I lost my father as well.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
That pain cuts deep, for he
was everything that I had.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
This is all just an act!

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
Not even those
tears are sincere!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT M]
I don't know.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Looks real enough to me.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Although it was the
briefest of moments,

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
I felt an important bond
strengthen between us.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Preserve the king's name.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I will, Father.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM grunts]

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard, look out!

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
If you still refuse to listen
to all of the entreaties

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
that I've made, to the
disgrace of your house,

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
I will plant another
bloodline on the throne!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT N]
Stop!

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center

Don't let there be another war!

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center

I beseech you, Your Grace!

You lot beg him, too!

Don't let our pleas be in vain!

[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT S]
For the sake of this England,

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
become king!

O Lord, please!

All of you!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Even if it means denying
justice and my soul,

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
I won't allow this great
nation to be destroyed.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
Buckingham, people of London,
I will become your shield.

Your king.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
The weight of destiny, is a
burden my body can bear!

Thank heavens!

[RICHARD] I, Richard,
bearer of my father's name,

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center

God's blessing to our new king!

What's the fuss?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
Sounds like they're holding
some kind of festival.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
[TYRRELL] They are. It's the
coronation of the new king.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Then Edward the Fifth's
coronation is today?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
Which means the rule of
Richard has come to an end!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
Yes, it won't be much longer

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center

sweet air of freedom!

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
O little robin,

Long may he reign!

a whirlwind laid trees low.

The night owl screeched.

All birds let out a crow to
herald in an age of misfortune.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
For I was born a
demon rife with sin.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Say, Father.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Why is it that
everyone does exactly

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
what the king tells them to do?

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Well, you see, that's because
the king is chosen by God.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Being chosen
by God sounds nice.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Do you think I'd ever be sad
again if He chose me as king?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
[YORK] How could you be?
You would have your every wish.

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Listen, Richard. Within that
circlet lies paradise.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
It holds every joy and blessing
the poets have dreamt.

Allow me to prophesy.

even as they lament the
loved ones they lost.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
Because God has chosen.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This bloody demon.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
Because both my heavenly
and earthly fathers

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
wanted this for me.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Almighty, all-knowing master!

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
I beg your permission to
create a heaven on earth

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
where I now stand!

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR A] I am God!
The King of Kings!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR B]
O dear Lord!

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
Our undying loyalty
is to you alone!

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I thought this play
was selected to please Edward

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
when he was to be king.
So why this subject?

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR A]
Listen well, angels!

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
While I am away, you must not
set a finger on my throne!

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
I know God commanded
us not to touch it,

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
yet I can't help but
wonder if I sat there

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
would I gain power equal to His?

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
My own light seats me
second only to God

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
so of course I'm curious.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
Could I, Lucifer,
match our Anointed King?

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
Your light is many
times brighter

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
and more beautiful than that
of God's shining brilliance!

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
Why, you must sit upon His
throne at once, Lord Lucifer!

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
All Heaven belongs to you
and me, your faithful advisor!

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
Behold! God's power is now
ours to do with as we please!

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
Pay your respects and kneel
before your true sovereign!

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
How dare they persist
with such mockery.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
Halt! Cease this
<i>lÃ¨se-majestÃ©</i> immediately!

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
Leave them be, Northumberland,
and take your seat.

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.213 position:50% align:center
[NORTHUMBERLAND]
But, Your Majesty!

00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
Carry on with the show.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR A]
What folly!

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
Plummet into Hell and be
bound there forevermore!

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
I've been robbed of God's
love and paradise!

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
I envy humans who have
the Lord's holy affection!

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Yes. This is indeed "Richard".

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
Or at least it was.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.655 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] A splendid diversion.
Please accept your reward.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
Catesby. Show them the
finest hospitality.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You, good sir,

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
are invited to tomorrow's
banquet as well.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
You will see your play's
sequel firsthand.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] But this time,
it will be in Richard's world.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Change everything
about tomorrow's festivities.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
Make sure no one could mistake
the gathering for Edward's.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
My celebration will demonstrate
that a new age as come.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
The age of Richard!

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
You're still awake?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
I promise to hurry off
to bed after this, Mother.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
All I wanted to do was bid
you and Father goodnight.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
Your Royal Highness.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM gasps]

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] I have not had
the leisure to properly

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
introduce myself,
and for that I apologize.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
I am deeply moved to see
that you have grown

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
into a fine young man.
I pray you're well.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm honored by
such high praise.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, m'lord.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Buckingham.
May I have a moment?

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
I'll be brief.

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Tonight, I'll share
my bed with Anne.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
I am the king, and spending
nights with my queen

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
is now a duty of mine.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Do you mind?

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
Why would I mind?
Our pact has been fulfilled.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
I've only one desire
for you now.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
You must be a perfect king.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
So these are the
royal apartments.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Care for a drink?

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
Nothing. I'm sorry.
Suppose I'm nervous.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
Even though you and I have
been married for so long,

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
I've never been
in your chambers.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Get used to it.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
You should as well.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] If only we could've been
together like this all the time,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
the way I dreamed
of back then.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Perhaps, this is
the beginning for us.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's too late, yet even so...

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] The queen is
the king's other half.

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
We have to support
each other to survive.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.208 position:50% align:center
Are these bandages
from an injury?

00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]
What's wrong?

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
I, um. Forgive me.
Fatigue rears its head.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
I should get some sleep.

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Very well.

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Am I drunk
on my newfound light?

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
When I can't hide in
the glow of the crown,

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
I am nothing more than
the demon, Richard.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
Has obtaining my goal made
everything more frightening?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
Because now I have known,
the warmth of acceptance.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] In this vast,
hazy world of uncertainties,

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
the path which my
spirit revealed to me

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
was endlessly clear and bright.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
I created a king,
my ideal king at that!

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
..burning passion
overcame my soul.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR A] Whew! I was
scared stiff tonight.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR C] I told you it was
a bad idea right from the start.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
Well, we're lucky
King Richard turned out

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
to be the forgiving sort.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR A]
Yeah.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
But a king's mood changes like
the wind, so we best be careful.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
We should make ourselves scarce
before we're hanged by our--

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR A groans]

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND] I can smile.
And also murder whiles I smile.

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
And cry the gratifying word
"Content" to that which grieves

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center
my heart, and wet my cheeks with
a deluge of artificial tears.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
I'll deceive more slyly
than Ulysses could,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.345 position:50% align:center
as well as slay more gazers
than the basilisk ever would.

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.180 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR C]
What?

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND] Can I do this and
cannot get a crown? Huh?

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.102 position:50% align:center
[MALE ACTOR C groans]

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:54.939 position:50% align:center
Tut were such a thing
any farther off than that.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.941 position:50% align:center
I'll pluck it down.

00:21:57.025 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
