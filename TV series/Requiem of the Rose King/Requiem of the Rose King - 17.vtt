you are, Buckingham.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
The script is complete.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Now, act the part.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Humans fret over
the curse of the dead.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
But a demon... does what
he wants instead.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Listen. This is all a ruse.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
No matter how I beg,
you must not budge.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
You are to simply spurn my
demands like a pure maiden.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
And remember, Richard.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
The role you're
playing... is "God."

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
Right. I shall give a
performance so devout

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
it will hoodwink
the Lord Himself.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
You all cry "demon,"

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
but what foolish ravings!

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
No demon would have
skin that glows

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
with the beauty of an angel!

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
For he is the true scion
of the Plantagenets!

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
Once Duke of Gloucester
and now King of England!

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
What awful arrogance!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
He may clothe himself in holy
white and play the saint,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
but there's no hiding the rot
beneath that usurper's flesh!

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
Look towards me,
and clench your jaw.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
Watch your tongue!
How dare you call me the king!

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
Though you weren't all wrong.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
I have desired the
crown for some time.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
But only to offer Prince Edward,

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
so I could devote myself
to my brother's heir!

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Your Majesty is mistaken!

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
This Edward, whom our
manners call "The Prince",

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center
more bitterly could
I expostulate!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Wanton Edward the
Fourth neglected war

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
and despoiled his
subjects' wives!

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
To base declension
and loathed bigamy,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
he conceived those boys
in his unlawful bed!

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
Such lies!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
Do not let this demon's tawdry
performance trick you!

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.015 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You may be my friend,

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
but I'll forgive no more
slights to my family!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
If speaking true is a crime,

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
then I await my punishment.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
But as far as I know,
no blade wielded by you

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
was ever used to strike down
someone who spoke the truth.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
And it's that same
tenderness of heart

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
that drives you to serve
your brother's children.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
So very kind and gentle,
you wish to give them

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
the exalted station and
happiness of kingship!

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
If you want to know of wishes,
I have only one.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
This world is shrouded in
darkness, so I seek a light.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
On bloody mornings.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.674 position:50% align:center
Troubled days.

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
And lonely nights.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
I wish for a powerful light to
illuminate our proper path.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
I wish for someone to be
that powerful light.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why not you?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
You are that someone.

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
Please Your Grace, become this
world's shining light.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
The scars from the last child
king's reign have yet to heal.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
The people suffered
among the chaos.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
And you yourself felt the
appalling pains of that era.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT I]
He's right.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
When a king with no real
power assumes the throne,

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
conflict is bound to follow.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT J] I can't
bear to see such madness again.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT K] I lost
my son during those wars.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT L]
Yes, and I my father.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
I lost my father as well.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
That pain cuts deep, for he
was everything that I had.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
This is all just an act!

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
Not even those
tears are sincere!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT M]
I don't know.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Looks real enough to me.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Although it was the
briefest of moments,

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
I felt an important bond
strengthen between us.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Preserve the king's name.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I will, Father.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM grunts]

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard, look out!

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
If you still refuse to listen
to all of the entreaties

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
that I've made, to the
disgrace of your house,

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
I will plant another
bloodline on the throne!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT N]
Stop!

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center

Don't let there be another war!

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center

I beseech you, Your Grace!

You lot beg him, too!

Don't let our pleas be in vain!

[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT S]
For the sake of this England,

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
become king!

O Lord, please!

All of you!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Even if it means denying
justice and my soul,

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
I won't allow this great
nation to be destroyed.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
Buckingham, people of London,
I will become your shield.

Your king.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
The weight of destiny, is a
burden my body can bear!

Thank heavens!

[RICHARD] I, Richard,
bearer of my father's name,

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center

God's blessing to our new king!

What's the fuss?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
Sounds like they're holding
some kind of festival.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
[TYRRELL] They are. It's the
coronation of the new king.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Then Edward the Fifth's
coronation is today?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
Which means the rule of
Richard has come to an end!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
Yes, it won't be much longer

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center

sweet air of freedom!

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
O little robin,

Long may he reign!

a whirlwind laid trees low.

The night owl screeched.

All birds let out a crow to
herald in an age of misfortune.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
For I was born a
demon rife with sin.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Say, Father.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Why is it that
everyone does exactly

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
what the king tells them to do?

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Well, you see, that's because
the king is chosen by God.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Being chosen
by God sounds nice.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Do you think I'd ever be sad
again if He chose me as king?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
[YORK] How could you be?
You would have your every wish.

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Listen, Richard. Within that
circlet lies paradise.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
It holds every joy and blessing
the poets have dreamt.

Allow me to prophesy.

even as they lament the
loved ones they lost.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
Because God has chosen.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This bloody demon.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
Because both my heavenly
and earthly fathers

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
wanted this for me.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center

[RICHARD] I thought this play
was selected to please Edward

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center

You will see your play's
sequel firsthand.

it will be in Richard's world.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Change everything
about tomorrow's festivities.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
Make sure no one could mistake
the gathering for Edward's.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
My celebration will demonstrate
that a new age as come.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
The age of Richard!

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
You're still awake?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
I promise to hurry off
to bed after this, Mother.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
All I wanted to do was bid
you and Father goodnight.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] I have not had
the leisure to properly

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
introduce myself,
and for that I apologize.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
I am deeply moved to see
that you have grown

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
into a fine young man.
I pray you're well.

Oh, I'm honored by
such high praise.

May I have a moment?

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
I'll be brief.

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Tonight, I'll share
my bed with Anne.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
I am the king, and spending
nights with my queen

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
is now a duty of mine.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

Do you mind?

Why would I mind?
Our pact has been fulfilled.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
I've only one desire
for you now.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center

What's wrong?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
Nothing. I'm sorry.
Suppose I'm nervous.

Even though you and I have
been married for so long,

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center

in your chambers.

You should as well.

[ANNE] If only we could've been
together like this all the time,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
the way I dreamed
of back then.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center

the beginning for us.

It's too late, yet even so...

the king's other half.

on my newfound light?

the glow of the crown,

the demon, Richard.

everything more frightening?
