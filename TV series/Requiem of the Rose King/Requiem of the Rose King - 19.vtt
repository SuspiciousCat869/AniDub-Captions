00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
as a cat strutting
around the palace?

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
So much charm in one little boy.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
I stole a dance

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
from that sweet kitten!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
Oh? Then you must've
gotten a look at his face.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
And what a face it is since
it belongs to His Majesty's

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
only child!

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
You know, he did resemble

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
the queen quite a bit.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
He scarcely comes to London,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
so no one recognizes him when
he does pay the capital a visit.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND] His Grace
probably wants to hide him.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
After all, it's obvious the boy
looks nothing like the king.

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM gasps]
Ow, that hurt!

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
I'm terribly sorry.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM sighs]

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Prince Edward?

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] I hear
that Father's great at fighting.

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
He loves it.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] I'm awful
at it, and even if I weren't,

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
I like books much
more than swords.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
In a world of war, your father
was forced to take up arms.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
Is something bothering you,
Your Highness?

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] I was told
I don't look like my father.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
I don't act like him either.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
They say... They say
I'm not his son.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Edward.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Huh?

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Father!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Tell me more about this.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Well, the first time was
at the masquerade.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
I was only startled
by the accusation.

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
But then the morning after came.

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST NOBLE A]
It must be true,

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
see how light his hair is?

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE A] That boy
hasn't a drop of royal blood.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE B]
So a cuckoo's child

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
caused their estrangement.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM whimpers]

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Everyone was whispering

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
such strange things
when they saw me.

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE C]
They've never been

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
an affectionate couple.

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
But that's not all, right?

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
There's an important rumor
you're overlooking.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
You're a "demon."

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
That's what the townspeople
kept telling me.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
Though I wanted to argue,
I didn't know what to say.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
They made me so mad, but I was
too frightened to give a reply.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
I hate what a weakling I am.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm going
to get stronger!

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
For the briefest moment,

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
I imagined this child
turning his back on me

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
the way my mother did.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
It's such a pretty place when
the flowers are in bloom.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
You've a real appreciation
for this garden.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
When I was your age,

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
I never once took the
time to admire a flower.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Hm?

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] The white rose
was an oath of vengeance.

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
The red, proof of blood spilled.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
These days, though, all they
symbolize is loveliness.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I needn't seek
a deeper meaning,

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
they're simply there existing.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] And before I knew it,
I found them dear to me.

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
Edward. You've seen your
grandfather's portrait.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
Though we didn't look alike,

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
no one shared a bond
stronger than we two.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Pity? Hypocrisy?

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
What is this feeling
I can't place?

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] Beautiful,
dashing, and kindhearted, too.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
Father!

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] My light!
I'd be lost without you!

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I may not know
the true nature of love,

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
but I am certain
that I feel it now.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
Edward, you are my son.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
My love for you simply exists.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
Well, Buckingham.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
I trust you know
why I summoned you.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Yes.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
Because of the petty rumor
plaguing the palace, I assume.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
Though it's been
buried a few times,

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
it always revives somehow,
like a ghost with a grudge.

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
And such rumors are
deadly to a king.

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
Edward is quite upset
with them as well.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
I sense something deliberate

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
behind the spread
of this gossip.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
I'll take measures at once,
as should you, sire.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What measures?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] The threat keeps
reviving because we haven't

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
cut it off at the root.

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
Even finding the
culprit won't kill it.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
Proof that could
counter these claims.

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
That's what you need to
dispel the rumors for good.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
And the most undeniable evidence

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
would be for the queen
to bear your child.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Your Grace,
I speak as your loyal retainer

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
and friend.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Yes, I know.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
But what if she rejects
me when I ask her?

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
And she sees this
revolting body?

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
She won't.

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Her Majesty is aware of her duty
as queen. She's quite wise--

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] She doesn't know me.
For years, I kept her away.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
From what?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
From everything about me.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
I don't follow you.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
Not once have Anne and
I attempted to make love.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
Edward is not my son by blood.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
You made me an oath.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
Swore to keep no secrets.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
Buckingham, please.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.219 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Disinherit him.

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
We'll be caught in our own trap.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly not
recall what we said

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
to convict the previous king?

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
You must cast him aside
if he is not of your blood--

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
His blood is pure.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
He is the child of
King Henry's son.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
The spawn of the
Lancastrian prince?

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
If this boy is not your own,

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
and also carries the blood
of your sworn enemies,

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
then even your brother's sons
would be a better fit than him!

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
This situation isn't
merely a distant memory!

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
It poses a great danger, and I'm
not certain you understand that,

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
or how Richard the Third
will suffer the most from it!

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I will protect Edward.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
That child...
That child is my son.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
I knew something was wrong.

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] But despite
my suspicions, I trusted you.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
Henry...

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why? Dear God, why?

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
He's the child of
King Henry's son?

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
Don't succumb to emotion.

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
Think what you ought to do,
every problem has a solution.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting, Henry.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
Of all the places, why here?

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
Frankly, I haven't the time
to indulge you, so begone!

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
Quickly!

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[TYRRELL]
No. You promised me.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Go! Return to your sheep,
where you belong!

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
[TYRRELL] I won't leave.
Not until you teach me.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
I want to learn how
I can love people.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
The way you love that person,
and he loves you in return.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.735 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Why would you want to know love?

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
Once you do, you can
never go back.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
Even if you lose it.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
I thought I need only cut
a path through the thorns.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.246 position:50% align:center
I feared naught even
during a war, but no more.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
In truth, my feelings
are distracting me

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
at this very moment.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Richard, why?

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
For what purpose did
I give up on you?

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM gasps]
Explain yourself!

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:36.097 position:50% align:center
I wished to stop
your falling tears.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
Well, save your sympathy for
a weakling who needs it!

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
My aim is to help all
people in misery.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
Those who are content
do not seek my salvation.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
That's right. And you came here
by choice, I didn't ask for you!

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
But what of Richard?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
He said he'd protect
the Lancastrian boy.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
The blood of Henry the Sixth!

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
Does he truly think
Edward's sons are better?

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
How can that be?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
He swore to shoulder
my past and darkness.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to be the
two halves of one whole.

--[gasps]
--[glass breaks]

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What if...

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
What if he never
returns to my side?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What if I've lost him?

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
That's impossible. Calm down.
Everything's fine.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
We merely had a
little disagreement.

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
We'll resolve it soon enough,
he left to take measures.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
Yes. He's my other half,
so given some time--

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
--[door opens]
--[RICHARD gasps] Buckingham!

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but it's only me.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anne.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
My ladies have a request.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
May there be
acrobatics at dinner?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
T'would please the court.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
I'll even summon the
jesters for you.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
Very well. I don't mind.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?
Seems like you've taken ill.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
As eye-catching as
you were in that dress,

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
I lost sight of you
through the banquet.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
I take it you spent the
remainder of the night drinking?

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
You were truly beautiful.
Even more so than many a maiden.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
Well, then. I'll see to
the dinner arrangements.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Edward will
also enjoy the jesters.

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I left too soon.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
I meant to ask who the devil
that abducted the beauty was.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] But that look on
Richard's face said it all.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] What am I doing?
I can't lose my head over this!

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
Everything I've longed for
is right here, right now.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM giggles]

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
Catesby. Why hasn't
Buckingham joined us?

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
He's entertaining a guest.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
He'll be dining with them in his
private chambers this evening.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hm... I see.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
If it's all right, I have a big
favor to ask of you, Father.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
Oh? What is it?

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
About Beth. I would like to
invite her back to the palace.

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Disinherit him.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
Beth and I got to dance together
the night of the masked ball.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
She could've lit up the room
with how her face glowed.

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] He wants me to
abandon this child? Absurd.

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
I don't care how sharp the
thorns that bar my path are,

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
there must be another way.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
Right, Henry? This crown was
worthwhile because of you.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
But even this golden halo
can't prevent the ceaseless

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
unease and fear from
crawling out of the shadows,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
and forming a dark pool
of doubt in my heart.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Father?

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
You have my blessing
to do as you please.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Do you really mean it?

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Pay me no mind.
I'll return shortly.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.003 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]

00:20:56.506 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Henry, why aren't
you here with me? Hurry back!

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE RICHARD sighs] Dancing
jesters and a feast of far more

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
than could ever be eaten.
Must be nice to be king!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
Well, not the former king,

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
since he's just a bookworm
stuck in a barn.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
Why not silence yourself and
have another dream of Mother,

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
you illiterate idiot?

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
"Mother, I miss you!
Please save me!

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
Let me rub my face
all over your chest!"

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
I only said that once
and it was in my sleep,

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
so quit harping on it, Edward!

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE RICHARD] Worthless fool
just happened to be born first!

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
Being trapped in here
with him is hell.

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.466 position:50% align:center
Help me, mother.

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD V] When are we going to
get out of this miserable tower?

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:45.221 position:50% align:center
Damn you, Richard, you better
not leave us here to rot!
