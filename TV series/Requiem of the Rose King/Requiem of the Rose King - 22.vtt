[YORKIST ATTENDANT D]
Your Grace!

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT D] Punish the
rebels with force of arms,

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.224 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your Majesty!
Before it's too late!

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:18.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
Calm yourselves! Is it certain
that the Duke of Buckingham

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
is the one leading
the rebellion?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
We can't afford mistakes here!

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT E]
The rebels declared it to be so,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the duke has yet to
deny their assertions!

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT F] What's
more, there's also word that

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
Buckingham now holds the Earl
of Richmond as his new king!

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT G]
The Earl of Richmond?

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
Does that upstart even have
any claim to the throne?

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT F] He comes
from the Lancastrian royal line.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center line:84%
And Buckingham calls him king?

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
How could he?

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's been my kingmaker
all this time.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
Your Majesty.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
If His Grace has joined
with Lancaster,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
the boys in the Tower may
have disappeared for good.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Catesby's assumption is valid.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
And should Richmond be serious
in his attempt for the throne,

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
the next thorn on the rose
they'll aim to cut is...

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
It's been weeks.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
He's had more than enough
time to give me his answer.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
If Richard can't eliminate
the briars himself,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
there's only one path.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just as I did then.
I will take action.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:22.248 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Were my crown not
keeping me firmly in place,

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
I might've run to you the
moment I received your letter.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I might've given up everything

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
without a second thought.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, if I release my grip now...

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
[giggles]

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT D]
Please, sire!

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT E]
You must act!

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:46.731 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will... Assemble our
finest troops at once!

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center line:84%
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center line:84%
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:15.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
â™ª

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
My king.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Yes, I am king.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] There was a time,
however brief,

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
I could have thrown it
all away, but not now.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
God will pass judgment
on me, as He must.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
For spurning my oath
of blood, love, and trust.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you certain of this?
You've no doubts?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Tell me,
was there any other way?

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you saying I shouldn't
have become king?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or, perhaps, lying with him
was the root of the trouble.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or that the real issue
is I'm a demon.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's not it, Grace.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's useless to
ponder anyway, right?

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Henry wouldn't
waste time on such a plight.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because I had him,
I obtained the light.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
I seized what I wanted
and held on tight.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] But with past actions
through taking their toll,

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
the curse of this body
won't rule my soul.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Catesby.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center line:84%
You are to ride to London
straightaway and fetch Jane.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's no doubt being punished,
so go swiftly.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Northumberland.
You are well met.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Your Majesty!

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm a knight as well!
My sword and shield are yours!

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
Edward, you...

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I'm finally old enough
to fight with you!

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] War means you are
tasked with killing others.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
Soldiers may die even
before they get the chance

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center line:84%
to draw their weapons.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
Battle is pointless and brutal.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yet honor demands stifling
whatever feelings you have

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center line:84%
to mire the reek
of mud and blood.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can you do all that?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Leading him
into the hell that is war

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
is one sin I won't commit.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
This child is far too
kind for such horrors.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
But Father.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know you're in pain
because of this.

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center line:84%
So please, allow me to join you!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM gasps]

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
'Tis the king's duty to fight.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even against his
family and friends.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
When they turn on him.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM whimpers]

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE coughs]

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE] Richard, I know not
what transpired between

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
you and Buckingham,
but I believe in you.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
Both as a father, and as a king.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, we shall
march southwest.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our target is the
main rebel army force!

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
Advance with all haste!

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I shall return to you anon.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
Until then, I trust you'll
protect your mother.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
We'll proceed as planned.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] These days of
rain have put us far behind.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
We haven't the time to go
around if we're to reach

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
London ahead of him,
which of course means...

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's only one
route we can take.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've no choice but to ride past
the place we were to meet.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NORTHUMBERLAND]
Your Majesty, our scouts report

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
that Buckingham has
already left his castle.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though his destination
unfortunately remains unknown,

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
he can't be moving quickly
in this downpour,

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center line:84%
wherever he's headed.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
The woods.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center line:84%
That may be. Fording the
Severn River to reach London,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
he'd have to pass through
the Forest of Dean.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought Henry
and I had already

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
parted ways for good, and yet...

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
Give out the order
to everyone here!

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
We make for the forest of Dean!

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I may no longer
know my other half's heart,

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I know his mind.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
Somewhere amongst those trees,
he's waiting for me.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] If we cut through
the woods and cross the river,

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
the capital is
as good as ours!

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I could care
less if my body falls to earth

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center line:84%
or my name is dragged
through the filthiest mud,

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will end the kingdom, our
kingdom, with my own two hands.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Where are you, Buckingham?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
This encounter will mark the
end of it all, and yet I...

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER A] It's just
as you predicted, sire!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
The enemy has been spotted here!

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I can feel my blood
freeze over and flow backwards,

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
crying out for the
heat it once knew.

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER A]
Your Majesty!

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] The fire you stoked in
me scorched my curse to ash.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
The flames grew so powerful,
not even rain could quell them.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
My soul burns with longing
for that inferno,

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
regardless if it diminishes
everything around us.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
My very self is divided,

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
and half of it wails
with desire for you!

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
Buckingham, I cannot allow
you to reach the capital!

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] No salutation,
just right to the point.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that your answer, then?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
If that's the case,

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll have to slay Richard
the Third here and now.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your Grace, please leave
that traitor to us, sire!

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
Stay back! Buckingham is mine!
I'll settle this!

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Come, Richard!

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center line:84%
Face me! You can't
run away forever!

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Buckingham!

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Don't you mean to kill me?

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go on. Raise your sword.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Those eyes,
searing hot like molten gold.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
I cherish the moments they
reflect nothing but me.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] For that's when
I feel supreme happiness.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
That spark of bliss
lights my soul ablaze.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD grunts]

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps, grunts]

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM grunts]

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
[whimpers]

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard. Never did I
dream of killing you.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Then why in God's name--

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] But there's a
part of you that must die!

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
King Richard the Third must die!

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
We haven't run out of time.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, this weather has
made it even more plausible

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
for both of us to vanish here.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
A little evidence left
behind would convince

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
the most dubious skeptic
that King Richard and

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Duke of Buckingham drowned
in the overflowing river,

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center line:84%
still locked in combat as
they fell to their deaths.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] That's why you led me
so far away from our troops.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] We'll go abroad
and forsake our names.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll stay at your side,

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
clearing briars from your
path as long as I live.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
Including the deep
loyalty to your father

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
that continues to bind you.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Loyalty to my father?

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Yes. Your longing for the crown

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center line:84%
must have its roots in
your father's ambition.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
It only makes sense with
how devoted to him you are.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was possessing
that golden circlet

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
truly a wish of your own making?

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Honestly.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
I often found myself wondering,
if my light lay elsewhere.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I only sought such salvation
because I had lost all hope.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Buckingham.
You showed me the truth.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center line:84%
Opened my eyes.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
The king's light is now mine,
so I finally understand.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
My father's spirit is
no briar by any means.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center line:84%
The wishes he had, his memories,
even his suffering,

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
they're all a part of me.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's why they are briars.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
Edward. My wife, Anne.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everyone is a thorn to you.
England and yourself as well.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because of that, I fear
I cannot go with you.

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM gasps]

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] But you can still
grant one last wish I have!

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Get on a boat, and flee!

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
You mean the boat you and I

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
were supposed to take together?

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
Escape to a world
without you in it?

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
What conceivable worth
would such a place have?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
It's not perfect,

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
but it's the best we
can do at this point.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we live, we have a future.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
No matter where you go,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
I promise to find you
and follow after.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
Until I do, I'll think of
this ring, the way I do you.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD, BUCKINGHAM gasp]

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] Instead of a piece
of jewelry, a mere trinket,

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wish I could sear this
kiss into your hand!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
A mark to serve as a
reminder of these lips,

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
which will always call
your name with love.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
From this moment
till forevermore.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Please, speak not
another word.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
Save them for your
pen and write me.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NORTHUMBERLAND]
Your Majesty!

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Take this ring
that bears the royal crest.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you find yourself in a tight
spot, it should be useful.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now go!

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Richard.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
There you are!

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
The riverbanks collapsed,
we all need to fall back!

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
The flood dispersed our foes.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
They won't be able
to run far, though.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
It's fading.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
These cruel, icy drops
of rain are robbing me

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the last vestiges of warmth.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's almost as though
that comforting sensation,

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
were an illusion from
the very beginning.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER A] My lord!
I'm relieved you're unharmed!

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let us retreat to a
friendly manor for shelter

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
and await the Earl of
Richmond's reinforcements!

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll fetch you a horse!

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
Richmond won't come.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
He and his men are stuck
in a storm as well.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's a good chance those
soldiers would sell you out

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
if they learned
of his delay.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wouldn't care if
they did, I'd gladly go.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] Richard. You refer
to me as your other half.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
But you aren't a mere portion.
To me, you are everything.

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Tyrrell, take this.

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
I do not need it.
Not anymore.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I've only
one final duty to fulfill.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is the king stationed here?
I caught wind he was.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER B]
Why, Sir Catesby!

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:04.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm back from London.
Inform His Majesty.

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER C]
Make way!

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER D]
Hey, isn't that?

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY gasps]

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
Lord Buckingham?

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
How?

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER E] The duke
seems to have resigned himself

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
to his fate.

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center line:84%
His supposed "comrades"
found he was more valuable

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a bargaining chip
than a commander.

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] No. He should
have been able to escape.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was... the plan.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center line:84%
Behead the traitors who
would give up their leader

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
for a measly reward.

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER E]
The treatment Buckingham

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
received is what he deserved!

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIER F] Death is the
only punishment for treason!

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] That's right. I've
slaughtered countless enemies,

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
some for even lesser crimes.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
A valid point.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center line:84%
Traitors must be cut
down with no exceptions.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Why, Henry?
Why did you come back?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center line:84%
[door opens]

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
So this is how it ends?
The outcome the king hoped for?

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
Protect him.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
Watch over Richard as you always
have, for I've another role.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's the end.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
What role do you speak of?

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
Betraying him and
being executed?

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I wanted to attain
something at any cost.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ever since childhood.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
And at long last,
we seized those dreams.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
But once we had the
things we sought,

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
I realized we'd been
looking at different lights.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shouldn't have to tell
you how determined I am.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
I take what I want by any means.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
I know that well.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
And your "means" drew out his
secret desires while callously 

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center line:84%
leading him down a
path of corruption!

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
The sins you bear are
beyond forgiveness.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] True. And I won't
change as long as I live.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll want Richard completely.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll want him to want me,
as long as I draw breath.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you know your faults,

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
live on and atone for your
wrong doings, you coward!

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
Charlatan! Don't act the saint.

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know you'd commit
any heinous crime

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
for Richard's sake, as well.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
I also know I'll surely
kill him if left unchecked.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] Even so. I believe
your death can be avoided,

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
and therefore should be.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is that, Sir Catesby?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you think I intend to use my
passing so I can mentally wound 

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard or something
of the like,

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
then you are sorely mistaken.

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
My role, you see, is the
opposite of causing him harm.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
I clear the thorns
away from his path.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
Every thorn there is.
Even if I, myself, am one.

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] I doubt I'll
ever be able to agree

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
with your way of thinking.
Too twisted to navigate.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] Before I go, do you
have any last requests?

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] The sooner you
execute me, the better.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center line:84%
A prolonged prison stay will
leave me dingy and haggard,

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
which won't do.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd much prefer to look
my best for Richard.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then I'll inform him.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
Catesby! Please relay
one more thing.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Stop, I've heard enough.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
But, sire--

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] You're not to
say anything further!

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center line:84%
'Tis Buckingham's final wish.
He desires to see you once more.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center line:84%
You can't grant him that?

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Seeing him
will blunt my resolve.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Incompatible desires
threaten to burst from my heart

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
and tear my soul to pieces.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, Your Grace.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I'd rather meet with Jane.

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
You retrieved her, yes?
Call her here.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center line:84%
You summoned me, Majesty?

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've brought the
medicine you so desire.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
Catesby, leave us.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] So it'll be
terminated with one dose?

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center line:84%
I, um, didn't want this.
I only wanted to be the king.

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
Having regrets is simply
a part of living.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] The date of your
execution has been set, my lord.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tomorrow.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will not Richard let
me speak with him?

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tomorrow's All Souls' Day.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center line:84%
We my pray for any soul,
damned or not.

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center line:84%
For friends, foes, and even
for despicable traitors.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Prayers?

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center line:84%
I cannot imagine a single thing
that could be less fitting.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
For depraved demons like us.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's wrong, very wrong!

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard, you were never a demon!
The lone demonic one was me.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50% align:center line:84%
If You truly preside
over this world, 

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I'll spend my final
hours in devout prayer.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, Lord, do not
punish Richard.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A] Your
Grace, the Duke of Buckingham!

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
Their talks of marriage
are ridiculous.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not too long ago, they were
all fighting to the death.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now they make a show of joy?

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Once I wed this woman, 

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
my life might as well
come to an end.

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be living like a pet dog
with no will of my own,

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
and that's no better than dying.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD grunts]

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
Training during peacetime?
The child of some noble?

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are... they a boy or girl?

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM gasps]

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM grunts]
That hurt.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you suicidal?

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
Lord Richard,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
the feast is about to start!

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center line:84%
On my way!

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, wait!

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
[scoffs] Use your
head more, damn brat.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't die, even if you are weak.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT A]
Shameless wretch!

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT B]
Burn in Hell, you traitor!

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT C]
Off with his head!

00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:59.277 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
I am at death's door,

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
yet I still don't believe
in God or fate.

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have no regrets, though.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:08.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was born into this world,
and got to meet you.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] There's nothing
more to say. Do it.

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:19.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
I had many wishes realized,

00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:21.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
but if I could have
just one more...

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:31.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
I'd wish... to see you.

00:22:31.643 --> 00:22:33.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then to my grave I'd go.

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:53.957 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[RICHARD] Henry.
--[BUCKINGHAM gasps]

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.335 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fare thee well.
Wait for me in Hell.

00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:03.049 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] We'll meet again,
I swear it!

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:24.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] With this blood,
our new covenant is sealed.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
That our reunion in
death it might yield.
