[BETH cries]

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
She has His Majesty's features.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
Indeed.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
A lovely little princess!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] A girl?
The next one will be a prince.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
And once an heir is born,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
the Duke of Clarence
will lose his place.

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
Much like the Earl of Warwick.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Why Edward?

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
I am in love with Isabelle,
so why can I not marry her?

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.872 position:50% align:center
Some are uneasy about
your relationship

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
with Warwick and how
close you've become.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
And who would that make uneasy?

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Did that woman
put you up to this?

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
York of the white rose,

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
and Lancaster of the red.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center

[LOUIS]
Lift your head, Margaret.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.545 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET gasps] I thank you
for giving my tongue-tied

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
sorrows leave
to speak, for proud,

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
ambitious Edward now
proclaims himself the lawful

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50% align:center
King of England.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
But he is not the true king.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
Yes. The rightful
ruler is my father.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50% align:center
If only I had found him first!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't have been taken
captive by those frauds!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Why?

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
What was Father
doing with Richard?

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.444 position:50% align:center
Was the throne not enough?

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
Does he plan to steal
everything from me?

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] But King Henry
yet lives, does he not?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET]
Ours is a fight against time.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
The more we stay,
the stronger grows our foe.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS]
Oh. It seems he's arrived.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD gasp]

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What in God's name...

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
...are you doing here?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
How dare you!
Shameless familiar of York!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty.
My righteous queen.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET gasps]

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[LOUIS] Sheathe your sword,
young prince.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
It would not do to strike
down your would-be savior.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
But... how?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
How will someone like
Warwick save us?

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
My queen.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
I beg you and your son to
forget our past enmity.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
you and I share the same goal.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
The rebel Edward has
dishonored me as well.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
I wish to become
your loyal servitor,

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
and by doing so, may I avenge
Edward's wrong to Lady Bona

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
and restore King Henry
to his proper station.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
Warwick.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
One might assume that you're
God by the way you're speaking.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
Just His ward.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
And He sent you to me.
I'm so pleased.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
All of the hatred I held for you

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
has suddenly turned into love.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
Warwick, it's our time now.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
You and I.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
And His Majesty,
the King of France.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
Let us all join forces and
depose the false king

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
in short order.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
Mother...

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
However, I want a pledge to
further fortify our alliance.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
Some proof that
this is no trick.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
Proof like what?

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
Just something that
displays true loyalty.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK gasps]

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
Love. Since you love your
eldest daughter so,

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50% align:center
I want you to give her to
our prince in holy wedlock.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
It would appear
something troubles you.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
How fare York's sons these days?

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center
For example, is Richard well?

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
Though I know naught
of the eldest,

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50% align:center
Richard currently
resides in my castle.

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
Most of his time is spent
with my daughter--

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Oh, I see!
He's staying with you!

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] I have no desire
to wed Warwick's daughter.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
But Mother would
never let me refuse.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
Still, if I can see Richard
one last time before I marry.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
By God, I'm going to see her!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
Warwick, please! I beg!

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Take me back to
England alongside you!

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Richard.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Richard! I have found you!

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
What's wrong?

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
The second that you
learn who I really am,

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
I know that you will
leave me, as well.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't, though.
I will always stay beside you.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
There you are!

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
--[RICHARD] Anne.
--[ANNE] I hoped we could talk

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
because it's been so
hard for me lately.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
Pretending to like
you is sheer agony.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] After all,
we both know the truth.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
I truly despise you!
With every fiber of my being!

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD groans]

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
Stay away. Please, Henry.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
I can't take anymore.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Richard!

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
There is no one else here.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
No one to hurt you,
and no one to love you.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
This is a royal palace.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
For you alone.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting company.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
Do you know where Anne is?

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
I'm not sure, but--

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
Who is your guest?

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
You shall all be
introduced anon.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
Await Lady Anne in
the drawing room.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
Sure. But there's
really no rush.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] In your absence, I've
done my best to mend relations

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
between Anne and Gloucester,
but it's not looking promising.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
That matter is finished.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Oh?

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
I have decided to take you
and your sister to France.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
For what cause, may I ask?

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.334 position:50% align:center
One involving George.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] So then,
it's finally time to begin?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.183 position:50% align:center
That girl. Just where
could she be?

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What are you doing here?

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Huh?

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
Richard!

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
You, sir, are not
of this castle.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
I only arrived with the lord of
the manor mere moments ago.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
I went to explore and
was separated from him.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Have you been dreaming

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
of that memory as I have?

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
When your lips met mine.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
And began to dance.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
Ah, there you are!

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anne.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
This is my betrothed?

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
So, um.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
I came upon a patch
of berries growing

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
in the woods the other day.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.594 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Would you like to
go pick some, Lord Richard?

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
It could be fun!
We can ride horseback!

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Anne. You're free
from your obligation.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
You needn't force
yourself anymore.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
I would thank you not
to wander off alone again.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving. My proper
place is with our king.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
Regrettable.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Is that so?
What an odd response.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
I really should
thank you, though.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
I have learned so very
much from your tutelage.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Yes, you taught me well.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
Never again will I lose
sight of my position

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
and let foolish
emotions sway me.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
This was the last time.

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.894 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Why did you let Richard go?

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
The stake intended
to bind him to me 

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
was sadly taken by
your mother's demands.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
What stake? Do you mean Anne?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
That would make sense.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
I saw them interact briefly.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
It's clear she has
feelings for Richard.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
A child's caprice.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
She'll soon forget him.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't be so sure.
I know how you are.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
Your mind changes like the wind.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
You may deem you're better with
the Yorks after all and resume 

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
your plot to wed
Anne and Richard.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
Today was the last they shall
ever see of each other.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
"Trust me," he says.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
Bring down the monarch
you wrongfully raised

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
and you shall have
my full confidence.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
So then, what is your intention?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
Stay until that happens.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] If the
Lancasters regain the throne,

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to deal with
Richard however I like.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
And anyone who gets in my way

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
can rot in the Tower
until they die.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Hmph!

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Fine. I've no objection.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
If you wish to see Edward fall,
you won't wait long.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
His end is nigh.

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
[MALE COMMONER A]
To arms!

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
[COMMONERS shout]

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
Just when I thought
we'd found peace,

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
a rebel army calls for a fight.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
Their claims state
you've betrayed

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
the traditional nobility.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
That you unjustly appointed
the upstart Woodvilles

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
and showed them undue favor.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
Foolishness. I've heard
similar whispers in the past.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
Overthinking matters is
bad for your health.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
You are showing signs of
another pregnancy, right?

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Yes.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH laughs]

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I know it all
too well, Your Majesty.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
I need an heir before
you die on me.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] This tumult.
The weight of steel.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Tension and excitement
that make me tremble.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
I've come home
to the battlefield.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
Such a shame.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
Had the Duke of Clarence
known he'd miss Gloucester's

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.732 position:50% align:center
first campaign, I wonder if he
still would've gone to France.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's not just George.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
Warwick isn't here either.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST MESSENGER A]
Sire. A message.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Is that a coincidence?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD growls]
I don't believe it!

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
I never gave him my permission.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
While in France,
George and Isabelle Neville

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
were married without
my blessing.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIERS chatter]

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Your Majesty, I can't
help but think a temporary

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
retreat would be advisable.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
It's possible George is
in league with Warwick

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
since he wed Isabelle
without your consent.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
They could be the ones
plotting this whole revolt.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Absurd. What reason could
they have for such betrayal?

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Your Grace.
Surely you've heard.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Rumors tell of Warwick
instigating this uprising.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
I say we withdraw,
augment our forces in London.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
I agree with Hastings,
my lord brother!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
Marrying without first
obtaining your permission

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
is a clear act
of rebellion, yes?

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
We should overwhelm
them with our troops

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
and punish them severely
for their crimes--

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Anthony!

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Though you're brother in name,
George is brother by blood,

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
and my ties with
Warwick go beyond that,

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
we have often shared the
space between life and death.

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
If there is a knife in my back,
it will not be from those two.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
I'd simply be fallen if it were.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
Do mind your tongue.

[YORK]
There is no one else here.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
This is a royal
palace for you alone.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I do feel at ease in there.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
But the waking world
has no such palace.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SOLDIER A]
That's impossible.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SOLDIER B]
Think about it, though.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
If the Earl of Warrick manages
to defeat King Edward,

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
the Duke of Clarence could
very well be the new king.

It's the duke we want!

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center

I need a weapon!

Why didn't you run

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center

I hear the king's little
brother is awfully small.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll find out once my
lords get a look at you.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
Warrick and the Duke
of Clarence will know.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps] I was right.
He really is after the throne!

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center

Keep quiet and come with me.

Mm.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I never thought
this body of mine

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
would prove useful.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
In any case, I must
rejoin the main force.

What a wanton woman you are

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
to tempt a man at
a time like this.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
I'd rather die in your lap than
on the battlefield, anyway.

Stop!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center

--[CATESBY] This way!

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
I confirmed His Royal Majesty

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
and Lord Hastings were
heading in this direction.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Why part from
Hastings to begin with?

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
He's your master now.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] I did not see you
among the others, Lord Richard.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
It's only natural for
the knights of the realm

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
to protect the royal family.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I told you before.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
Don't let your loyalty to my

[RICHARD]
I-I can still walk.

There's no time
to treat a wound;

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
joining up with

Over here! Come quick!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Warwick.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
So you repay my
trust with treachery.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] That's a rather
poor jest, Edward.

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:07.277 position:50% align:center
Just Edward, am I?
Last we met, you called me king.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Perhaps you forgot,

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
but it was you who
betrayed my trust.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
You knocked me to the
ground and disgraced me.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
Think back, Edward.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
That's enough. I command
you to mend your speech

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
this instant and call me king.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
I shall forgive all
your outrages if you--

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] It appears you have
yet to grasp your position.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
You are not worthy
to govern this land.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
Thus, you are no longer my king.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
You brought the kingdom ruin.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
But luckily, there's time to
crown the true sovereign.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
"The true sovereign".
Who would that be?

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
He is here now.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
My lord, George, is indeed
the rightful king.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
And I, his faithful vassal.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
There're no signs of pursuit.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Whatever hogwash
Warwick might use,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
George could never
take up the throne.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Assuming that King Edward
is still alive, of course.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Catesby.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
You said it's only natural for
a knight to defend royalty.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
If I betrayed the king,
what would you do?

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
Speak honestly.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
If I sought the throne,
how would you respond?

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
My lord.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
That's easy.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
I will defend the
Royal Family of York.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
Your father. He's the reason
I'm not dead and buried.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
So, much like a shadow,
I follow the House of York.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt many would love
to have a retainer like you.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Think, Richard.
What's the best choice?

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
Who is most worthy
of the throne?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'll lose
everything unless I fight.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
To those who take,
but have no right.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
With the king defeated,

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
who does England even belong to?

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
Who is sitting on the throne
at this very moment?

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Elizabeth! The king and
his army were ambushed!

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Is His Majesty dead?

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] N-No. But they
took him prisoner.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT C]
My queen!

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
Troops led by Lord Warwick

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
and the Duke of
Clarence are coming!

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
So they're our foes.
Warwick, foolish man.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] If you intend
to flee, take my bride with you.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
She is one of your younger
sisters, after all, right?

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
By all means, come with
us yourself, Buckingham.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Make ready!

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
The women and children
should go first, though.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
Hey, Anthony.

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
What's happened to Richard?

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
I've no idea where he wound up,
but I do know Father was caught!

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
He's probably already dead since
Warwick wants to kill us all

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
and exact his revenge!

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I will never
let him do such a thing.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Never.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Once you've secured the queen,

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
take her directly to the Tower.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
You are to treat her
with the utmost care.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
Sir!

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] It's tragic how easily
pregnant women perish.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
I'm so close.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
My plan has almost
reached fruition.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
So your vengeance will not come
at the sake of mine, Warwick.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Well met, Lord Buckingham.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
You didn't happen to see
the queen, I suppose?

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
And just what would
you do if I did?

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] I like to consider
you a fairly clever fellow.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
You ought to know what the
safest course of action is.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
If they do get rid of Edward

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
and the queen's family,
the new king will be George.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
And once he's crowned,

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
next in line to the
throne would be...

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.189 position:50% align:center
Excellent point, my lord.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
I will be sure to inform
you if I see her.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Hm. Let's move out.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] This chance
is too good to pass up.

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
A throne atop unsteady
ground invites change.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Hm! New plan.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
You're to search
for Richard now.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
Find him before Warrick does!

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST FOLLOWER B]
Right.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] For my king,
I've decided on you.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] A man who has
no awareness as king.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
A man who is
unqualified to be king.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.515 position:50% align:center
Neither of them is
fit for the throne.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Even so, Warwick.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
Never will I give
this kingdom to you.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] And thus, we ride
to King Edward's rescue!

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center line:10%
