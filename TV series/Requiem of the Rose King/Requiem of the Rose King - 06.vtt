00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
This was the last time.

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.894 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Why did you let Richard go?

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
The stake intended
to bind him to me 

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
was sadly taken by
your mother's demands.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
What stake? Do you mean Anne?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
That would make sense.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
I saw them interact briefly.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
It's clear she has
feelings for Richard.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
A child's caprice.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
She'll soon forget him.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't be so sure.
I know how you are.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
Your mind changes like the wind.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
You may deem you're better with
the Yorks after all and resume 

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
your plot to wed
Anne and Richard.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
Today was the last they shall
ever see of each other.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
"Trust me," he says.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
Bring down the monarch
you wrongfully raised

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
and you shall have
my full confidence.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
So then, what is your intention?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
Stay until that happens.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] If the
Lancasters regain the throne,

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to deal with
Richard however I like.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
And anyone who gets in my way

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
can rot in the Tower
until they die.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Hmph!

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Fine. I've no objection.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
If you wish to see Edward fall,
you won't wait long.

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
His end is nigh.

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
[MALE COMMONER A]
To arms!

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
[COMMONERS shout]

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
Just when I thought
we'd found peace,

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
a rebel army calls for a fight.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
Their claims state
you've betrayed

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
the traditional nobility.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
That you unjustly appointed
the upstart Woodvilles

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
and showed them undue favor.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
Foolishness. I've heard
similar whispers in the past.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
Overthinking matters is
bad for your health.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
You are showing signs of
another pregnancy, right?

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Yes.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH laughs]

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I know it all
too well, Your Majesty.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
I need an heir before
you die on me.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] This tumult.
The weight of steel.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Tension and excitement
that make me tremble.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
I've come home
to the battlefield.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
Such a shame.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
Had the Duke of Clarence
known he'd miss Gloucester's

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.732 position:50% align:center
first campaign, I wonder if he
still would've gone to France.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's not just George.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
Warwick isn't here either.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST MESSENGER A]
Sire. A message.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Is that a coincidence?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD growls]
I don't believe it!

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
I never gave him my permission.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
While in France,
George and Isabelle Neville

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
were married without
my blessing.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIERS chatter]

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Your Majesty, I can't
help but think a temporary

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
retreat would be advisable.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
It's possible George is
in league with Warwick

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
since he wed Isabelle
without your consent.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
They could be the ones
plotting this whole revolt.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Absurd. What reason could
they have for such betrayal?

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Your Grace.
Surely you've heard.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Rumors tell of Warwick
instigating this uprising.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
I say we withdraw,
augment our forces in London.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
I agree with Hastings,
my lord brother!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
Marrying without first
obtaining your permission

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
is a clear act
of rebellion, yes?

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
We should overwhelm
them with our troops

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
and punish them severely
for their crimes--

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Anthony!

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Though you're brother in name,
George is brother by blood,

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
and my ties with
Warwick go beyond that,

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
we have often shared the
space between life and death.

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
If there is a knife in my back,
it will not be from those two.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
I'd simply be fallen if it were.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
Do mind your tongue.

[YORK]
There is no one else here.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
This is a royal
palace for you alone.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I do feel at ease in there.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
But the waking world
has no such palace.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SOLDIER A]
That's impossible.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SOLDIER B]
Think about it, though.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
If the Earl of Warrick manages
to defeat King Edward,

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
the Duke of Clarence could
very well be the new king.

It's the duke we want!

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center

I need a weapon!

Why didn't you run

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center

I hear the king's little
brother is awfully small.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll find out once my
lords get a look at you.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
Warrick and the Duke
of Clarence will know.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps] I was right.
He really is after the throne!

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center

Keep quiet and come with me.

Mm.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I never thought
this body of mine

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
would prove useful.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
In any case, I must
rejoin the main force.

What a wanton woman you are

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
to tempt a man at
a time like this.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
I'd rather die in your lap than
on the battlefield, anyway.

Stop!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center

--[CATESBY] This way!

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
I confirmed His Royal Majesty

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
and Lord Hastings were
heading in this direction.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Why part from
Hastings to begin with?

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
He's your master now.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] I did not see you
among the others, Lord Richard.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
It's only natural for
the knights of the realm

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
to protect the royal family.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I told you before.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
Don't let your loyalty to my

[RICHARD]
I-I can still walk.

There's no time
to treat a wound;

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
joining up with

Over here! Come quick!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Warwick.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
So you repay my
trust with treachery.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] That's a rather
poor jest, Edward.

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:07.277 position:50% align:center
Just Edward, am I?
Last we met, you called me king.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Perhaps you forgot,

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
but it was you who
betrayed my trust.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
You knocked me to the
ground and disgraced me.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
Think back, Edward.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
That's enough. I command
you to mend your speech

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
this instant and call me king.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
I shall forgive all
your outrages if you--

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] It appears you have
yet to grasp your position.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
You are not worthy
to govern this land.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
Thus, you are no longer my king.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
You brought the kingdom ruin.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
But luckily, there's time to
crown the true sovereign.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
"The true sovereign".
Who would that be?

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
He is here now.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
My lord, George, is indeed
the rightful king.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
And I, his faithful vassal.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
There're no signs of pursuit.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Whatever hogwash
Warwick might use,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
George could never
take up the throne.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Assuming that King Edward
is still alive, of course.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Catesby.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
You said it's only natural for
a knight to defend royalty.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
If I betrayed the king,
what would you do?

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
Speak honestly.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
If I sought the throne,
how would you respond?

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
My lord.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
That's easy.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
I will defend the
Royal Family of York.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
Your father. He's the reason
I'm not dead and buried.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
So, much like a shadow,
I follow the House of York.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt many would love
to have a retainer like you.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Think, Richard.
What's the best choice?

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
Who is most worthy
of the throne?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'll lose
everything unless I fight.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
To those who take,
but have no right.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
With the king defeated,

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
who does England even belong to?

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
Who is sitting on the throne
at this very moment?

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Elizabeth! The king and
his army were ambushed!

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Is His Majesty dead?

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] N-No. But they
took him prisoner.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE YORKIST ATTENDANT C]
My queen!

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
Troops led by Lord Warwick

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
and the Duke of
Clarence are coming!

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
So they're our foes.
Warwick, foolish man.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] If you intend
to flee, take my bride with you.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
She is one of your younger
sisters, after all, right?

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
By all means, come with
us yourself, Buckingham.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Make ready!

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
The women and children
should go first, though.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
Hey, Anthony.

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
What's happened to Richard?

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
I've no idea where he wound up,
but I do know Father was caught!

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
He's probably already dead since
Warwick wants to kill us all

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
and exact his revenge!

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I will never
let him do such a thing.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Never.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Once you've secured the queen,

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
take her directly to the Tower.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
You are to treat her
with the utmost care.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
Sir!

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] It's tragic how easily
pregnant women perish.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
I'm so close.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
My plan has almost
reached fruition.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
So your vengeance will not come
at the sake of mine, Warwick.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Well met, Lord Buckingham.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
You didn't happen to see
the queen, I suppose?

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
And just what would
you do if I did?

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] I like to consider
you a fairly clever fellow.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
You ought to know what the
safest course of action is.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
If they do get rid of Edward

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
and the queen's family,
the new king will be George.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
And once he's crowned,

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
next in line to the
throne would be...

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.189 position:50% align:center
Excellent point, my lord.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
I will be sure to inform
you if I see her.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Hm. Let's move out.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] This chance
is too good to pass up.

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
A throne atop unsteady
ground invites change.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Hm! New plan.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
You're to search
for Richard now.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
Find him before Warrick does!

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST FOLLOWER B]
Right.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] For my king,
I've decided on you.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] A man who has
no awareness as king.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
A man who is
unqualified to be king.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.515 position:50% align:center
Neither of them is
fit for the throne.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Even so, Warwick.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
Never will I give
this kingdom to you.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:22:00.862 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] And thus, we ride
to King Edward's rescue!
