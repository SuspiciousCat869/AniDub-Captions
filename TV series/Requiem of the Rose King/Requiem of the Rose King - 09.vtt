You're my very
own angel, Richard.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.019 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I can't stay
with you. Not like this.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
Not if you want me to
remain your friend.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD whimpers]
How shallow I am.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center
The moment I realize I love him,
I desire his love in return.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
What's the matter?

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
You'll be cold by yourself.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
Come close.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
York of the white rose,

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
and Lancaster of the red.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

[YORKIST ATTENDANT 8A]
Henry seems to have fled

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
while on a pilgrimage.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
You know his face,
do you not, Mister Catesby?

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
Capturing him would give us a
huge advantage, so I say we--

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
Recovering Lord
Richard comes first!

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
Go retrace our steps.
Be even more thorough.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT 8A]
Yes, sir!

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Those markings...

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
It can't be. No, I'm sure of it.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
He's none other than...

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
Henry--

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
Hide, Your Grace!

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Catesby. Stand down.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
This man is not our enemy.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
I was too injured to
move for a short while.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
He found me and
helped me survive.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
But, my lord, do you
know who he is?

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
My friend, of course.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
Catesby, give us a moment.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
He and I have known each
other since I was young.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I'll be
leaving with him.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
Wait, you will?

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'm well now.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center
And I said I would leave
once my wounds healed.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
There are matters that still
require my attention.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] The matters of
winning George to our cause

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
and annihilating Lancaster.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
So go. Finish your tasks.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
Once you do, may we
be together then?

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] My place on this earth
will cease along with the war.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
Meet under our tree.
Promise me you will, all right?

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
And know I'll always
be waiting here.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
Very well. I promise
to meet you again.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
I'm certain around
this time next year,

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
it will all be over.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] Then in a year's time,
we'll reunite.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
It's a promise, then. Agreed?

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
Our promise.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Lord Richard. Who was he?

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
I don't know his origins.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
Though, he did say
he was a shepherd.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
Catesby. Have... Have you ever
been in love with anybody?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
Despite already knowing
that your feelings 

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
would go unrequited?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.603 position:50% align:center
Would you stay... beside them?

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
Unable to speak
how you truly feel,

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
yet content to be
in their company.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.032 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
How am I to go about this?

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
From George's perspective,
the traitorous one is me,

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
so there is little point to a
straightforward conversation.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
[BOY pants]

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
[BOY, FATHER laugh]

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD sighs] I remember when
Christmas was approaching.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
The time... when I lost Father.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.266 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Surely George
has similar thoughts

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
around this time.

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIERS grunting]

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
What's all the
commotion out here?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A]
Lord George.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
So this is His Royal Highness!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
Please believe me!
Saw him with my own eyes!

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A] Disregard
this drunk's nonsense, my lord.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
I really saw him!

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
You're the one
spewing nonsense here!

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Who is it you saw?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT laughs]

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
Looked like a ghost
with long, flowing hair.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
Gliding along the castle
walls with an ethereal glow.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
Mysteriously... Ha, ha, ha!

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
I think I see him behind
you at this very moment!

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
I'll give you
sixpence to go home

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
and leave my men in peace.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT chuckles]
Take care, Your Grace!

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
Spirits are known to grow
stronger around Christmas time.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Though it may be true
that something presently

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
haunts me, it's no ghost.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
If only I were so lucky.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
Why so sullen?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
There's a banquet
about to begin.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE A]
Now for the moment you've all

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
been waiting for, the selecting
of tonight's "king."

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE B]
The crown will go to whomever

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
has a bean in his cake!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE C]
And the lucky winner is?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE A]
Why, it's the Earl of Warwick!

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
The throne is yours,
Your Majesty.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
I suppose I've no choice.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] I should be the
one seated on that throne.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
How did Warwick of all people
come to take my place?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
No. Henry is king,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
and after him is the
Lancastrian prince.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
Where did I go wrong?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE A]
Well then, Your Majesty,

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.531 position:50% align:center
shall we summon the
actors for the masque?

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] I am King
Edward's younger brother,

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
and thus his heir apparent.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.829 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT A]
Lord George,

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
the attendees wish to present
you with this splendid wine.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
Bring me all that you have.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
I'll drink every bottle
in the entire castle dry!

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR A] Hear me! For I am
the lawful King of England!

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR A] Where has he gone?
Where is my son?

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR B]
Father!

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Father.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.604 position:50% align:center
From this day hence,
I pledge my life

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
to the battle for the crown
that is rightfully yours.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
Will you join me, George?

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
Yes! I will! I swear it!

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center

[YORKIST SERVANT A]
Your Highness!

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
A breath of fresh air
might do you some good.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
True. Yes, perhaps.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
You've drank a bit too much.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
Oh. Seems I've
interrupted the fun.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
Apologies, Your Majesty.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
I shall not borrow
the hand of a king.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
I'll leave on my own.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Did I... make an
error in judgment?

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
If I did, it's too late now.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
Has one of the actors
followed me here?

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center

Hello, George.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
Where's my promised crown?

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
My son, what of the oath
that you and Edward made?

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
Will the white rose of York be
dyed with blood by your hand?

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
I-Impossible.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
No! You're an illusion!

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
George. Do not disgrace
the spirit of York.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
For if you make that mistake,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
know you shall
live to regret it.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
Go now. Return the crown to
these hands like you swore!

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
Stop it, Father! Just go away!

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center

[RICHARD]
A virtuoso performance, Catesby.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
Even I was nearly convinced
you were my father.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
Continue spreading the rumors.
Bring our ghost story to life.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
Whenever a chance arrives,

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
allow Father to emerge from
somewhere George can see.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT 8A]
Right!

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
The more pressure we apply,

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
the more effective that
flag will prove to be.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
George is simple-minded.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
This act will move him
more than any argument.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
I do feel guilty for using
Father's memory as a tool,

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
but it's all to clear the
shadow that still hangs over it.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
So you've made up your mind?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
You'll defeat the
Lancastrian king?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
Of course I will.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
He's why Father is dead,

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
so I'll do more than
lock him in the Tower.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
Mark my words. I will
slay him on the field.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT B]
My Lord! I bring news!

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
We've confirmed Edward
has set sail for England,

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
rallying the
support of Burgundy!

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Your days are
numbered now, Warwick.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
I will rouse a tempest the likes
of which you've never dreamed.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
Just you wait.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
I'll see that this great storm
rages on 'til a golden crown

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
gleams brilliantly upon my head!

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT B] What shall
we do, Your Excellency?

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
Come now.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
You think the King of France
has yet to make any moves?

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Go full speed ahead!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
Should the winds object,
still stay the course!

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
So England is not
taken by force!

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] Your Majesty.
I wondered where you had gone.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
Why don't you wait inside?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
We can't have you falling ill.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
I shall remain here.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer a snowfield
over a battlefield.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] If that's
what you wish, my king.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
There is much to do.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
First off, find loyal recruits.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
Capturing the Yorkist
nobles should be done

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
--with the utmost haste--
--[HENRY] Don't kill them.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
There's been more
than enough war.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
Stun them with our numbers.
They'll flee in fear.

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
The only way to end the war
is to eradicate our enemy.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
Now, gentlemen.
Let us go make plans.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBORDINATE A]
God bless you, Your Grace.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBORDINATE B]
By Your Majesty's leave.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Allow me to kiss
the hand of my sovereign.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
A sign of truth and loyalty.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] Well-minded George.
May the Lord be with you.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
War won't end. Ever.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Though flesh withers
and dies, the soul doesn't.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
Sadly, the spirit of
vengeance endures.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] You know I'm
not going to try anything.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
I'm sleeping here to fool
my mother, nothing more.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] Oh, how I
despair of you, Edward.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
When did you--?!
What I meant--

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET]
I thought you better than Henry,

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
but even he performed
his duty as a man.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
Are you truly so
wanting for courage?

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
I've twenty times his courage!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
Do you? No, I think not.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
All you've proven to me
is you are less of a man

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
than your father.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
That's not true. I surpass
that man in every way.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
Then, by all means,
please show me.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
Fulfill your duty,
before my very eyes.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] A king performs
in front of any number

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
of subjects regularly.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
If this is beyond you, you are
clearly unfit for the crown.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Surely you understand... Anne.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Understand?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how much you
care or don't care for her.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
You were both born as women.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
Thus, she would never requite
your shallow feelings

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
to begin with.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
You don't mind? At all?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.484 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Why would I mind?

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
I'm your wife.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] And no matter
what I do at this point,

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard will never
again smile on me.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
I thank you for having far
more resolve than my son.

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
How reminiscent of Henry and me.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Enough!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
I am the furthest thing
from that wretch!

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
To accuse me of being inferior,

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
when that could
never be the case!

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
You want me to prove
it here and now?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
Watch as I show you why I'm
a man you can be proud of!

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD grunts]

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
Please wait.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
I'll fulfill my duty as your
wife, but promise me one thing.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
If you capture Lord Richard
in the coming fight,

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
promise me that
you won't kill him.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
That was already
my intention, you know.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] Seems we're amassing
our troops without difficulty.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT C]
Indeed.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
And Queen Margaret's fleet
should be docking any day now.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
Once Her Majesty's
reinforcements arrive

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
and swell our ranks,

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
the sham army Edward borrowed
from foreign powers

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
will be nothing when
pitted against us.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT C] In regard to
who's going to greet the queen--

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
Yes, I've already sent someone.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
She shall be received
by the man I trust most.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
You have done well,
my young brother.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
Though, we must also thank
God for our safe reunion.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
Edward. This cannot be
your entire army.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Considering who
we're up against,

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
I doubt we have
enough men to win.

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
Hence the mission I gave you.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
Should it turn out the
other brother of our house

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
chooses not to return...

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
...this is where Edward of York
is fated to meet his end.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD sighs]

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
George.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
You filthy traitor!

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
My sister became the rightful
queen through matrimony!

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Your brother did nothing wrong,
but you forsook him for Henry!

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Silence, Anthony.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
I'll ask only once.
Whom is it you serve, George?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
I would think the
answer's quite obvious.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
The King of England, of course.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
Well, I am on my way to York
as merely the Duke of York

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
with no other purpose.
So please, grant us passage.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
That, I cannot do.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Brother! Don't call
yourself duke

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
when that title is not
the one you bear!

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
I came to serve a king!

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
The House of York.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
The house of our father,

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
who shed his blood
for our England.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
I cannot bring it to ruin.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
Come, Edward.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Before everyone, proclaim
yourself the rightful king!

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
Now, more than ever, I serve
as your faithful champion!

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
My sweet brother!
Such stirring words!

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Now, welcome more,
and ten times more beloved,

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
than if thou never hadst
deserved our hate.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
I-I'm sorry.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
We must make haste.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
Warwick is raising
troops everywhere.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
We should slip between
their lines while we can,

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
and reach the capital
before they do.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
They've left Henry
alone in the palace.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Once we enter
the city, he's ours.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
So we're bound for London?

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
The plan is to head south

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
after we've gathered some
more troops in York.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Now that George once again
fights alongside us,

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
more men should
flock to our banner.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] I've a request
for you, my lord.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
With all due respect,
please leave Henry to me.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] If you were
to come across Henry.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT D]
Mister Catesby!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
Lord Hastings is
calling for you.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
Please return to your master.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
Your mission with me
has long since ended.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It will be by my own hands.

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
I am Edward Plantagenet
of House York.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
I am also this country's
rightful king!

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll strike Henry down,

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
and avenge Father's death!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
So, you came to see me.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
I wonder, have I
been a bad king?

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
Please give me your
honest unbiased opinion.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
I heard my people's pleas.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
Did my mercy not dry
all of their tears?

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
I wasn't greedy enough to
take their wealth from them.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
I did not want them to
suffer because of me.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
I-I never wanted to be king.
Not even a little.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
Don't suppose you
want out of here.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
Of course you do,
it is such a lovely day.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
Once it gets warmer,
the flowers will bloom.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
That's how you know
summer will be here soon.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
Trees will bear fruit as
leaves fall to the wind.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
And then. At long last...

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
...I'll see you again.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
Henry! Where are you?

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
--[footsteps]
--[RICHARD gasps]

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM gasps]
Richard? Hey!

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
Tell me plain!
Where is King Henry?

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to know that?

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
Until just mere moments ago,

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
Warwick locked me up
and threw away the key!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
Richard! You won't
kill him, will you?

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
Your Grace!

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
You must flee immediately!

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
The Yorkists have invaded London

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
and would gladly
take you prisoner!

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] If I'm captured, Richard
and I will never reunite.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
Quickly!

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
The confusion will mask
your escape if you go now!

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
And what of Henry?

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT E]
We searched the whole castle,

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
but he's not here.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
Search all of London
and spread word.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Whoever finds him shall
be handsomely rewarded!

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Killing Henry
at this point in time

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
would be unwise.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
Act too rashly,

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
and your brother's trust
goes up in smoke.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
One would think you're
a faithful retainer

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
from the way you're speaking.

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Just observant.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
Hello, my darling.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
Hello, Elizabeth.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the delay.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
It's all right. Now you
can meet your son.

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Oh, dear Lord in heaven!

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
Bless both the day and this boy!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
George returned to him,
and an heir was born to him.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
Even if Edward were to perish,

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
the throne would still be
well beyond your reach.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
When did I desire a throne?

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
It's time you were honest
with yourself, Richard.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
I am no fool, though I might be
if I were to believe my words

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
have never once moved you.

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
And know, I'll always
be waiting here.

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
I shall destroy Lancaster,
and avenge my father.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
Everything ends with that.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
When there's no battlefield,
I'll not be on a throne--

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
How strange. I read you wrong.

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
I thought that, like myself,

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
you were smoldering with
this constrained ambition.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
It appears I was mistaken.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] How were they able
to slip past, unnoticed?

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
They were completely hemmed in,
or so I thought.

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
Did George and his
men fall asleep?

00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
No matter.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
Edward can take London and even
run Henry through if he chooses.

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
The fact remains our
forces outnumber his

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
and he'll fall to our might.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
Just you wait.

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
To repay you, Edward,
for all you took,

00:21:57.192 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
I'll claim your head with
the hand you once shook.

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:16.419 position:50% align:center
