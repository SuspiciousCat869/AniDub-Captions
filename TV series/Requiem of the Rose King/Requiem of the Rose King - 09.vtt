00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
but it's all to clear the
shadow that still hangs over it.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
So you've made up your mind?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
You'll defeat the
Lancastrian king?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
Of course I will.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
He's why Father is dead,

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
so I'll do more than
lock him in the Tower.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
Mark my words. I will
slay him on the field.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT B]
My Lord! I bring news!

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
We've confirmed Edward
has set sail for England,

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
rallying the
support of Burgundy!

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Your days are
numbered now, Warwick.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
I will rouse a tempest the likes
of which you've never dreamed.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
Just you wait.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
I'll see that this great storm
rages on 'til a golden crown

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
gleams brilliantly upon my head!

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT B] What shall
we do, Your Excellency?

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
Come now.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
You think the King of France
has yet to make any moves?

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Go full speed ahead!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
Should the winds object,
still stay the course!

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
So England is not
taken by force!

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] Your Majesty.
I wondered where you had gone.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
Why don't you wait inside?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
We can't have you falling ill.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
I shall remain here.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer a snowfield
over a battlefield.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] If that's
what you wish, my king.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
There is much to do.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
First off, find loyal recruits.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
Capturing the Yorkist
nobles should be done

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
--with the utmost haste--
--[HENRY] Don't kill them.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
There's been more
than enough war.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
Stun them with our numbers.
They'll flee in fear.

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
The only way to end the war
is to eradicate our enemy.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
Now, gentlemen.
Let us go make plans.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBORDINATE A]
God bless you, Your Grace.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBORDINATE B]
By Your Majesty's leave.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Allow me to kiss
the hand of my sovereign.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
A sign of truth and loyalty.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] Well-minded George.
May the Lord be with you.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
War won't end. Ever.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Though flesh withers
and dies, the soul doesn't.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
Sadly, the spirit of
vengeance endures.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] You know I'm
not going to try anything.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
I'm sleeping here to fool
my mother, nothing more.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] Oh, how I
despair of you, Edward.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
When did you--?!
What I meant--

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET]
I thought you better than Henry,

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
but even he performed
his duty as a man.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
Are you truly so
wanting for courage?

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
I've twenty times his courage!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
Do you? No, I think not.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
All you've proven to me
is you are less of a man

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
than your father.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
That's not true. I surpass
that man in every way.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
Then, by all means,
please show me.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
Fulfill your duty,
before my very eyes.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] A king performs
in front of any number

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
of subjects regularly.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
If this is beyond you, you are
clearly unfit for the crown.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Surely you understand... Anne.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Understand?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how much you
care or don't care for her.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
You were both born as women.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
Thus, she would never requite
your shallow feelings

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
to begin with.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
You don't mind? At all?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.484 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Why would I mind?

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
I'm your wife.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] And no matter
what I do at this point,

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard will never
again smile on me.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
I thank you for having far
more resolve than my son.

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
How reminiscent of Henry and me.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Enough!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
I am the furthest thing
from that wretch!

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
To accuse me of being inferior,

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
when that could
never be the case!

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
You want me to prove
it here and now?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
Watch as I show you why I'm
a man you can be proud of!

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD grunts]

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
Please wait.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
I'll fulfill my duty as your
wife, but promise me one thing.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
If you capture Lord Richard
in the coming fight,

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
promise me that
you won't kill him.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
That was already
my intention, you know.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] Seems we're amassing
our troops without difficulty.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT C]
Indeed.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
And Queen Margaret's fleet
should be docking any day now.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
Once Her Majesty's
reinforcements arrive

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
and swell our ranks,

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
the sham army Edward borrowed
from foreign powers

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
will be nothing when
pitted against us.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT C] In regard to
who's going to greet the queen--

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
Yes, I've already sent someone.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
She shall be received
by the man I trust most.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
You have done well,
my young brother.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
Though, we must also thank
God for our safe reunion.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
Edward. This cannot be
your entire army.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Considering who
we're up against,

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
I doubt we have
enough men to win.

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
Hence the mission I gave you.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
Should it turn out the
other brother of our house

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
chooses not to return...

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
...this is where Edward of York
is fated to meet his end.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD sighs]

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
George.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
You filthy traitor!

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
My sister became the rightful
queen through matrimony!

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Your brother did nothing wrong,
but you forsook him for Henry!

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Silence, Anthony.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
I'll ask only once.
Whom is it you serve, George?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
I would think the
answer's quite obvious.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
The King of England, of course.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
Well, I am on my way to York
as merely the Duke of York

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
with no other purpose.
So please, grant us passage.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
That, I cannot do.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Brother! Don't call
yourself duke

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
when that title is not
the one you bear!

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
I came to serve a king!

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
The House of York.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
The house of our father,

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
who shed his blood
for our England.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
I cannot bring it to ruin.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
Come, Edward.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Before everyone, proclaim
yourself the rightful king!

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
Now, more than ever, I serve
as your faithful champion!

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD gasps]

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
My sweet brother!
Such stirring words!

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Now, welcome more,
and ten times more beloved,

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
than if thou never hadst
deserved our hate.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
I-I'm sorry.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
We must make haste.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
Warwick is raising
troops everywhere.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
We should slip between
their lines while we can,

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
and reach the capital
before they do.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
They've left Henry
alone in the palace.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Once we enter
the city, he's ours.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
So we're bound for London?

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
The plan is to head south

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
after we've gathered some
more troops in York.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Now that George once again
fights alongside us,

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
more men should
flock to our banner.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] I've a request
for you, my lord.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
With all due respect,
please leave Henry to me.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] If you were
to come across Henry.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT D]
Mister Catesby!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
Lord Hastings is
calling for you.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
Please return to your master.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
Your mission with me
has long since ended.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It will be by my own hands.

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
I am Edward Plantagenet
of House York.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
I am also this country's
rightful king!

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll strike Henry down,

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
and avenge Father's death!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
So, you came to see me.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
I wonder, have I
been a bad king?

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
Please give me your

Did my mercy not dry
all of their tears?

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
I wasn't greedy enough to
take their wealth from them.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
I did not want them to
suffer because of me.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
I-I never wanted to be king.
Not even a little.

Tell me plain!
Where is King Henry?

How am I supposed
to know that?

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
Until just mere moments ago,

Your Grace!

take you prisoner!

[BUCKINGHAM] Killing Henry
at this point in time

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center

Act too rashly,
