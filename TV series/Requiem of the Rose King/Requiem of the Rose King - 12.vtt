and next his throat unto
the butcher's knife.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] For the reckless
shepherd is already gone.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] You may no
longer remember anything,

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
but I remember
every last detail.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
That day, when I first met you,

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
I broke free from the dark,
and you were there.

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
You always appeared
without warning,

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
be it to heal my wounds,
or rip them wide open.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
I was tormented by
my own feelings.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
I longed for you with no
guarantee we would meet.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
Curse you.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
I loathed your very soul, yet
without knowing, I fell for you.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
I thought of giving
up everything...

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] ...if it meant
I could live with you.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I had a dream.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
A foolish dream.

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
But every trace of
it has vanished now.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Nothing remains...

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
...except for my sin.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
So you're...?

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
This body is the sin
that's burdened me 

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
since the day of my birth.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
You see... I am not a man.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
But neither am I a woman.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:29.309 position:50% align:center
I was born with two sexes.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
I tell this truth to you alone.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
Only you shall
witness my true form.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
The real me.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Dear God, please.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
Please...

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
Henry, will you...
love me, please?

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
Commit this sin, and together...

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
...we'll descend to hell.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
[PRIEST A]
Now confess, dear child.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] Countless times
I have dreamed of them.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
Those eyes.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center
Hair.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
Lips.

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
Warmth.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
I've never had these thoughts
or felt like this for anybody.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
His presence is my salvation.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
He's my most cherished friend,
but at some point along the way,

00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
I somehow found him striking.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
His beauty blinds me.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
These thoughts have
a strong hold.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
They make me suffer,

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
but I'm powerless to stop it!

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
I-I want to touch him!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
I want nothing more than
to take all he has to give!

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[MALE FOREST VOICE A]
What treason is this?

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE FOREST VOICE B]
What terrible sin!

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
Blasphemy indeed!

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
[MALE FOREST VOICE A] Your body
is brimming with lust and greed!

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE FOREST VOICE A]
Your wanton mother sowed

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
her impure seeds.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
You taint God with the
very blood you bleed!

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
Henry. Our God is
merciful and forgiving.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
There's not a sin in this
world that wasn't instigated

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.311 position:50% align:center
by a demon.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
You merely fell victim to
one demon in particular.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.610 position:50% align:center
It deceived you and led
you astray with its flesh.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
My obscene nightmares.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
Suffering.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
Hatred.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
Impulses.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
Lust.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
[CATHERINE]
Good boy. Very good.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center

Get away!

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
H-Henry.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Leave me be.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
Don't come closer, demon.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
Stay away!

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
I... thought...

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] The prophet
said when you were born,

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
a whirlwind laid trees low.

[HENRY]
The night owl screeched.

All birds let out a crow.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
Stop it.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
To herald in an age of
calamity and misfortune!

[FOREST VOICES]
Richard!

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
She felt a mother's pain,

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
yet brought forth less
than a mother's hope!

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
For after all the
terror that was held,

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
she bore an undigested
and deformed lump!

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
Not like the fruit of
such a godly tree!

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
Just a blood-soaked demon!

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center

loved ones to your blade,

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center

Silence.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center

Silence.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] "Why was he ever born?"

Yield day to night!
King Henry the Sixth!

Fair England never lost
a king of so much worth!

Comets, change of times,
brandish your crystal tresses

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
in the sky and scourge
the revolting stars

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
that brought our

My most beloved brother.

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
And your beautiful wife,

Has your sister been
well as of late?

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
Your Majesty is too kind.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
Words cannot express
my gratitude.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
As for my lady sister,

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid she is still
unwell due to her distress.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
But set your mind at ease.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
We shall tend to Anne
and the Neville Estate

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
while handling both
with the utmost care.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
How wonderful to hear.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
There are a great many with
their sights set on the

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
Earl of Warwick's vast fortune,
as you know.

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
So do see to it that no rogue
entraps your sweet sister.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thank you, Your Grace.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
I shall take care.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE] Especially when it
comes to upstart, minor nobles.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] I won't let
that woman's relatives

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
control the royal family.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
Your inheritance and
Anne's combined

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
is quite the status boost.

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
I match the king with
my current power.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
And to that end,

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
we need to ensure that your
sister stays in our grasp.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBJECT B]
He was murdered?

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
That's awful!

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBJECT C]
It's the talk of the town.

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
They're saying the
Duke of Gloucester

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
ran King Henry through.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
I've seen him on the
battlefield with my own eyes.

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Struck the Earl of Warrick down.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
Warrick tried to run,
but the duke was out of mercy.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBJECT B] That doesn't
surprise me in the least.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
Oh, Isabelle.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
I'm not "Isabelle" to you.

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
You should call me
"Your Grace", Anne.

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
Ah, pardon me.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
For some reason I called
you my elder sister's name.

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
No idea why, since you're
merely a stable hand.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
Of course, Your Grace,
I--I'm terribly sorry.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
My health's been a
little poor lately.

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
Stay sick as long as you like,
since it helps me

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
stave off the men who
come to court you.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
They just want you
for your inheritance,

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
so I can't have you
meeting them anyway.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Do you understand?

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
I'm keeping what's left
of my family safe.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] After that battle,
I was the only one pardoned.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
I couldn't keep
anything safe in the end.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] But perhaps there's
one last thing I can do.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
How tragic.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
Those wounds won't heal
if she remains on her own.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
You speak of Anne Neville?

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] We should
help her marry soon.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
I know the pain of
widowhood all too well,

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
so her plight worries me.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] Almost as much
as her immense wealth

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
being in George's
hands worries me.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] At least, for the
sake of the Lancasters,

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
I'll see the red
rose put to rest.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Please wait!

I beg you, please, allow me
to mourn King Henry's passing!

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lower the casket.

[RICHARD] Pardon me,
Lady Anne of House Neville.

[ANNE]
Richard. How could you?

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]
King Henry!

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
You truly think
Henry's in there?

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
That we would exhibit a
body covered in gashes

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
from head to toe?

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
Please tell me.
Was he... slain by you?

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
Aye.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
--[ANNE] And my father?
--Warwick fell by my hand.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
I killed your husband, too.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
In his final moments,
Edward lay bound and sobbing.

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
--So I took my blade and--
--[ANNE] Stop!

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I've been feeling
strange for some time.

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
You think your family will
gallantly protect you?

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
All they want to protect is your
wealth and their ties to it.

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
Eventually, you'll become
nothing but an obstacle to them.

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
They're eagerly awaiting
your death, even as we speak.

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]
Demon.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
The Lord Richard that
I knew is dead.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
He had a kind and noble soul,
but a demon must have stolen it.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Allow me to confess, Lady Anne.

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:58.610 position:50% align:center
It has come to this,
because I fell in love.

00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
My love for you
is what drove me.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
Richard!

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.332 position:50% align:center
I've found a reward for your
clandestine task you'll enjoy.

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:15.210 position:50% align:center
--Marriage to Anne Neville.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:18.338 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You were the light of my life.

00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:23.009 position:50% align:center
I searched for you always,
in dreams and reality.

00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:25.595 position:50% align:center
To undertake the death
of all the world,

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:28.890 position:50% align:center
so I might live one
hour in your embrace.

00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:31.810 position:50% align:center
I would slaughter
everyone with a smile.

00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:34.479 position:50% align:center
This also benefits the
royal family, of course.

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:37.816 position:50% align:center
So what say you, brother?

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:39.067 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
If I cannot convince you,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.278 position:50% align:center
I'll lend you this blade.

00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:44.948 position:50% align:center
Bury it... in my heart.

00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:47.325 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD laughs]

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:48.702 position:50% align:center
Liar.

00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:50.870 position:50% align:center
'Tis no lie.

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:54.207 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Tell me the truth.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:58.753 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Anne. I want
you to marry me.

00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:04.092 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I fear his heart
and words are empty.

00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:06.219 position:50% align:center
I'm certain.

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.138 position:50% align:center
After all...

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:12.434 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Richard is dead.

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:18.773 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Died alone
in the woods that day.
