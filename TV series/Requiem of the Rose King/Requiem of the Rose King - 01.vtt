In defiance of reason,

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
the House of Lancaster
still clings to the throne.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
The same throne they wrongfully
usurped from the House of York.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
[YORK] Indeed. My father
was executed for treason,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
and our once great house
plunged into dishonor.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Since the beginning,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
Your Grace's blood has
run far more noble

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
than that of the king.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
Your claim to the throne
is iron where his is tin.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
So, Warwick, am I destined
to become the king?

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
I swear on this white rose.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center
That I shall put
you on the throne,

a tempest on this land.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
To put the golden
circlet in my hand.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The golden circlet?

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.245 position:50% align:center

alongside you, Father.

I know.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll hold the same

Father is my light.

These royal houses
with their flowered

That's quite enough.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center

Parliament strongly
favored his petition

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center

No, not while Henry lives.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
He's still recognized
as the king.

[RICHARD]
If that's the case, Father...

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
...we should execute Henry
and put an end to all of this.

We shouldn't act so rashly.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
We must proceed with caution
until parliament recognizes

Well... actually.
I really can't dance either.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
I'd much rather spend my time
practicing swordsmanship.

than dancing, too!

Uh. Well, you're not
so normal yourself.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
There's something different.

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:39.906 position:50% align:center
Something that makes you stand
apart from everyone else.

wrong idea, Richard.
