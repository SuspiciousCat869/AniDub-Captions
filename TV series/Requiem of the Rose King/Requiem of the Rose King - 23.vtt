00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center line:84%
The king may very well
fall if nothing is done.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY]
Hm.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE B] Lord
Stanley, should you make

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
your way to the southwest,
we'd be happy to accompany you.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOWARD]
My lords!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
You all must be well
prepared for battle.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why else would you be
idling in the hallway,

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
gossiping like hens.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now that you
mention it, Lord Howard,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must depart to
ready my forces!

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall marshal troops
as well. Good day.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOWARD] Ungrateful
fair-weather "friends."

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NORTHUMBERLAND]
Perhaps,

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
but considering this
string of rebellions...

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
How can you join in such talk?

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uneasiness continues
to haunt me.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ever since that last
skirmish with Buckingham,

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
the king has been
a shell of himself.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]
My health isn't improving.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that medicine to blame? Or?

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE A]
King Richard!

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE B]
King Richard!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FOREST VOICES]
Richard.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FOREST VOICES]
Richard!

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JOAN] Everybody's looking for
a chance to turn on you.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center line:84%
One rebellion after another.
A dying queen.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you lose your precious little
successor on top of it all,

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
you truly will lose everything.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even the crown you killed
your other half to protect.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
How is Her Majesty?

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
As of right now she's stable,

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
however the moment we fear
could come at any time.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Prince of Wales shows
symptoms of the same disease,

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
though it's not
confirmed if he has it.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM coughs]

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
Should you let that child go,

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll be letting your
future go as well.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I already know.
You think I wouldn't?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center line:84%
[JOAN]
Hmm.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
Although, there is one
inaccuracy in your assessment.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
What I sought to protect at
all costs wasn't the crown.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anne?

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Mother? Where are we going?

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
Away from that place.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center line:84%
The air of death hangs
heavy in those halls!

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
This is our only chance to flee!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, Mother, please! Let go!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE gasps]

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] Everyone
will worry, we should turn back.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE] Listen, Edward.
I'm... going to die soon.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Y-You're dying?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE] Yes, and once I'm gone,
the palace will be fraught

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
with people who wish
for you to join me.

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
All the more if
Richard loses his fight.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
The fate of a dethroned
king's son is to be executed

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
or imprisoned for
the rest of his days.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center line:84%
So we must go.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Anne! Wait!

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Father/

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD grunts]

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[ANNE] No!
--[RICHARD gasps]

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE] I'm sorry, but we
can't stay with you!

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
This place--
that palace is horrid!

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's nothing like I hoped for!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Anne...

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to go back. Way back!

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
To the person I was
before I met you!

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center line:84%
Before a thief named Richard
the Third stole my life from me!

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where are you going? Come back!

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE] I loved who I was told,
to further schemes.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center line:84%
My duty as a woman
barred my dreams.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE coughs]

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Anne.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
Release me.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know something, Richard?
I think... you're my curse.

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
And not because I loved you.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
My deep feelings weren't
what kept me bound.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
I convinced myself that I could
earn your love in return.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't even say I was
fettered by your affection.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center line:84%
The one who grew these
ensnaring briars... was me.

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:22.200 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] All this time,
and I never realized.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
Her every wish for love
nurtured briars to tie her down.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
You simply wanted to be loved.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I'm... so sorry.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE gasps

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right here and now.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let us cut through
those briars together.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Edward, I chose
a bloody path to walk

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
of my own free will.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no need for you to
shoulder the burden I bear.

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] But whatever
roads you choose to take,

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
know that I love you.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I shall protect you,
at all costs.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] As soon as
he's clear of the capital,

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
you are to announce the
Prince of Wales is dead.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to hold his
"funeral" before the war.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
This is... a letter from Anne.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is the seal unbroken?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
You think this charade
for the best?

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
An heir's death so too spells
death for a king's reign.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not to mention your queen
is about to pass as well.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Silence!

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're wrong.
She'll recover any day.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know that you know
she won't, Your Grace.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's why you're so driven
to grant her wish.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Her wishes are mine as well now.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here. Make sure Edward
receives this rose.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a memento of his father.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
Jane, take good care of Ed--

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. Take good care of
that nameless boy.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE sighs]

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
You mustn't enter, Your Majesty!

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
What if you catch
the queen's illness?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
Move aside! It's my right
as her husband!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
Richard.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Standing isn't
good for you, Anne.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center line:84%
You should lie down.

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was this right?

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
We didn't just lose that
sweet boy, did we?

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. Not at all.
He simply gained a new life.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center line:84%
[exhales]
Thank you.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Anne, no!

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's my time. And now
I can die in peace.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's nonsense, so stop.
You'll get well soon.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll have a banquet to
celebrate your recovery.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall even have a new
dress prepared for you.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
You should wear the dress.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
I rather like how
you look in one.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll don a gown, then.
I'll grant your every wish.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
For no mortal desire is beyond
the king's power to fulfill.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELIZABETH]
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am eternally grateful for
the boundless compassion

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
you've bestowed upon
my daughter and me.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
You even provided Elizabeth
with this lovely dress.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank my wife,
it was her wish.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, I had that gown
made with Anne in mind.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:33.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I'm sure she would be
pleased to see you wear it.

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BETH] Mother, how do you expect
me to look Uncle Richard

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the eye? You had me betrothed
to his enemy, remember?

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELIZABETH] An engagement is
not as final as marriage,

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center line:84%

will soon be dead.

That's why Richard
kept you around.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center line:84%
He desires your bloodline.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center line:84%
You lie!

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everything that I do is for
your happiness, Elizabeth.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you truly want to
return to the palace,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I shall accompany you.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all...

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
...you are the last
golden ray of hope I have

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
in this dark world.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BETH whimpers]
Uncle Richard!

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BETH sobs]

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
People can be so cruel,
but I won't believe a word,

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center line:84%
no matter how ill
they speak of you!

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD chuckles]

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
I sincerely pray that your life
has God's divine blessing.

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
May you live out your
full span of years

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
in peace and contentment.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
I also hope you know how much
my Edward cared for you.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELIZABETH]
Richard.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps you traded your
demonic horns for angel wings

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
and freed us out of the
goodness of your heart.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
But that whim may as
well be a shovel,

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
for all that you've done
is dig your own grave!

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHMOND] My name is
Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond!

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I have come to reclaim

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
the noble country of
England from you!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
My brave, earnest gentlemen!

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
I implore you, lend me your
strength so that I might defeat

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
and dethrone this demon king!

My dearest Lord Richard.

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you ever recall that
day at the banquet?

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center line:84%
When we danced?

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
You asked for my hand,
but I was so delighted,

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think I gave you
my heart by mistake.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
At times, I feel my
mind is not my own,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
for when I picture you, I soar
out of my darkest thoughts,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
like a skylark at dawn.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center line:84%
How I would love to dance
with you again someday,

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
given my heart does not burst.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center line:84%
Until that day comes,
and I truly hope it does,

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall pray for
your happiness. Always.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD coughs]

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Brave soldiers of England!

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
The traitor, Richmond,
now seeks to usurp the throne

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
that rightfully belongs
to the House of York!

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
He devastates our land in
his advance toward London!

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
But take heart, for our
foes are beaten curs

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
who once fled this
country in defeat!

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
A common thorn holds more
power to wound us,

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
so we must stand firm as
the shield of our fatherland!

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
In the name of your righteous
and true king, march onward!

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] It matters not if God
has chosen to watch over

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richmond and his men.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
For there's nothing left
to me that he can take,

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
not even a briar.
I cut them all.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE YORKIST SOLDIER A]
What are you doing? Make way!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY] Impertinent wretch!
Do you know to whom you speak?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center line:84%
I gave birth to the one
that you fools call "king!"

[gasps]

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Have you, by chance,

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
come to pray for
victory in battle?

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, I have indeed.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
For Richmond's victory,
of course.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I see. Then kindly
stand aside, Mother.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're marching! Beat the drums!

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY] Richard. The infernal
day you were born...

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE FOREST VOICE A]
A whirlwind laid trees low.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center line:84%
The night owl screeched.
All birds let out a crow!

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FEMALE FOREST VOICE A] To
herald in an age of misfortune.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MALE FOREST VOICE A]
The mother suffered much, 

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
but her babe none!

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY] And after all the
terror that had been,

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center line:84%
the child was born
a demon rife with sin!

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] This voice that always
tormented me. It was yours.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yours all along.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY] Richard, you are
unfit to be king in more ways

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
than you realize.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
I should have been forthright
before it came to this.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
I should have
revealed our secret,

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
but my determination to
take it to my grave won out.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though better late than never.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your father wasn't Richard
Plantagenet, Duke of York.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have no more time to waste,

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
least of all on these
ravings of yours.

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY] Ten months and
ten days before your birth.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our strife with Lancaster was
reaching its peak, which in turn

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
caused my husband to be overcome
by rage and desperation.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
Between that pressure and
his lust for the crown,

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
he had no place for me.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I... succumbed.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center line:84%
You look nothing like
your father or brothers.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everything about you
is proof of my deed!

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
[sighs]

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
True. I do not resemble Father.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
How could I, when I so
clearly take after you?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY gasps]

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] You and I both clung
to what we could never have.

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
And then punished ourselves to
escape our senseless suffering.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
We took on the titles of
"sinners" and "demons"

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
to prevent our ever-growing
agony from suffocating us!

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're wrong!

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Mother. "Sinner" is
not the title you should bear.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center line:84%
For you... are a victim.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CECILY]
That's enough!

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
I am not so pathetic
to be a victim!

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
I committed the sin of
infidelity and your birth

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
was my punishment!

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though my husband always
loved me and stayed true,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center line:84%
the one thing he refused
to love was my darkness.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why couldn't he love
every part of me?

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
How slender and frail she is.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's small, like I am.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have I been under such a slight
person's sway all this time?

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Mother, I entreat
you to offer your prayers.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pray for Richmond's triumph.
And my death.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:36.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
It is my hope you find some
semblance of comfort in that.

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
For all my hatred.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
I, in truth, always...

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center line:84%
Always wanted your love.
