more spice, I think.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
How about some cinnamon, huh?
I'll grab a pinch!

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
It's quite late.
Should a devout shepherd

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
be partaking in a meal
this time of night?

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
Perhaps not... but I've had
nary a crumb since yesterday.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, we have
an understanding God.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. I thought you
were doing this as thanks

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
when really you
were just hungry.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] No, it was
out of thanks, I swear!

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it. Eat up
while you have the chance.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Right.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's really good.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] I've never had such
a delectable soup before.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Because a farmer's
soup is mostly beans, I'd wager.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
No. Not that.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
What made it taste so wonderful
was that I cooked it myself.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
You know I was the one who
did most of the cooking.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
Yes, that added to
the flavor, too.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
It was divine. Thank you.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Seems morning will come
before this rain lets up.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll lend you a room.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Wait, truly?

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I promised you could
stay until the rain stops.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
As soon as it's clear, gather
your things and leave.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What am I saying? I--

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] I don't suppose
we could share a bed?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Your room is down that way.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
Please, Richard. I want
to keep talking with you.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
It ends when I wake and the
thought of parting you pains me.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
Neither of us are children.
Go sleep by yourself.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No. This can't go on.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
If I spend another
moment with him...

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
I'm curious. What are your
favorite things in the world?

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
What foods do you love?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
Do you like music?
If so, what songs?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
What color do you like
to see the sky painted?

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'm confused as is.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
Don't make it worse
than you already have.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
It's pouring!

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
You sound so pleased.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Well, of course I am.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
Now you and I can
talk a little bit more.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD sighs] I'd rather not.
But a promise is a promise.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
Besides. I highly doubt Edward
will be back anytime soon.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
I like berries.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:42.846 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Huh?

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
They're my favorite food.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
I love their sweet taste, too!

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN UNDERLING A]
Prince Edward!

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
A man in the tavern claims
to have met King Henry.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Did he come off as
some lying drunkard?

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN UNDERLING A]
Not to me.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
Said he was looking for
a man named Richard.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
He said what?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
So you don't play
cards or chess?

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
How on earth do you
pass the time, then?

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
By crafting sundials?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to hear
you remember that.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
But sad to say I'm not fond
of competing with others.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
I'd much rather pass the
time by telling stories.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
I don't know any
more to tell, though.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Aw, not even a fairy tale?

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Maybe if I read as
much as my brother,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
I'd have a yarn to spin for you.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait. There's this one
about a demon child.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Mm.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
When that creature
came into the world,

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
a great tempest leveled
the trees of the land.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
The night crow cried out
to herald the coming

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
of a most misfortunate era.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
The child's mother suffered
abnormal birthing pains

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
and quickly grew to despise
her hideous offspring.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
The prophets said that one day,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
the people would cry,
"Why was this demon child born?"

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
and they'd all
pray for him to die.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
Was there not a soul among
them who showed him love?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
Some that approached
him in their ignorance,

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
but once his demonic
nature was revealed,

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
they left him as well.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
And what of the child?
Did he love anyone in the world?

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Only one person.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
Guess that wasn't
a very good tale, huh?

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.034 position:50% align:center
The end. Now no more stories.

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Richard.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
Wait, before you leave--!

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
I may have drank too much.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
I didn't see the bottom
of that goblet very often.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
What hold does your
presence have on me?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
You draw such shameful
things from my lips.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
No one else does this. Just you.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Well, we're friends, you and I.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Maybe, you are different.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
Richard, I just...

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
O Heavenly Father! Forgive me!

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
Henry? Are you all right?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
I-I'm sorry.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
The lightning flashes.
They frighten me.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I don't care
for lightning myself,

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
so... I'll share
your bed tonight.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You said I was your salvation.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
But I think the one being saved
by our encounters is me.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
If my father is here,
he may be in danger.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
There is not a moment
to be wasted!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
I shall scout ahead.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN UNDERLING B]
Your Highness, please wait!

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Why don't you wait instead?

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
We'll be noticed if we're many.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry?

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
Could it be true?
Is Richard within those walls?

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Being here like this with you.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
England could cease to
exist and I wouldn't care.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
You mustn't say such things.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
Love, question for you.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard the old
fable about the rich man's son?

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] In a faraway land,
there lived a prosperous father

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
who owned a book that
recorded the future.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
His son's destiny
was also spelled out

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
within its enchanted pages.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Much to the father's dismay,
it said the son would one day

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
marry the daughter
of a poor farmer

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
who lived by the cathedral.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] The father then
sought this girl out,

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
and tried again and again
to part her from his boy.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] But each time,
a miracle occurred,

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
and the two were
brought back together.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] The moral is no one
can defy the chains of fate

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
that bind them.

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
No! Richard!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Hey! Are you injured?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
Damn it! What do I do?

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]
Oh, thank God!

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Did you... just...?

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Look! I thought them gone!

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
But they're fine.
Not one got washed away.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
They're berries.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
I saw them growing thickly
on that bank over there.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
I picked them in secret and
planned on surprising you later.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
I see. So then,
you didn't leave.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
I told you before, Richard.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
You are my home and I shall
never stray far from you.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD, HENRY gasp]

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What... on earth...

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
...am I even thinking?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
Henry. You drive
me positively mad.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
Now I'm afraid I'm
going to lose...

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
...the answers I've gotten
and everything else.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
Even so, I find myself wishing
this rain would never end.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
We promised.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
Could you and I please
make another promise?

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
One that ensures we meet again?

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
So I can continue on knowing
I still have a home.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Don't submit.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
Another minute with him,
and you'll be lost.
