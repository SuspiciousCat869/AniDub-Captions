00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
Pardon me. There's someone
I'm desperately seeking out.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
What do they look like?

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
He's pale, thin,

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.979 position:50% align:center
and favors clothing
black as his hair.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER B]
And his name?

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
His name?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
He goes by the name of Richard.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
Does he live around here?

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] No. But I have
faith I'll find him.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The taste. And scent of blood.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
So alike, the act of loving
yields them as well.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD chuckles]

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
Richard, you already drunk?

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
A little. Or perhaps more.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Everyone's the same.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
Once my real self is known,
they all take flight.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Only the battlefield
will ease my plight.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
York of the white rose,

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
These royal houses with
their flowered crests

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.544 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.636 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET groans]
O merciful God in Heaven above.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50% align:center
Why, in your holy name, was I
ever led to marry that man?

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
All my misfortunes
stemmed from that!

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
I wish he would remain missing.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't wish
such things, Edward.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
It was only a
harmless joke, Mother.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
I know the restoration of
our family won't happen

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
without its leader.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50% align:center
Once the Lancaster
rights are restored,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
you'll be able to reclaim
your rights as well.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
That man. He renounced me
with the utmost ease.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
He's not a father or a king.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Ne'er would a proper
king ever disinherit

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
his own flesh and blood.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Yet that's what he did.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
Sobbing all the while.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
And his only excuse
Was that he "couldn't help it."

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
Father. I know him not
by that name. Not now.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Well then, if that's the case,

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
this is an order from the
one you know as Mother.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
You must retrieve
His Majesty, King Henry.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Why me--

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
You'll do this because
it would be a fatal blow

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
if he were to fall into
our enemy's hands.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
But still.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] If you insist
that he is not your father.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
Here's a chance
to prove it to me.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
Prove that unlike that
sniveling coward,

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
you can carry out your
duty with distinction.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Prove that you are
fit to be king.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
Show me you won't turn and run
at the first sign of adversity.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Very well.
I shall go and bring him back.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
For your sake, Mother.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
Do not mistake this
act as love for him.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] You're going on yet
another hunt with Edward?

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
He's been enamored with the
sport since that first trip.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
Very true.
Quite "enamored," yes.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
Losing our contest has put
a serious dent in his pride.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
I guess you're teaching him now!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
I just accompany him,
simple as that.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT A]
Lord Richard!

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
A letter for Your Grace.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
Leave it in my
chambers for now.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
We'll be home soon, George.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
Farewell.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
Huh. I wonder if Anne
is the one writing him.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT A] One for
you as well, Lord George.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
The sender is Lady Isabelle!

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps] Quiet!
There is no need to shout!

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I wish it
were as simple as that.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I only come along to
preserve His Majesty's secret.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
I'm off to see Elizabeth.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
You, my brother,
will truly hunt.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
And if anyone poses a question,
you'll tell them I was with you.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
Is there a point
to this pretense?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center
Surely you know you'll
eventually be found out.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
Of course, I'm well aware.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
I am not fool enough
to think our love

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
can stay hidden forever.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
That's why...
I have decided to act

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
before future
complications arise.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD exhales]

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
While our secret remains untold,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
I intend to make my
dear Elizabeth my wife.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
I would call that a jest,
but I know better.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
I am ever the most
serious fellow.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
I've had many a woman, Richard.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
I have the utmost confidence
I'll never again taste anything

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
as sweet as what
I've shared with her.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
If I were to let her go,

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
I know I would regret
it as long as I live.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
Brother. Recognize how
complicit you are in this.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Does love make people
as blind as Edward is now?

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The king of a country,

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
eloping with a minor
noble's widow?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
Complications are inevitable.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What nonsense.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
He speaks as though he's
found an invaluable treasure

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
in that whore.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
One worth more than the coveted
crown our father died for.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] But meeting you
here tonight... has brought me

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
much closer to paradise
than any crown ever could.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This isn't that forest.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
No reason he'd be here.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
That meeting was our last.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I will never again see his face.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No. Our two paths...

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
...should never cross again.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
I've really found you.
You're here.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
Somehow I knew God would
unite us once again.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] That faith is
what kept me going.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
[HENRY laughs]
Have you been well?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Why does this always happen?

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
He just appears without warning!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What are you even doing here?

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
I had hoped you'd want to
come back to these woods.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
That world's yours.
My world's on another plane.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
Return to your sheep
and leave me be.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
I would, but a
shepherd I am not.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
I'm a traveler now.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
And my travels have led
me in search of you.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
You see, you are
my home, Richard.

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I don't understand.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
Where does your obsession
with me come from?

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
It's Because... my salvation
was you all this time!

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I... was your salvation? Me?

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
Through those harsh days of war,
I only found comfort with you.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
So please, Richard.
Let me stay, if for a moment.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD sighs]
Until the rain stops.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'll give you
a fresh set of clothes.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
I take it that you
are living alone?

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
You wish to know of my lineage?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. What you
are is no concern.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
I like the person you are,
not the status you bear.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Liar.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
If you knew the real me, your
view would undoubtedly shift.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What now?

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
You ought to get out of
your wet clothes, too.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
Please, so you
don't catch a cold.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD grunts]

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
I'll fetch you dry clothes.
Just wait right there.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Though he has
feminine tendencies,

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
his body is that of a man's.
Of course it would be.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
But I'm different.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
No matter how fiercely I train,
my marks of womanhood remain.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Binding my chest,

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
can't bind the truth
that lies within.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Huh?

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
What's this? Did I not
tell you to stay put?

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
Yes, I recall.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
But, I thought my time was
better spent making us dinner.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
I haven't had real
food in a long time!

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
Don't get too excited,
since we're such novice chefs.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
It could use
more spice, I think.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
How about some cinnamon, huh?
I'll grab a pinch!

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
It's quite late.
Should a devout shepherd

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
be partaking in a meal
this time of night?

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
Perhaps not... but I've had
nary a crumb since yesterday.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, we have
an understanding God.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. I thought you
were doing this as thanks

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
when really you
were just hungry.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] No, it was
out of thanks, I swear!

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it. Eat up
while you have the chance.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Right.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's really good.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] I've never had such
a delectable soup before.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Because a farmer's
soup is mostly beans, I'd wager.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
No. Not that.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
What made it taste so wonderful
was that I cooked it myself.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
You know I was the one who
did most of the cooking.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
Yes, that added to
the flavor, too.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
It was divine. Thank you.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Seems morning will come
before this rain lets up.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll lend you a room.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Wait, truly?

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I promised you could
stay until the rain stops.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
As soon as it's clear, gather
your things and leave.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What am I saying? I--

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
[HENRY] I don't suppose
we could share a bed?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Your room is down that way.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
Please, Richard. I want
to keep talking with you.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
It ends when I wake and the
thought of parting you pains me.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
Neither of us are children.
Go sleep by yourself.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No. This can't go on.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
If I spend another
moment with him...

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
I'm curious. What are your
favorite things in the world?

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
What foods do you love?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
Do you like music?
If so, what songs?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
What color do you like
to see the sky painted?

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'm confused as is.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
Don't make it worse
than you already have.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
It's pouring!

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
You sound so pleased.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Well, of course I am.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
Now you and I can
talk a little bit more.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD sighs] I'd rather not.
But a promise is a promise.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
Besides. I highly doubt Edward
will be back anytime soon.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
I like berries.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:42.846 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Huh?

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
They're my favorite food.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
I love their sweet taste, too!

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN UNDERLING A]
Prince Edward!

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
A man in the tavern claims
to have met King Henry.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Did he come off as
some lying drunkard?

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN UNDERLING A]
Not to me.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
Said he was looking for
a man named Richard.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
He said what?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
So you don't play
cards or chess?

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
How on earth do you
pass the time, then?

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
By crafting sundials?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to hear
you remember that.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
But sad to say I'm not fond
of competing with others.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
I'd much rather pass the
time by telling stories.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
I don't know any
more to tell, though.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Aw, not even a fairy tale?

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Maybe if I read as
much as my brother,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
I'd have a yarn to spin for you.

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait. There's this one
about a demon child.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Mm.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
When that creature
came into the world,

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
a great tempest leveled
the trees of the land.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
The night crow cried out
to herald the coming

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
of a most misfortunate era.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
The child's mother suffered
abnormal birthing pains

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
and quickly grew to despise
her hideous offspring.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
The prophets said that one day,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
the people would cry,
"Why was this demon child born?"

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
and they'd all
pray for him to die.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
Was there not a soul among
them who showed him love?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
Some that approached
him in their ignorance,

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
but once his demonic
nature was revealed,

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
they left him as well.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
And what of the child?
Did he love anyone in the world?

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Only one person.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
Guess that wasn't
a very good tale, huh?

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.034 position:50% align:center
The end. Now no more stories.

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Richard.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
Wait, before you leave--!

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
I may have drank too much.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
I didn't see the bottom
of that goblet very often.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
What hold does your
presence have on me?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
You draw such shameful
things from my lips.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
No one else does this. Just you.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Well, we're friends, you and I.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Maybe, you are different.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
Richard, I just...

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
O Heavenly Father! Forgive me!

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
Henry? Are you all right?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
I-I'm sorry.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
The lightning flashes.
They frighten me.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I don't care
for lightning myself,

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
so... I'll share
your bed tonight.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You said I was your salvation.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
But I think the one being saved
by our encounters is me.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
If my father is here,
he may be in danger.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
There is not a moment
to be wasted!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
I shall scout ahead.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN UNDERLING B]
Your Highness, please wait!

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Why don't you wait instead?

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
We'll be noticed if we're many.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.595 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry?

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
Could it be true?
Is Richard within those walls?

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Being here like this with you.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
England could cease to
exist and I wouldn't care.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
You mustn't say such things.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
Love, question for you.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard the old
fable about the rich man's son?

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] In a faraway land,
there lived a prosperous father

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
who owned a book that
recorded the future.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
His son's destiny
was also spelled out

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
within its enchanted pages.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Much to the father's dismay,
it said the son would one day

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
marry the daughter
of a poor farmer

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
who lived by the cathedral.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] The father then
sought this girl out,

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
and tried again and again
to part her from his boy.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] But each time,
a miracle occurred,

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
and the two were
brought back together.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] The moral is no one
can defy the chains of fate

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
that bind them.

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
No! Richard!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Hey! Are you injured?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
Damn it! What do I do?

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Henry?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]
Oh, thank God!

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Did you... just...?

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Look! I thought them gone!

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
But they're fine.
Not one got washed away.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
They're berries.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
I saw them growing thickly
on that bank over there.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
I picked them in secret and
planned on surprising you later.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
I see. So then,
you didn't leave.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
I told you before, Richard.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
You are my home and I shall
never stray far from you.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD, HENRY gasp]

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What... on earth...

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
...am I even thinking?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
Henry. You drive
me positively mad.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
Now I'm afraid I'm
going to lose...

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
...the answers I've gotten
and everything else.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
Even so, I find myself wishing
this rain would never end.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
We promised.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
Could you and I please
make another promise?

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
One that ensures we meet again?

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
So I can continue on knowing
I still have a home.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Don't submit.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
Another minute with him,
and you'll be lost.

Not as much as you'll regret
your marriage, brother.

soul bid me to love.
