[PRINCE EDWARD]
What say you, Anne?

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
Don't you think my heroic
figure will impress her?

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
I cannot speak for Lord Richard,

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
but what is it about him
that appeals to you?

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center
Fair question. Her strong
will is admirable.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
And I adore her charming face.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
But you're foes.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
She'll still be mine, for a
king can have who he chooses.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
It's strange. She hasn't
given me the time of day,

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
but that appeals to me, too.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
I also have a question.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.263 position:50% align:center
Do you hate your father?

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center
For how, um, things turned out?

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
No, I don't hate him.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
It's God's plan.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.608 position:50% align:center
How the Lord wove
our threads of fate.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.985 position:50% align:center
"The Lord?" Are you serious?

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
Don't just blindly put
your faith in God

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
and accept whatever
life gives you!

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center
If you truly
want something,

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
then take it with
your own strength!

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
You can't have Richard, though.

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
[ANNE laughs]

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
I never expected to
hear that from you.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.961 position:50% align:center
What's so funny?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
Women are at their best when
they have a bit of spark.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:30.757 position:50% align:center
That's a certainty.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.384 position:50% align:center
You know, Edward.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.679 position:50% align:center
I can tell, even if we never
really love each other,

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.139 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we can still
grow as friends.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
You think us friends?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
I do. So would you be up for
a friendly game of chess?

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.024 position:50% align:center
I'm rather hopeless
at embroidery.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
York of the white rose,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.160 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:06.126 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.837 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:16.636 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
The fog has grown quite thick.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The end is nigh.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
I will take down Lancaster

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
and venge father's
death in this battle!

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A]
King Edward!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD grunts]

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
No flourish of trumpets?
He dares scorn us!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Warwick.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
Seems you've mistaken
your path in this fog.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
I fear the mistaken
one here is you.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
At least if you intend to oppose
us with such paltry forces.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
You mistreat ambassadors
and scoff at diplomacy.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
You aren't satisfied
with one woman,

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
and you can't even contrive
to defend yourself.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
Such unstable shoulders
should not bear

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
the weight of a kingdom.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
Your own family knew as much
and forsook you as I have!

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
And here he comes now.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center
George of Clarence sweeps along,

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
leading a force large enough
to bid his brother battle.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
Albeit late.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
Did the queen's forces
arrive as scheduled?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
Appears you were mistaken.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
You thought George cold enough
to bend the instruments of war 

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
against his kin and lawful king.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
Warwick! Hear me!

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
Though I did cross my brother,

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
I have fully repented for
those transgressions,

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
and hereby denounce you as my
mortal foe to earn his trust!

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
Behold, our forces
are evenly matched.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
Thus, I'll return the wounds
you inflicted on this heart

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
a hundred-fold!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
You're going to pay.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] If Henry made good
his escape from London,

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
he could be in that army.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center

Are we to fight like this?

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
I can't see!

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center

Follow me!

My sight's not hindered at all.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
I see the red blood of
Lancaster clear as day!

[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
Your Majesty,

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
until this contest is resolved,
I beg you remain concealed

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
away from the Earl
of Warwick's host.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
[HENRY gasps]
Please, God! Hear my prayer!

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
May whoever you favor
find victory on this day.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
No, wait. I don't wish for a
single soul to come to harm.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
Nobody.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
Your Grace!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
I'm a fool. I thought
I was a just king.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
I have always believed
that my heart

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
was with the hearts
of my people.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
However, I kept averting
my gaze from reality,

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
from everyone's real wounds.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
I must witness it.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
Watch over them all properly.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
As a king, I must see its end.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center

Lord Richard!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
This fog is too thick.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
Richard!

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No good.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
If we attack our
allies by mistake,

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
fear and suspicion
could lead to a rout.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
Lord Buckingham.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
You stay here and
halt the soldiers.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
Do so as "Richard".

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
So, what am I doing?

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
Listen. From this point onward,

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
this man is me, and you
are to assist him.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.612 position:50% align:center
--[YORKIST SOLDIER C] Yes, sir!
--[BUCKINGHAM] Wait!

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
Richard. You don't intend
to charge in alone, do you?

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
I won't be alone.
I'll have my comrades.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
What, comrades?

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
The enemy keeps on
matching our every move.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
But if this battle
drags on too long,

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
their ranks will be reinforced.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
Edward. I shall go join the
fight alongside Richard.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
Think, George.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.804 position:50% align:center
You could lose Isabelle forever
should you slay her father.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
But still!

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
We both agreed that
your place is beside me.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
I'll handle Warwick,
you need not stray.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
Patience. We'll wait for
some blow to turn the tide.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Warwick's banner.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
So the main force
is over that way.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
What're you doing?

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
I can see the enemy,
but they haven't noticed us yet!

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
They're right there,
beyond the fog!

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
We can take them by surprise!

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
Any cowards can stay here.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
I'm off to claim my glory!

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER A]
Wait for me!

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER C]
Let's go!

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center
Don't let this chance slip!

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Yes.
Follow me, Lancastrian dogs.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER D]
Huh? Are those our men?

[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIER E groans]

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center

Attack!

[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIERS shout]

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center

Shatter to pieces!

[LANCASTRIAN MESSENGER A]
Lord Warrick!

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
The rear of our main line!

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
It's collapsed! It's gone!

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
How is that? Did York
get reinforcements?

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN MESSENGER A]
No, my lord.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
It seems our men confused one
another for enemies in the fog.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
Slaying their allies?
What a pleasant turn!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
It appears Heaven
sides with us, after all!

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
Gentlemen! Surely you
can feel victory!

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
It's within our grasp,
so let's act now and take it!

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
For the House of York!

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
Crush them all! Charge!

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
Damn this infernal fog!

[gasps]

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center

be besting me just yet.

Still, you do have talent.

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'm positive that
wasn't my imagination!

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
Over here, Richard.

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
Right this way.
Henry is very close.

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
What makes you think
for even half a second

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
I would believe you?
Stop wasting my time.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
You'd waste less
time if you listened.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
I'll show you the path.

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
Don't want to keep your
beloved Henry waiting.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
[JOAN]
Hm? Is that not right?

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Ah, so King Henry the Sixth
is who you're seeking.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
But it seems your beloved
Henry is waiting for you

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
as well in the exact same spot!

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
[JOAN] Come on.
I'll take you to Henry

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
regardless of which
one you want to see.

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
Richard. Stop.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
Don't lend the witch your ear.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
Her only purpose is to confuse
you at a crucial time.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.155 position:50% align:center
You'll find the king
beyond that grove.

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
Should you follow her,

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
your last chance to slay
Henry will be lost.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
Go and avenge me, my son.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Secure the throne for York!

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
I'm not lying.
I've nothing to gain.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
Let's go see Henry together.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
Listen to me.
Have faith in my words.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
In order to strike
down the king,

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
trust only the voice
of your father!

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
Time's wasting, you know.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
Joan of Arc.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
Yes, Richard?

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
Go! Begone, fiend!

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
But, Richard...

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who
knows the real you.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
No one else.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
Watch, Father.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
I will find Henry and avenge
you with my own two hands.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
Now swear it to me.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
Like you did then.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
Please, I beseech you!

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
Guide me. Give me wings!

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
And we'll soar to King Henry!

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
You need to flee

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
while you still can,
Your Majesty!

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
Why did this man lose his life?

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
Or that boy?

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
If I were not present,
neither of them would have died.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
I'm to blame.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Almost there.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
Once I've slain the king,
I'll go to our forest, Henry.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
Wait for me.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
I like the person you are,
not the status you bear.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Exactly.

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
No matter who you might be,
it doesn't change how I feel.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
Come again?

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER D] Unless my
eyes are deceiving me,

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
I saw King Henry!

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
He was just down that way.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
He's on the field?

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard, wait!

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
I killed them.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
Not just today.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
I've <i>been</i> killing them.

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
We must make haste, sire!

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Names and stations be damned.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center
You're my light, Henry.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'll kill the king.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
And once it's done...

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
Once he's dead...

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I'll find you,
and illuminate my world.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Why are you here?

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
I could ask the same.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
Who are you? Truly?

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] My name...
is Richard Plantagenet.

00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
I'm a duke, and of
the House of York.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
Richard the Second
was my Father,

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
whom the Lancastrians
brutally killed.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.995 position:50% align:center
Your turn, Henry.

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:19.214 position:50% align:center
I am... The king of this land.
