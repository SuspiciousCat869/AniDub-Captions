You're currently a
prisoner in my custody.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Once we can join up
with Mother's army,

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
we'll be leaving this place.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
So Margaret's forces
are advancing?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
Then exactly how far have
they managed to get?

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
You honestly don't
know anything?

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
So your father's fate is also
unbeknownst to you?

[PRINCE EDWARD grunts]

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
What about my father's fate?
Did something happen to him?

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Well, all I know is he's being
held in the city of York.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
Too far for you to go alone.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
I'd be willing to accompany you.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
Only if you agree
to stay with me.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
Why accomplish this by attaching
myself to a Lancaster?

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
If I wish to go greet my father,

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
it will be in the company
of my own family!

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
Heh. According to all
the gossip I heard,

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
your mother took your
brother and has already fled.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
They are gone.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
I should have presumed as much.
She's abandoned me before.

Our troops are taking the area!

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I've been forsaken.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
I'm worthless as a hostage,
so why try to stop me?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
But there's something
in me telling me I should.

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it has something to
do with you being a woman.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I am no woman.
My father called me his son.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
He named me Richard.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
Most of all the
citizens have fled.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Remain calm
and think this through.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
It's a long way to York, and
you're in dire need of a horse.

If Lancaster has taken the town,

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
getting out will
be no easy feat.

you are even from this town.

to turn up at a time like this?

How've you passed the
days since we last met?

Such selfish words.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
Not that you asked, but I made
up my mind to go it alone.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
I have to go alone, and yet...!

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
What? Go where? Wait, Richard!

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
Let go! Time is of
the essence, so I can't--

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
And I want to come, too!
Let me join you at your side.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center

I just want to be with you.

fruit and tending sheep,

time with the church bells.

You think me suffering
from some fatal wound,

different from you.

If you're not in pain, Richard,

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center

Puts one in the most

would've wrest the crown--

You should speak
less of such things!

It's horrible to think about!

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center

did he lose succession?

enemies frightens them.

I had no choice!

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
There was nothing I could do.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center

no blood would be spilled.

dear William.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
You left me with no one to
embrace, and made sure you had

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
my heart with you before
you departed for heaven.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
