[YORK] The Lancastrian queen
Margaret has taken up sword.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
Though the north
bows before her,

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
the conqueror shall
soon be the conquered.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
For I, too, will march
north to stay her blade.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
I beseech you, Edward.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
Ride west and take charge
of the Welsh border.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
Aye.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
And you, Earl of Warwick.
Defend London in my stead.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
Aye, Sire.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Father! Grant me
your blessing to join!

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
I won't hinder you!

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
Richard...

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
Is that a yes?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
[CECILY] My love!
Please leave Richard!

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
Don't take him away.
I loathe the thought of him

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
dashing into a
bloodstained battlefield.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.356 position:50% align:center
[CECILY] I know he's destined
to go off to war someday,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
but he's so delicate.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
This slim body still needs
the arms of its mother.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
Have pity on a
foolish woman's whim!

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
I beg you.
Please leave him with me!

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
[YORK] Richard, I shall
return to you anon.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
Until then, I trust you'll
protect your mother.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
He left me...

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.470 position:50% align:center
[CECILY]
As long as I draw breath,

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center
I will never let you go to him.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
Your mere presence in his
life is far more dangerous

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.893 position:50% align:center
than any battle.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
Every word that seeps
from your mouth

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.772 position:50% align:center
is a curse that brings
others to ruin.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
You'll devour their souls,
won't you?

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
For how else could a filthy
demon child survive this world?

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
O Lord in heaven,

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
give me the power to guard
them all from this devil.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
And may that good deed
serve as my atonement

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
for bestowing the sacred gift of
life to such a heinous creature!

York of the white rose,

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
and Lancaster of the red.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:15.176 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.887 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
Their stronghold is nigh,
so do not falter!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
Keep your weapons at the ready!

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
Fortune favors us!

[YORKIST SOLDIERS]
For York!

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
[YORK] Surely more men fought
under Margaret's banner

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
than this.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A]
They probably saw our great army

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
and ran away in fear.

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
[YORK] Something's amiss.
How can our enemy number so few?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET chuckles]

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
It's almost Christmas, isn't it?

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
I suppose an elaborate
family celebration

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
is out of the question,
all things considered.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
Speaking of our family,
where has Richard gone?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen him as of late.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
Oh, I sent that boy somewhere
I knew he'd be safe.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
The Tower.

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
Are there prisoners
being held here?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
Ones other than me?

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST GUARD A]
Goodness, no!

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
This keep is only for
noble personages!

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
Noble like who? Good King Henry?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Of course. Henry must be here.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
Curse the locks
that bar my escape.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
If I were free,

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
I'd kill him and race to
Father's side with his head!

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] York was
quite a disappointment.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
Is this all he amounts to
without Warwick and Edward?

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
Hurry! You must flee, my liege!

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
Sacrificing my men
to save my life?

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
That's not the way of a king!

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST FOLLOWER A]
But, Your Majesty!

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
I swore to stand my ground.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
It's either a crown...
or a glorious tomb!

A king...

...holds his ground.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
He stands firm...
till the very end!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center

Richard, I swore it to you!

Look, son.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
When we pass 'neath
this bit of tree,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
I'll kiss you and
you'll kiss me.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
At least that's how
the saying goes.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
Is that really true?

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
I could kiss Mother and
she wouldn't get mad?

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
Of course she won't.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
The custom also states you must
do this 12 times, if I recall.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
You could still kiss
her after me.

Oh, good. You're still alive.

[YORK]
Why not be done with it?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
We both know I only have
embers of life left.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] But those embers
should be just enough

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
to keep your heart beating
while I disgrace you.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
Put this on.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
I weaved it specially
to fit your pretty head.

Lovely, yes?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.351 position:50% align:center
You desired the crown enough

and now it's right here.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
It suits you
remarkably well, York!

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
Come, lords, bow to your king!

[MARGARET laughs]

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
You begged for me to
put an end to you,

secure a parting gift for you,

You're currently a
prisoner in my custody.

Once we can join up
with Mother's army,

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
we'll be leaving this place.

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
So Margaret's forces
are advancing?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
Then exactly how far have
they managed to get?

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
You honestly don't
know anything?

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center

unbeknownst to you?

[PRINCE EDWARD grunts]

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
What about my father's fate?
Did something happen to him?

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Well, all I know is he's being
held in the city of York.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
Too far for you to go alone.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
I'd be willing to accompany you.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
Only if you agree
to stay with me.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
Why accomplish this by attaching
myself to a Lancaster?

If I wish to go greet my father,

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
it will be in the company
of my own family!

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
Heh. According to all
the gossip I heard,

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
your mother took your
brother and has already fled.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
They are gone.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
I should have presumed as much.
She's abandoned me before.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I've been forsaken.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
I'm worthless as a hostage,
so why try to stop me?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
But there's something
in me telling me I should.

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it has something to
do with you being a woman.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I am no woman.
My father called me his son.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
He named me Richard.

Most of all the
citizens have fled.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Remain calm
and think this through.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
It's a long way to York, and
you're in dire need of a horse.

If Lancaster has taken the town,

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
getting out will
be no easy feat.

you are even from this town.

to turn up at a time like this?

days since we last met?

Such selfish words.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
Not that you asked, but I made
up my mind to go it alone.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
I have to go alone, and yet...!

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
What? Go where? Wait, Richard!

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
Let go! Time is of
the essence, so I can't--

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
And I want to come, too!
Let me join you at your side.

fruit and tending sheep,

from some fatal wound,

would've wrest the crown--

less of such things!

did he lose succession?

enemies frightens them.

I had no choice!

There was nothing I could do.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
You left me with no one to
embrace, and made sure you had

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
my heart with you before
you departed for heaven.

I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
Please, York.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
I didn't want--
I didn't want anyone to die!

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Damn. I drove
the horse too hard.

[RICHARD]
Hm?

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
The forest at night
is the worst.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
What a fine mess,
compliments of the Lancastrians.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
Wherever you are, I hope
you have a piping-hot meal

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
and soft place to
rest your head, Father.

Is someone there?

[RICHARD gasps]

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
Seems we got a deserter from
the Lancasters with us.

[ROBBER B]
He'll make a perfect mark.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and strip him down.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
Don't cry for mercy!

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
This is for what your
troops did to our village!

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
[ROBBER A]
Well, how's that for luck?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
This brat's a woman.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No. I'm not a woman!

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
Stop! Stop! Father!

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:46.663 position:50% align:center
[ROBBER A]
What... are you?

I am not a woman!

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
Father, save me!

[FOREST VOICES]
Demon child! Demon child!

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
You're wrong! I am neither
female nor demon!

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
I-I am my father's son!

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
Even if the darkness
swallows me whole,

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
Father will save
and purify my soul.

[gasps]

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
I'm here now.

My... light.
