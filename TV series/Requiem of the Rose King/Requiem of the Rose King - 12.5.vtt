hero of our twisted tale

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:38.056 position:50% align:center
is Richard, the Duke of York's
third and youngest son.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.016 position:50% align:center
Though he presents
himself as a male,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.728 position:50% align:center
his body harbors a secret
only few have come to know.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I wonder when...
my arms will grow strong.

[JOAN]
You couldn't do it anyway.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.028 position:50% align:center
Not with your body.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
[JOAN]
Doubt me? I can prove it.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.909 position:50% align:center

[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Richard is born intersex,

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.207 position:50% align:center
but his mother
views him as a demon

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
and shuns him from birth.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
He is also tormented
by Joan of Arc,

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:12.132 position:50% align:center
a witch who lurks deep within
the recesses of his mind.

He loves and cherishes
all three of his children.

In fact, he dotes on
Richard most of all.

[RICHARD]
Father is my light.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
Only he has the power to
save me from this life,

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.568 position:50% align:center
and the darkness and
gloom that come with it.

[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Though the House of Lancaster

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.614 position:50% align:center

be seated on England's throne

from the throes of battle,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50% align:center
but parliament refuses to
acknowledge him as king.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:54.841 position:50% align:center
He is named Lord Protector to
King Henry the Sixth instead.

[RICHARD]
Have they no shame?

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center

his pursuit of the throne,
and another war comes to pass.

[CECILY]
Silence demon!

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
The only reason he went was
because you tricked him

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
with your evil, honeyed words!

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
You aren't my son,

Then one night,

Richard has an
unexpected encounter

[HENRY]
I'm making a sundial.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE NARRATOR] The stranger,
bathed in moonlight,

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
captivates Richard for
reasons he cannot explain.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
Perhaps the shared
trauma of growing up

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
without a mother's love
is what forges their bond.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Not me. Because I'm
sure that I won't go to heaven.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
I'm a demon child.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
If my own mother can't love me,
how could I expect that of God?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
Please let me pray for you.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
All that I need to
know is your name.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
It's Richard.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
[HENRY]
And my name is Henry.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
So, Richard, could I interest
you in being my friend?

I would slaughter
everyone with a smile.

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.867 position:50% align:center
This also benefits the
royal family, of course.

00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50% align:center
So what say you, Brother?

00:22:51.204 --> 00:22:55.625 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] If I cannot convince
you, I'll lend you this blade.

00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:58.253 position:50% align:center
Bury it in my heart.

00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:00.630 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD laughs]

00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:02.007 position:50% align:center
Liar.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.175 position:50% align:center
'Tis no lie.

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:05.844 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Tell me the truth.

00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:12.058 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anne. I want you to marry me.

00:23:12.142 --> 00:23:17.397 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I fear his heart
and words are empty.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.566 position:50% align:center
I'm certain.

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.276 position:50% align:center
After all...

00:23:22.986 --> 00:23:25.321 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Richard is dead.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Died alone
in the woods that day.

00:23:35.957 --> 00:23:38.501 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Thus, our play
proceeds to its second act

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.837 position:50% align:center
amid a whirl of love and hate.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.006 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] If it will allow
me to escape my fate,

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
then a demon I shall be.

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
I'll make anyone
who harms him pay,

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:47.844 position:50% align:center
no matter who or
what they are!

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:50.597 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] 
This pain you feel. Remember it.
