[YORKIST NOBLES chatter]

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.222 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE A]
Say, have you heard?

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE B] Yes. I suppose
the rumors were true.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.309 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST NOBLE C]
"G" shall be the downfall

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
of the royal family.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] George can no longer
make rational decisions.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
Laying the blame
on him was simple.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] I can hardly believe
George was the one responsible

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
for placing a curse on me.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
Though I'm not charging
him just yet,

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
I'd rather keep him
under a close watch.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
He may come to his
senses given time.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I must ask.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
What example will it set if he
goes unpunished for treason--

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.129 position:50% align:center
You have my thanks.
I could not be more grateful

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
for all of the effort
you've put forth.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
It's a bit early,
but this banquet is over!

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
[GREY]
That's quite all right.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] Yes. Your health
comes first and foremost.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
I told you that we
should have killed him.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
Seems it's always the way.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.228 position:50% align:center
Hope drives people mad.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] I wish for a
family celebration today.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
Come Richard! We sally
forth into town tonight!

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
You'll join, yes?

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.167 position:50% align:center
These royal houses with
their flowered crests

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.920 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
[PROSTITUTE A] You are indeed
well met, Your Majesty!

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I brought my brothers
along this time as well!

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
[PROSTITUTE B] I presumed
we were a distant memory

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50% align:center
in Your Grace's mind, thanks to
your obsession with that woman.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
She is a rose, but you
ladies are lilies in bloom.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
All flowers have
their own beauty.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
My disgust is so great it's
in the realm of respect.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The same as ever.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
I'll simply wait it out.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
The way I've grown accustomed.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Tell the king I enjoyed myself.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
Pass the time
however you see fit.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
[PROSTITUTE C] My lord, please
allow me to work for my pay.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I merely do as I'm bid,

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
as long as it's for
the sake of York.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[BETH]
Insolent man!

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
Come now!

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
Stop putting on airs and
drink up, you whore!

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A gasps]

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A grunts]
Who the devil are you?

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
I'm the Duke of Gloucester.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
Richard Plantagenet is my name.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A gasps]
Begging your pardon, Your Grace!

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
[BETH giggling]
Thank you, Uncle Richard!

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
Beth, have you been
drinking tonight, or...?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
Yes, I have! Now we
can drink together!

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
I think not. This is not
a proper place for you.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
Then why don't we go
out somewhere else?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted to
experience the town at night!

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
[BETH] What do you think?
Suits me, yes?

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
[BETH giggles]

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
A princess out at night
in men's attire?

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
This world's doomed.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
It's better than letting her
fly out all on her own.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
[BEGGAR A]
Please spare me a blessing!

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
I pray God will not forsake
me the way my parents did.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
They said my sin
caused my sickness,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
and that a demon got
a hold of my flesh!

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] What difference is
there between him and me?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
Only the protective cloak
of my rank and name.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Nothing more.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
[ROBBER A]
You there, good sir!

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
I'm fairly positive you and
I have met somewhere before,

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
haven't we?

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
Mind yourself.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
Too good for me, huh?
You look like some drifter.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center
Just like we are!

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
He thinks they're the same?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.271 position:50% align:center
[PATRONS shouting, laughing]

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
[BETH]
Yay! I'm the winner!

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
Well, gentlemen.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
If memory serves, you swore
you'd obey the king if you lost!

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
And that's an oath
we intend to keep.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
Command me, Your Grace.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.910 position:50% align:center
[BETH]
Mm. Ahem!

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Then as your reigning
sovereign, I order you...

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
...to each confess your first
love to me here and now!

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
No one.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
[BETH]
What? Not even your wife?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
Aw, what a disappointment.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
I'd hoped I'd get to hear
some romantic stories.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
What of you? Surely you two
have far dreamier tales.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
Anne was mine.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
You married your
very first love!

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
In all honesty,
I suspected as much.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine a more perfect
pair than you and Anne!

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
What about you, Catesby?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
I'm curious as well.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
Was there ever a time a
straightlaced man such as you

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
let romantic fantasies
fill his head?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Ridiculous. Of course not.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
Yes... My whole life.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
I have loved one, and only one.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
Wow, what's she like?
Are you together now?

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
I was oblivious.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you had someone
like that in your life.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
This person. They're kind, yes?

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Lord Richard--

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
I am king this time.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
And I've a command
in mind, Richard.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
Select the one here
you trust the most,

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
and bestow them with a kiss.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
Lord Buckingham!

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
[BETH]
No! You mustn't do that!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
It's a royal order. Aren't you
the most loyal of all?

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Hm!

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hope drives people mad.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
I see now how right you were.
It's just as you said.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Richard, it's only a jest.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
Is it over?

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Yes. Our evening
adventure has reached its end.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
Long ago, he carried
me on his back

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
like that to the
ends of the earth.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] People don't
change, not truly.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
If you feel as
though someone has,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
you simply did not
know them well.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
Richard. Become merciless.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
After all this time, you have
hope for people still.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
If you gave up such optimism,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center
you'd be able to place
that hope in yourself.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
The same way you do?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50% align:center
Precisely.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I have no brother.
I am like no brother.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] And this word "love,"
which graybeards call divine,

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
be resident in men like one
another and not in me.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
I am myself alone.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
The blood of York will conceal
the awful sin of this body.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
Such that no one can overcome
its authority, not even God.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Buckingham.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
I want you... to kill George.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
As you wish, Your Grace.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] I know an
assassin named James Tyrrell.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
He will perform any
job to perfection

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
so long as he is paid.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
I'll meet with his go-between
and convey your orders anon.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] It's no good
simply killing him.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
With George gone, the power
of the queen will only grow.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Then what say
you to this idea?

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
Convince His Grace the
Woodvilles drove George to die.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I say tell me more.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
Wait, Richard. You are going
to visit George, aren't you?

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.551 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Hello, Mother.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
[CECILY] I knew this day
would come eventually.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
I just knew it.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Of what do you speak?

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
[CECILY growls]

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST GUARD A]
Lady Cecily!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
[CECILY]
Fie on you, Richard!

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
You may fool the rest
of them, but never me!

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
You're a demon that destroys
everything in its path!

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
O Lord! Please protect and
watch over my beloved sons!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Mother, is that you?

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Not quite, George.

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Richard?

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
Wine. Bring me wine!
It makes the pain bearable!

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Today, a sentence
of death will be pronounced.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
No! Impossible! I haven't
been called to trial yet!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
Those demons that thrive around
the king arranged it all.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
The ones to blame are
the Woodvilles, those knaves!

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] George. I cannot
leave you like this, I refuse.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Dear brother.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.277 position:50% align:center
My sole ally in this
cruel world is you.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Yes. And I will deliver you,
or else lie for you.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] That man's crimes
against His Royal Majesty

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
are unpardonable.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
They're treasonous, of course,
but also an affront to God.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
Thus, the punishment
he's most deserving of--

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Halt! Are you drawn forth

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
among a world of men
to slay the innocent?

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
Who pronounced the bitter
sentence of my death?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
Guards! Seize him this instant!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Silence, pig!
You Woodvilles are shameless!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
You could achieve
the rank of king,

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
but your soul would
be poor as ever!

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Go back to hell,
you clan of demons!

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
This, I will lend no ear.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
No, listen to me!

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
Demons are manipulating the king

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
into selling England
to the devil,

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
and I've been chosen as
their human sacrifice!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
You all serve a murderous king!
To threaten me--

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
Someone seize him!
Put an end to this!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Lay no hands on me!

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
The deed you undertake
is damnable!

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
God will no doubt thank
the one who kills him.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
Maybe somebody ought
to go and tell him.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
That he's not the
man on trial here.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Perish for the royal
family anointed by God.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
My brother...

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY grunts]
'Tis open revolt!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
He called us a clan of demons
in front of the whole court!

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
There is truly no
escaping attainder now.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] Too lenient
considering this is not his

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
first betrayal!

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
Your Grace. The one who has
suffered the greatest slight

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
to their honor is
Her Majesty the Queen.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
My honor is of little
concern to me.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
However, I cannot forgive
one who would tarnish

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
the king's name,
no matter the perpetrator.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
If he lets it stand...

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
[DORSET] He'll bring
about another rebellion!

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] Treason will
only beget further treason,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty! It's true!

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
Have the guards bring a
cask of wine to him.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
Before the execution.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] I suppose Mother will
never find it in her heart

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
to forgive me for this.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
She has always been
especially fond of George.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
When we were young,

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
she often told him stories about
the wicked witch of the forest.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Those tales frightened
him so much.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
He'd hide in my bed
because he couldn't sleep.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
He'd say children who
got lost in the woods

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
turned into witches themselves.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Then he thought I became
a witch as well?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
He's such a pure soul, that
he'll believe anything he hears.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
Both divine miracles, and
demonic whisperings alike.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Who goes there?

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
You're not the jailer.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
Is that barrel my final meal?

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
I guess in the end,

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
the honor of the York
royal family is all for show.

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
I lost my restful sleep
and only obtained suspicion

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
and sorrow in its place.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I never dreamed
this day would come to pass.

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Back then I
thought the bond of family

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
would last forever.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
But I have one hope left.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
One last ray of light
giving me strength.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
My little brother, Richard.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
He promised to deliver me.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] George is a
bungling oaf of a man,

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
but also a lovable brother.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
And while he did betray me once,

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
he eventually found his
way back to my side.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
We embraced and he swore
his fealty to me.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
I'm so tired.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
I wish not to feud
with him any longer,

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
but it seems I cannot
avoid fraternal conflict.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
At least not...
while I wear the crown.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps] Richard must've
sent you to rescue me.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
So much compassion
in one man's heart.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
Brother. What you
need now is rest.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] No. It won't do.
I'll rescind the order.

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
I'll stay George's execution!

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
Yes. Stay it and let
our brother live.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.697 position:50% align:center
Brother, yes!

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
Who else could you
be if not his man?

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
Come to deliver me!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
But why do you look so familiar?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
[blade slices]

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Huh...

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Somebody. Please, help me!

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
I bid thee good night, Brother.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE grunting]

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Inestimable stones,
unvalued jewels.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
All scatter'd in the
bottom of the sea.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Ah... This place must be hell.

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
George?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE, GEORGE gasp]

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
What do you mean my
brother's no more?

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
I countermanded his
death sentence.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
He likely took his
own life in his grief.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
Poor soul!

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
The proudest of you all have
been beholden to him for his

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
entire age, yet none of you
would once beg for his life!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Far from it, in fact.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center
You all clouded my mind
and spurred me

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
to order the death penalty!
Every last one of you did!

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
But, Your Grace.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Get out! Leave us this instant!

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]
Your Majesty!

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] 
Please, stay strong!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY]
This is absurd!

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
He intends to place
the blame on all of us?

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
I recall him wanting George
gone more than anyone!

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
[DORSET] My guess is
he's secretly relieved,

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
but he can't truly show it.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
[HASTINGS]
You dare besmirch His Majesty?

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
The survival of His Grace
is presently in question.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
No!

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
George is deceased.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
So now... what happens if
the king meets his end, too?

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Perish the thought!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.708 position:50% align:center
Anthony, you worry for naught.
If His Majesty does die,

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
there's a legitimate
prince to succeed him.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY]
Hm.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
The prince is still
a child, though.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
Meaning he'll need someone
to govern for him.

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
And I suppose you think
that someone should be you?

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Now, with the king
on his deathbed,

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
and the Duke of Clarence
passed on, the natural choice

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
for the king's regent would be
the Duke of Gloucester, no?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
Be that as it may, think of
all we've done here.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Think of how we Woodvilles have
labored for not only His Grace--

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
It's you who's not thinking!

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
Richard's been shedding
blood for the king far longer!

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
While Woodvilles once
donned Lancastrian colors

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
and took out Yorkist men!

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
Surely Her Royal Majesty agrees?

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
That was all in the past!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
You're right, the both of you.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
My husband died in battle
at Saint Albans years ago.

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
His corpse was
shamefully plundered

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
and dumped in an alley.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
He had nothing of value left,

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
save for a single,
muddied memento.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] No longer am I
the poor, widowed Lady Grey.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
I am the wife of
Edward Plantagenet.

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
Therefore, the Queen of England!

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty...

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Stop it, please. All of you.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
To squabble on this day
is a callous insult

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
to my brother's death.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
Sheath your sharp tongues,
for foes we are not.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
'Twould be a more
biting pain than death.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
Such torment is too much.
Far too much.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
[HASTINGS gasps]

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:15.679 position:50% align:center
Yes. Well said. I may have been
a touch indecent just now.

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
And I as well. Forgive me.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] To silence
those notorious nobles

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
with a single tear
is quite a feat.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
Not even the witch
could do that.

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
Now, one is gone.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
You're that much closer to
claiming your own throne.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
Which thorn is next?
The princes? The king?

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
Whoever brings harm to
the great House of York

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
is next on my list of
weeds to cut down.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
Even if that weed is
someone you love?

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Buckingham.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
I killed the person I love
most in this world already.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
So yes.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'll return to my duchy for now.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
[JANE]
Quite the commotion.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
My lord, in regard to
your precious sovereign,

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
I have a warning for you,
so listen well.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
There's a man spreading
salacious rumors 

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
about the secret his body holds.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
What secret do you imply?

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:22.620 position:50% align:center
Oh? Don't tell me
you didn't know.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Speak plain, wench.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[JANE] Perhaps you should
investigate yourself.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
A secret? Can't be...

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
Richard swore that he would
keep naught from me!

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
There's no reason to mourn.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
It will all serve to sustain
our most cherished York.

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Who's there?

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
No one is to enter
without permission.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Father.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:15.173 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
I had an awful nightmare
where you had passed away.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
There was this great war,
and you fought but...

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
But you didn't come back.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM gasps]

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
I have emerged victorious
from battles many times now.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
I promise I won't die so easily.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM sniffles]
Truly?

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
Any son of mine should
have the courage

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
to banish his bad dreams.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
Especially since you are
the Earl of Salisbury now.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50% align:center
Do you feel better?

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Mm...

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
I might if you gave me a hug.

[gasps]

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
I-I'm sorry! I promise
I'll get stronger!

[ROBBER A] Please! Heed to
what I have to say!

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPERSON A] A demon in
the palace? What rubbish.

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
[ROBBER A] This matter's
of great importance!

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPERSON B]
I haven't got time

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
for your senseless fantasies!

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[ROBBER A]
But it's true!

He's the demon child
from back then!

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Will no one listen to me?

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
My Lord. Why did
you come out here?

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
Why did you?

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
Of course. You've been a loyal
servant to our king for years.

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
So tell me...

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.633 position:50% align:center
This dark secret of
Richard's body, what is it?

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY gasps]

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
So then you are aware.

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
Why did Richard hide it
from his right-hand man?

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
Speak! What do you know?

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY, BUCKINGHAM grunting]

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
