[CECILY]
Fie on you, Richard!

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
You may fool the rest
of them, but never me!

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
You're a demon that destroys
everything in its path!

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
O Lord! Please protect and
watch over my beloved sons!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Mother, is that you?

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Not quite, George.

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Richard?

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
Wine. Bring me wine!
It makes the pain bearable!

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Today, a sentence
of death will be pronounced.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
No! Impossible! I haven't
been called to trial yet!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
Those demons that thrive around
the king arranged it all.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
The ones to blame are
the Woodvilles, those knaves!

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] George. I cannot
leave you like this, I refuse.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Dear brother.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.277 position:50% align:center
My sole ally in this
cruel world is you.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Yes. And I will deliver you,
or else lie for you.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] That man's crimes
against His Royal Majesty

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
are unpardonable.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
They're treasonous, of course,
but also an affront to God.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
Thus, the punishment
he's most deserving of--

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Halt! Are you drawn forth

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
among a world of men
to slay the innocent?

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
Who pronounced the bitter
sentence of my death?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
Guards! Seize him this instant!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Silence, pig!
You Woodvilles are shameless!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
You could achieve
the rank of king,

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
but your soul would
be poor as ever!

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Go back to hell,
you clan of demons!

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
This, I will lend no ear.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
No, listen to me!

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
Demons are manipulating the king

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
into selling England
to the devil,

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
and I've been chosen as
their human sacrifice!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
You all serve a murderous king!
To threaten me--

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
Someone seize him!
Put an end to this!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Lay no hands on me!

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
The deed you undertake
is damnable!

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
God will no doubt thank
the one who kills him.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
Maybe somebody ought
to go and tell him.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
That he's not the
man on trial here.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Perish for the royal
family anointed by God.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
My brother...

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY grunts]
'Tis open revolt!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
He called us a clan of demons
in front of the whole court!

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
There is truly no
escaping attainder now.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] Too lenient
considering this is not his

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
first betrayal!

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
Your Grace. The one who has
suffered the greatest slight

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
to their honor is
Her Majesty the Queen.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
My honor is of little
concern to me.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
However, I cannot forgive
one who would tarnish

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
the king's name,
no matter the perpetrator.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
If he lets it stand...

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
[DORSET] He'll bring
about another rebellion!

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] Treason will
only beget further treason,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty! It's true!

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
Have the guards bring a
cask of wine to him.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
Before the execution.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] I suppose Mother will
never find it in her heart

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
to forgive me for this.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
She has always been
especially fond of George.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
When we were young,

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
she often told him stories about
the wicked witch of the forest.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Those tales frightened
him so much.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
He'd hide in my bed
because he couldn't sleep.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
He'd say children who
got lost in the woods

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
turned into witches themselves.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Then he thought I became
a witch as well?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
He's such a pure soul, that
he'll believe anything he hears.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
Both divine miracles, and
demonic whisperings alike.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Who goes there?

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
You're not the jailer.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
Is that barrel my final meal?

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
I guess in the end,

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
the honor of the York
royal family is all for show.

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
I lost my restful sleep
and only obtained suspicion

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
and sorrow in its place.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I never dreamed
this day would come to pass.

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Back then I
thought the bond of family

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
would last forever.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
But I have one hope left.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
One last ray of light
giving me strength.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
My little brother, Richard.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
He promised to deliver me.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] George is a
bungling oaf of a man,

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
but also a lovable brother.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
And while he did betray me once,

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
he eventually found his
way back to my side.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
We embraced and he swore
his fealty to me.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
I'm so tired.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
I wish not to feud
with him any longer,

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
but it seems I cannot
avoid fraternal conflict.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
At least not...
while I wear the crown.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps] Richard must've
sent you to rescue me.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
So much compassion
in one man's heart.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
Brother. What you
need now is rest.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] No. It won't do.
I'll rescind the order.

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
I'll stay George's execution!

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
Yes. Stay it and let
our brother live.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.697 position:50% align:center
Brother, yes!

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
Who else could you
be if not his man?

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
Come to deliver me!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
But why do you look so familiar?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
[blade slices]

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Huh...

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]
Somebody. Please, help me!

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
I bid thee good night, Brother.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE grunting]

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] Inestimable stones,
unvalued jewels.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
All scatter'd in the
bottom of the sea.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE]
Ah... This place must be hell.

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
George?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE, GEORGE gasp]

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
What do you mean my
brother's no more?

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
I countermanded his
death sentence.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
He likely took his
own life in his grief.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
Poor soul!

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
The proudest of you all have
been beholden to him for his

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
entire age, yet none of you
would once beg for his life!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Far from it, in fact.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center
You all clouded my mind
and spurred me

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
to order the death penalty!
Every last one of you did!

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
But, Your Grace.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Get out! Leave us this instant!

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]
Your Majesty!

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY] 
Please, stay strong!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY]
This is absurd!

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
He intends to place
the blame on all of us?

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
I recall him wanting George
gone more than anyone!

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
[DORSET] My guess is
he's secretly relieved,

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
but he can't truly show it.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
[HASTINGS]
You dare besmirch His Majesty?

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
The survival of His Grace
is presently in question.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
No!

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
George is deceased.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
So now... what happens if
the king meets his end, too?

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Perish the thought!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.708 position:50% align:center
Anthony, you worry for naught.
If His Majesty does die,

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
there's a legitimate
prince to succeed him.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
[ANTHONY]
Hm.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
The prince is still
a child, though.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
Meaning he'll need someone
to govern for him.

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
And I suppose you think
that someone should be you?

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
Now, with the king
on his deathbed,

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
and the Duke of Clarence
passed on, the natural choice

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
for the king's regent would be
the Duke of Gloucester, no?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
Be that as it may, think of
all we've done here.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Think of how we Woodvilles have
labored for not only His Grace--

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
It's you who's not thinking!

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
Richard's been shedding
blood for the king far longer!

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
While Woodvilles once
donned Lancastrian colors

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
and took out Yorkist men!

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
Surely Her Royal Majesty agrees?

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
That was all in the past!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
You're right, the both of you.
