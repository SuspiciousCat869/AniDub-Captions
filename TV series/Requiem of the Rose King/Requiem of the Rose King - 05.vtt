00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
He's usually quite docile
and doesn't act this way.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Is this boar the one you saved?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
I had always thought it
ended up being served

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
as that night's main course.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
This is your chance!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
I'd very much like to
volunteer myself

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
to be your training
partner, Richard!

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
I'm an accomplished rider!
Better than most men, in fact.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
At least the ones that
are here, in the castle.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE grunts]

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
What have we here, dear Anne?

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
The hem of your pretty
dress was somehow torn?

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
Could this be the fault
of that little white boar?

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
Tearing a lady's
dress necessitates

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.065 position:50% align:center
proper recompense,
don't you agree?

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
You've forced my hand.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
Just know that I will not
be going easy on you.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
Shall we?

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Lord Richard! This way!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I have to admit.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
Your horsemanship
is quite impressive.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]
Truly? That means a lot.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
You see, ever since
I was a little girl,

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
I was always envious of boys.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
As outlandish as it sounds,

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
I would've much rather
ridden off to battle.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
More so than improving
my needlework.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
But Father scolds me,
saying I wouldn't have

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
such thoughts if I knew
the horrors of war.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
And yet, I still dare to dream.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
You know, I am certain you would
have made an excellent knight

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
if you had been born as a man.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[ANNE sighs]
Thank you, Richard.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]
Look at all of these acorns!

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
They're everywhere!

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
Why don't we take a moment
to gather them all up

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
and then bring them
home to Whitey!

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'd be delighted!

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Anne is so
different from other women.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's strange.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
Being with her puts
my mind at ease.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
Unlike him, she doesn't
trouble my thoughts or heart.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Just being with her like this,

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
I feel as though I could
forget everything else.

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
We don't have a basket.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
Should we wrap them up inside
a cloak to carry them?

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
We can simply come again.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
We'll be sure to
bring Whitey, as well.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] It's fine as long
as I don't get too close,

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
so I won't fear losing you.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
If I don't grab your hand,
I won't have to let go.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE] How could a
blessed king take a woman

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
who isn't a virgin to wife?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
What ails me even more is how
much Edward favors Richard.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
I used to be the
favored brother,

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
but that marriage
changed everything.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
Really, Lord George,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
we've not met in ages, yet all
you talk about is the king!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
Am I not in even your
most fleeting thought?

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
Isabelle, I'm so sorry.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
Since we're on the subject,
I wonder if King Edward

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
is truly suited for
a sacred throne.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Based on my personal
observations,

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
I believe you would make
a much better ruler

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.178 position:50% align:center
than the one England has now.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE yelps]
You mustn't act so impulsively.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
Could I interest you in
another cup of wine?

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps] Warwick, um.
What brings you here this--

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
Having congress before marriage
is going to be a problem,

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
My Lord Duke.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
That was not my intent,
I assure you!

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
You said it yourself, yes?

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
A king should not be wed to
a woman who's been sullied

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
before their union.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
Which is why I must ask
you to restrain yourself.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
This is the precious body of my
daughter and a future queen.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
Uh, a queen? Lady Isabelle?

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
Of which country?

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
Your country, of course.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
My king.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.357 position:50% align:center
[GEORGE gasps]

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SERVANT A sighs]
Another cold day.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
--[door rattles]
--[RICHARD] Hm?

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Shh. Don't make noise.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
My apologies! I didn't
want to bother you

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
until you were finished
with your work.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
You'll take ill while you wait.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
It's so cold that the
rivers have frozen over.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Y-Yes, they have!

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
That's why I'd like to
go ice skating with you.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I feel bad
for interrupting you.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
Should we go back?

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Believe it or not,

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning
to get more exercise.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm more concerned
about your footing

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.447 position:50% align:center
than my writing.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'll be perfectly fine!

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.285 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
I've gone skating many times.

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.788 position:50% align:center
Why don't we race to that
tree and I'll show you

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
just how capable
I am on the ice.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
A race it is.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
I won't go easy on you!

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] The time I spend
with Anne steadies me

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
in a way nothing else can.
With her, I'm free to be myself.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
I do believe victory is mi--

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
These new emotions and thoughts.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
I've never experienced
this... with anyone.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anne, your foot.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
The lace is untied. Allow me.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
O-Oh. Thank you, Lord Richard.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
[ANNE sneezes]
I ruined our good time.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
I'd blame this cold weather
before I'd blame you.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
Truly is a shame.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
I hoped we could make a snowman,
but that's not possible now.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
Is it too childish?
Building a snowman, I mean.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
Have we outgrown such things?

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
It's just, I doubt I
would be any good at it.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
I've only ever made
one when I was little.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
My valet caught me
staring at the snow,

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
so he taught me
how to play in it.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Was this valet you speak of

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
Mister Catesby, by chance?

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
It was. How'd you...?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
I remember him. Very clearly.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
He never strayed from your side,
even for the briefest moment.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Is this a fever dream,
or did Lord Richard 

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
really speak to me
of his childhood?

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Do you know
what kind of presents

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
women like these days?

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
What, may I ask,
made you think I would?

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
You're technically a woman.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
What I am is you.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
So what would you
like as a gift?

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
Since half of you is a woman,

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
your conclusion will at
least be half correct.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
I would loathe to
receive hair ribbons

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
or dresses as thoughtful gifts.
Because a woman I am not.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
Come on. Both of
us know you know.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
Or are you still not yourself?
Been like that a while now.

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:35.180 position:50% align:center
For heaven's sake,
you're reading romances!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Though what you feel is love,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
one emotion doesn't
make you a man.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
I am the man I have
always been.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Oh, look! Happy endings
are so sweet.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
I was just wishing her well.
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
Same goes for you.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
If you believe your story
to have a happy ending,

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
you haven't been paying
close enough attention.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I'm anticipating no such thing.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
It's just, Anne is special.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
She's in a class of
women all her own.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Where is George?

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
[ISABELLE]
With His Majesty.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
He's seeking
permission to marry me.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Permission? Hmph!

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
The king himself proved such
niceties aren't necessary.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] I can't dethrone the
king as things presently stand.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
Though I have George,
I still need other allies.

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Anne. You're looking better.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
Yes. I feel better.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
I suspect Richard's
visit played a small part.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
[ANNE sighs]

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
Beautifully done.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.919 position:50% align:center
Continue this
seduction of the duke.

00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
Make him obsessed with you.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
What? It's not a seduction!

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
That's a horrid word to
describe our relationship!

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Richard is still young.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
He can't fight the allure
of a woman's body.

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
The bond Richard and I share

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
isn't tainted with such
devious intentions.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
Listen, Anne.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:09.149 position:50% align:center
You and the Duke of Gloucester
will one day be wed.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] I trust you
understand the Neville house's

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
current circumstances.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
What we need now is
Richard's unwavering support.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
So life's a game of chess
and he's one of your pawns?

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK] Naturally.
It's an aristocratic marriage.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] But Lord Richard...
is so kind and pure of heart.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
No!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
Pardon?

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I don't want that!

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
I've never defied
you before, Father.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
Not once.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
But this is too far!

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
Even if it's not to your liking,
I will arrange the match.

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
You don't have to be
in love with Richard.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
In fact, love is irrelevant.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
Just continue to captivate his
heart the way you have been.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
I won't! I refuse.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
Father, I should have
a say in this matter.

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
And I say I will not be
wedding Lord Richard!

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Mm?

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I can't.

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
Not if... you're just
going to use him.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
Because I really do love him.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
[WARWICK]
Such a foolish blunder.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
And Richard is so
deeply suspicious.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able to
win him over after this.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
The course of history has gone
astray and I must make it right.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:46.663 position:50% align:center
He was the true king,
not his son!

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
It's my duty as Kingmaker

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
to put the one most fit for
the crown on the throne.

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] Richard is with
the Earl of Warwick now?

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
I can't help but
feel rather anxious.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] There's nothing
to worry about, my love.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
Sending an ally so
too sends a message.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
That says what?

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:09.436 position:50% align:center
Well, it says we still
trust him. Quite clearly.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
All I want you to focus on
is caring for the babe

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
in your womb.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH]
Hm! As you wish.

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
[ELIZABETH] I don't care
for this parasite one bit.

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
But when Edward is
finally dead and buried,

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
his spawn will be named king,

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
granting the Woodvilles
all the power of England.

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
Sweet vengeance
will then be mine.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
Come out nice
and healthy for me,

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
my little trump card.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
It's for the best, isn't it?

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later,
it would've come to this.

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:44.137 position:50% align:center
You must have known.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center
No one will love you,
but blood and the dead.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Fall into darkness.

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:59.527 position:50% align:center
Make its warmth your bed.

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
