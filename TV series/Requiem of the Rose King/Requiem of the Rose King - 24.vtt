Mother.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
Goodbye.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
And goodbye, my "curse."

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANCASTER NOBLE A]
It's your fault!

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANCASTER NOBLE B]
Irredeemable!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANCASTER NOBLE C]
We know your sins!

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
What are you doing out here?

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HENRY]
You're...

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're someone who,
I've no doubt, will accept me.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because you know
naught of anything.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're also alone.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HENRY]
Richard, forgive me.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:11.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] I'm certain these
memories are not mine.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:15.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're fragments derived
from another tale,

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
of a man named Henry,
who looked just like me.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Where is the enemy as of now?

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY] Our most
recent reports place them

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the vicinity
of Tamworth, Your Grace.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then Bosworth field will
be our field of battle.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go inform the others, Catesby.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:40.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let them know there
will be no food or rest

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
once the first sword is drawn.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center line:84%
They should enjoy their
last suppers this eve.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
He's tremendously haggard.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
God demands so much
of him, but why?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
You as well, of course.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
If there's something
you desire, name it.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center line:84%
Be it the finest
wine or rarest gift,

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.458 position:50% align:center line:84%
for not even those could
fully repay your loyalty.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.002 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your health and peace of mind,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
those are the only
things that I--

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Don't merely wish for my sake!

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
Say what you honestly want!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
What would you do if
I was suddenly gone?

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center line:84%
If all of this
were to disappear,

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
what would you live for?

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY sighs]

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SOLDIERS
chattering, laughing]

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I gained a great deal,
and lost a great deal,

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.339 position:50% align:center line:84%
until only my crown remained,
or so I believed.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
You are unfit to be king.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your father wasn't Richard
Plantagenet, Duke of York.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Did he know?

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Did Father know all along?

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD coughs]

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
What of this blood?
Was it only deemed royal

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
because of an illusion
crafted to save face?

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
If my name's a lie, then what
is the sense of this war?

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center line:84%
[door creaks]

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whitey, where are
you going this late?

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Strange.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
I sense this has
happened before.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Ah, it's warm here.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center line:84%
Warmer than the empty bed
that robs me of sleep, by far.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I should simply close my eyes.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HENRY]
Feels good, yes?

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
You enjoy sleeping
outside as well?

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]
No. It can't be.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]
How're you here?

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Ah, I see.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've come to kill me,
haven't you, James Tyrrell?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center line:84%
James Tyrrell isn't the
name I was given at birth.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, I chose
to cast it away.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have no name, past,
or friends now.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've nothing?

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose with Buckingham gone,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
you even lost the reason
to put me to death.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
So we are alike in that I
have nothing left either.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought I would be
rewarded with paradise

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
once I claimed the
light of the crown.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
However, that paradise
was home to myself alone.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center line:84%
I didn't mind it at first.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
Solitude has been kind
to me throughout my life.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yet lately,
I find it unbearable.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HENRY]
Richard, if you want to escape,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
then allow me to
act as your guide.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] I can help you
achieve the salvation

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're yearning for.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
You said so yourself.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have nothing left at all.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HENRY giggles]

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Henry. Were you
also afflicted by isolation

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
within your golden circlet?

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
Never has my desire to
see you been this strong.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
The weight of the crown,

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
the coldness of the
king's oversized bed,

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have so many things to
talk about with you now.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
But one mystery I still
have yet to solve is why

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
you were on the battlefield
that day we learned the truth.

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
Surely you had the means
to escape. You must have!

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
[grunts]

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
That rainy night you spent

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
with the Duke of Buckingham.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
For the first time, I learned
what this emptiness is.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
True emptiness.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] I was not put on
this earth merely to perish.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll sustain my existence
with one little thing.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center line:84%
A single ray of light.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] The crown?
To him, it was a prison!

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
Light isn't paradise or prison.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
You ought to know
that well, yes?

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] Light and briars
are one and the same.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] Even so,
you can't help seeking it.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] Because to seek
something is to live.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whitey, stop, come back!

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
That way only leads
farther from home!

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
Will you follow after that boar?

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
I doubt such a docile creature

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
can survive very
long in the forest.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
[sighs]

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
No need. Whitey is going home.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
For him, home is
wherever he wants to be,

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
regardless if the world
rejects him or not.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] Then what will you do?
Where do you long to be?

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I... long to be...

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
...neither beneath the
cold canopy of a bed,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
or the warm canopy
of the forest trees.

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] I gained everything
and became king with a body

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought cursed from birth.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not by blood or by name,
but by my own aspirations.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
And that is why my
fight continues.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then the battlefield
is your "home?"

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
It's where the king belongs.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have a request for you.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] Would you be my
light in this dark world?

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
What? Your light?

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] The two of us have
lost so many precious things

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
we can never reclaim.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
But perhaps We can form
a lasting friendship.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes. I'd love to be your friend.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you, Richard.
I'm so glad!

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
It's time to go.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shall return to my sleepless
bed if only to arrive

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
on a sleepless battleground
in the coming hours.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] For this is the
place I've long sought to be.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
You and I are friends.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
I won't have any regrets now...

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] ...when I
take your life, Richard.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

the "Wars of the Roses."

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DIGHTON] I blink and our
country's in yet another uproar.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
More importantly,
our livelihood's gone,

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
so finding the next James
Tyrrell takes precedence.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you, Forrest, Dighton.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
I owe you much for
the food and shelter,

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll send you news
as proper thanks.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] How many sunsets
have I seen on the day

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
before a gruesome battle?

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
At first, I went to war as
a means to exact revenge,

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
but not this time.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
All archers front and center.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
Howard, you're to take command.
Stanley and Northumberland,

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center line:84%
see to your own troops
and await my signal.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
--Aye!
--At once, Your Majesty.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where has Stanley gone to?

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center line:84%
Observing Richmond's army,

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center line:84%
or at least that's
what he claims.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let him know to array his
forces by dawn tomorrow.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHMOND] It appears
my darling stepfather

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
still can't make up his mind.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is not the time
to be so easygoing.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our enemy outnumbers us by
quite an alarming amount.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
Most of the men that
cause that alarm

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
are under my
stepfather's command.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
And as for the rest of them,
what if they turned, too?

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
What if everyone was
on our side, huh?

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD coughs]

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you alright?

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
No need to worry. It's nothing.

Lord Northumberland.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm guessing you received
this letter as well?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apparently, it was sent
to all the major leaders

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
of King Richard's army.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NORTHUMBERLAND] Henry Tudor,
the reigning Earl of Richmond

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
has formally married
Elizabeth of York,

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
the daughter of
Edward the Fourth.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST NOBLE B]
These signatures are genuine.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST NOBLE C]
Know what this means?

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
With Elizabeth as his wife,

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richmond's no longer a
mere Lancastrian usurper.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NORTHUMBERLAND] He'll be
seen as a righteous hero,

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.647 position:50% align:center line:84%
shouldering the
regrets of kings past.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY]
Hm.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you, Howard.
I appreciate the report.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HOWARD] Those curs are only
capable of underhanded tricks.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's hard for mutts
to wield swords

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your Majesty.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unsettling rumors were
already circulating

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
before we took up arms.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center line:84%
I beseech you, order a retreat.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if your throne is taken
from you now, it is not over.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rally forces, regain your
strength and fight another day.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
There won't be another.
You know that I've taken ill.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
The disease is fatal
and it's getting worse.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
Instead of spending the time I
have left in peace, I thought

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was leaving my quiet castle
for a horrific battlefield.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now that I'm here,
I'm shockingly calm,

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
despite knowing my odds.

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
That alone was the
reassurance I needed.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm certain this is
where the king should be.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is the place I've
been seeking all along.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
Do you plan to die in combat?

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I name my desire,
you'll grant it, yes?

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center line:84%
In truth, I...

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
I only ever wanted
what you wanted,

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
so you could walk a path
that was to your liking.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
Not once have I barred your way

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the sake of my own desires.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
Every action I took served
to make your trek easier.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
And though your
road is near its end,

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center line:84%
if you'll hear one
selfish request I have.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then please, King Richard.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't throw it all away!
I want you to live!

feel about this body of mine

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the day I was
born until now?

He's one raised in blood
and one in blood established!

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
One that made means to
come by what he has

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
and slaughtered those that
were the means to help him!

A base foul stone,
made precious by the foil
