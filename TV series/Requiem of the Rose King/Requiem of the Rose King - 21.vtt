[RICHARD]
That day, gasping for breath.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
I sought my father.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
So certain he was somewhere
within these walls.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Father!

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Edward. Anne. Pardon my delay.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center line:84%
Welcome to York.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've been awaiting your return,
as have the people of this city.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
Waiting for Richard
the Third to come home.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Until I die
with glory and acclaim,

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:46.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll serve as king for
the sake of his name.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:54.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
♪

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
Another rebellion?

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELY] I was astonished to
hear such a proposition pour

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
from the Duke of
Buckingham's mouth.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
He grew dissatisfied after
"our magnanimous king"

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
refused to give him his
promised compensation.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
In the end, he came to
worry his own head

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
would be the next to roll.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center line:84%
He confessed to me
he senses a crisis.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thus, he desires
my aid, and I yours.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
You, who are a man of honor,
and my comrade could also be

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
the trustworthy leader
of our uprising.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STANLEY] I find this
difficult to believe,

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center line:84%
but if Buckingham, a great
lord and the king's right hand,

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
chooses to revolt,
the very foundations of

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard the Third's reign
will be shaken to the core.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
Me, a leader of a rebellion?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHMOND]
You called, Papa?

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know I'm not your father!

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center line:84%
What, pray tell, does
this letter contain?

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
An opportunity to get ahead?

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
Should you plan and set
your snares just right,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll catch a tasty meal
regardless of who triumphs!

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center line:84%
But can Lord Buckingham
be trusted?

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
He was so devoted to the king,
they might as well be married.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center line:84%
If that's what's going through
your mind now, I have to agree.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whatever the case,

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will not fight a battle
I can't hope to win.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then how about this?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's determine if the duke's
word is gold or his tongue

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center line:84%
is plainly silver, and request
that he provide you a gift.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHMOND] Those children
in the Tower are still alive.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
You need only take a stroll
through the capital to hear the

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
whispers of people who believe
them to be the true successors.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose...

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHMOND]
You "suppose?"

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whilst you sit atop
your fence in safety,

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
you scheme to set a son
not directly related to you,

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
but a son all the same,
atop of the renewed rebel army!

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I do wish to lead,
I would much rather be a king.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center line:84%
And should a parent
not reward a child

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
for all of his efforts, hmm?

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now your allegiance can
only be bought with blood.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tell the duke if he kills
the boys in the tower,

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
you will race to his
side in an instant.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Damn you, Stanley.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I anticipated this
response, you truly are vexing.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center line:84%
But it is still promising news.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center line:84%
By joining forces
with his stepson,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center line:84%
I also gain the support of
the Lancastrian faction.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] I had once
considered how to eliminate

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center line:84%
the remnants of
King Edward's lineage

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a means to protect Richard.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center line:84%
Should they perish now,
Richard must be the culprit.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
When shall you have me kill him?

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
The time is not yet ripe.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
To fell the cunning Richard,
we'll first need a sacrifice.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
And this "sacrifice"
will be enough to save him?

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Yes, and you as well.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
All in the name of
the love you have.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] He's merely late,
I know he'll come.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
Any moment, he'll announce
himself, bow down,

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
and without shame, kiss my hand.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
Of this, I'm certain.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORK]
Richard...

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
My son, do you hear that?

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center line:84%
A sound you've longed to hear
is ringing through the streets.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
They call the name of a king.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, go forth, Richard,

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
and know I am with you
every step of the way.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT A]
King Richard!

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT B]
Praise be!

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
King Richard the Third
is finally crowned!

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Noble and valiant
people of York, I thank you.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your welcome is warm enough
to thaw a rather cold memory.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
I once beheld the horrors
of hell in this very city.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center line:84%
With the sunlight extinguished,
darkness was all that remained.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center line:84%
And at its core was my father's
death, the one I loved most.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I shed countless
tears upon his tombstone,

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
I shed far more blood
on the field of battle

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the name of York
and the rightful king!

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now. I have returned
here as that king!

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
The sun has cleared
the shadows away!

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
And its golden glow
blesses all of us!

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT C]
All hail King Richard!

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT D]
Long live the king!

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
There's light in this city.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Since the people of the
north haven't been touched

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
by the light, I want to be more
active in promoting all of them.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
Once I return to London--

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
Your Majesty!

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
A man just delivered
this message.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
That's... Buckingham's seal!

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
The envoy?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
He, um, kept his hood up,

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I didn't see his face.
He simply bid me give you this.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
It's him!

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard, you...

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I knew you'd come back.

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center line:84%
There wasn't a doubt in my mind!

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll always return to me!
Where you belong!

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
Henry!

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Impossible. You're alive.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
But how? Am I seeing things,
or are you here?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:21.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
My name isn't Henry.
It's James, James Tyrrell.

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center line:84%
A killer. Your killer.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] However, it's not
yet time for that.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] So this is
the assassin, James Tyrrell?

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
He could easily pass for Henry
the Sixth's identical twin!

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
Inconceivable.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though a bit raspier, even his
voice has similar tones.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL] I was told not to
see you, but I must learn more

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
about you before the day
of reckoning comes.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[RICHARD] Hold!
--[CATESBY] Your Grace!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
You ran off so quick.
Was it the Duke of Buckingham?

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD sighs]

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
I thought it was Henry,

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
but it wasn't... It wasn't...

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD] You can enjoy
your sweet dreams, Edward,

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
while I enjoy these sweet
treats the jester brought.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V]
Damn it!

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey! Is something wrong?

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V] Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm too angry to sleep!

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard is finally
out of London,

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
so why don't my useless
subjects rescue me?

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD] Calm down,
your royal brattiness!

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
Close your eyes and try
to imagine something

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
that makes you happy instead.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
Think of what you'll do once
you're publicly restored.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good idea.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD] If he does
somehow get the throne back,

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center line:84%
the days of him working me like
a servant will pick right up

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center line:84%
where they left off.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD] Before that
happens, I might as well just--

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll start with a feast.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD]
Huh?

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
A grand one.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll even invite Mother and
Elizabeth, and at the end...

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
...I'll have Richard executed in
front of everyone as a warning!

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center line:84%
Genius! Oh, you should
dispose of his son as well!

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V]
That was my plan,

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
but only after we show him his
father's miserable corpse.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD] Then we'll
collect his wife's tears

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
and make a cake!

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V] We'll bake
their bodies into pies

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
and watch his servants
eat every bite!

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD] Let's make
a toast with his blood, too!

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V]
Yes! As cruel as that is,

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
I bet we can go much crueler!

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD laughs]

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V]
I feel a bit better.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD gasps]

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
If they had locked me away
by myself in this tower,

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
if you weren't here, I would've
gone completely insane.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
You need to cease that kind
of chatter. It's untoward.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center line:84%
When you and I get older,
will we kill each other?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
The way Father did
to George, and...

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
...the way Richard
did to everyone.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've thought about
this for a while, now.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center line:84%
When we get out of here...

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
...I'd like for us
to be friends.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd like that, too.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD V gasps]

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
[PRINCE RICHARD]
Shall we eat these together?

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
[clanging]

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DIGHTON]
Shh, keep quiet!

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FORREST]
What does it matter?

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our client is the
master of this tower,

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I can be as loud as I want.

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center line:84%
They look like little angels.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Lord's chosen are blessed
in every single way,

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
right down to their beauty.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FORREST]
I'd say they're more like logs

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
considering how
they're sleeping.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I didn't know better, I'd
think they were already dead.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've found hard biscuits
are best for journeys,

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
even ones to the afterlife.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Henry...

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
Richard...

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, not you!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
[TYRRELL]
I was told not to see you,

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I must learn more about you.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center line:84%
What the devil does it mean?

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is this how it feels
to lose one's mind?

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORK] There is naught
to fear any longer.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
We are king,
God's anointed monarch.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] That's right.
The fight for the crown is over,

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
and there's no one
left to threaten me.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
Forgive the intrusion.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center line:84%
Tidings have just
arrived from London.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
Your Majesty?

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Buckingham is
inciting a rebellion.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Duke of Buckingham,
in revolt? Impossible.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
Richard.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
Unless you relinquish the
throne in one month's time,

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
by Saint Luke's Day
to be precise,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center line:84%
an army will march on
London to do it for you.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
The days of Richard the
Third are numbered.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
Therefore, I cannot
come to York.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have only one wish, and it
is not to see you coronated.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
On the road to my castle,
there is a wooded area.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Forest of Dean,
I believe it's called.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let us reunite there.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center line:84%
We will cross the river
and then the sea.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
Richard, please.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] Forsake your crown
and meet me in those woods

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
before the day appointed.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
Are you all right? Your Majesty!

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] You are to speak not a
word of this to anyone, Catesby.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not sure what
you mean. Which part?

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD grunts]

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center line:84%
I meant the part about
Buckingham, obviously!

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center line:84%
I apologize, Your Grace.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]
I should too, forgive me.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyway, what news do you
have from the capital?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right. Your nephews have
vanished from the Tower.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center line:84%
Make haste to London.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[CATESBY] Certainly.
--[RICHARD] No, wait!

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Something's amiss.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's a good chance rebels
absconded with the boys,

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
which could make this
Buckingham's handiwork.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
To properly quash the rebellion,

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
I must raise an army of my own
and strike the foe before they--

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
Foe? Am I going to slay him?
Of course not!

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center line:84%
You are to set out the rumor
that both children are dead.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ghosts make poor
figureheads for revolts.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
At once.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Henry. Why now? Why you?

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:03.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're gone?

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHMOND'S MOTHER]
I wish it were a mere figment

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
of a nightmare.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
But there were witnesses,

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center line:84%
and they all claimed to see the
lifeless bodies of King Edward

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Fifth and Prince Richard,
being taken from the Tower

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the dark of night, with not
even a sliver of moonlight

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the sky above.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELIZABETH gasps]
How could they? How?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not my sons!
My precious boys, dead?

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, no, that can't be right!

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're... certain?

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why? The royal tree
had left us royal fruit

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
which was to become the
seat of majesty and make,

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
no doubt, us happy by his reign!

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
My beautiful saplings!

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure that demon did it all!
Evil incarnate!

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will you take even
my last breath?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've stolen
everything else, Richard!

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why in God's holy name
have you kept me alive?

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
Make Westminster my grave!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
Such words should never part
from your lips my queen,

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
even during troubled times.

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
Think clearly.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
You said you've nothing,
but do you not still have

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
a most marvelous princess
to make life worthwhile?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, I suppose I do.

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our Heavenly Father does
send trials that are meant

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
to test us. In the end,
the side of justice

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center line:84%
always prevails and the
faithful come first.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll unite our two lights

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
and help them ascend
to a lofty height.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
Their pedestal shall
stretch up to the heavens,

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
second only to God.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your son and my
Elizabeth will marry

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center line:84%
and lead England with dignity.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then our future will be
as bright as the stars.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT B]
How odd.

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
The brothers always look out of
that window around this time.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST ATTENDANT C]
Now that you mention it,

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
I haven't seen them lately.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT E]
They vanished from the Tower.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rumor has it that they're dead.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT F]
Why is it just a rumor?

They were in the palace,

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
so there should be a formal
account of what happened.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DORSET]
Our greatest enemy is within!

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyone who defies him
won't live to tell the tale!

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
He even slew innocent children

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center line:84%
to defend a title that
should've never been his!

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
[DORSET] Tear that demon's
claws from his stolen throne!

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELY] Soldiers swarm to join us,
the stratagem was a success.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
A report's arrived
from Lord Dorset,

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
who was in hiding till now.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
The children's untimely deaths
have caused our brethren

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
to stand up in all regions.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
What of the Earl of Richmond?

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ELY] He set sail to lead
troops from Brittany.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, and his mother has obtained
Queen Elizabeth's consent

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
regarding the you-know-what.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
And Stanley?

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
Both his son and
wife are with us,

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
so naturally he shall
go along with them.

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center line:84%
After all, Lord Stanley is
serving as our intermediary!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] You realize my
father was a Lancastrian.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
So then you do this
in his memory?

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM] My blood and
title are worthless to me now.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center line:84%
I might as well not have them.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BUCKINGHAM]
There is one thing alone I want.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center line:84%
Only you, Richard. Only you.

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MAYOR A]
Your Majesty honors me!

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Now that you
head the royal guard,

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center line:84%
I pray you lend me your
strength to build a new England.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MAYOR A] Nothing would give
us northerners greater joy

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
than being of use to Your Grace.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
As the Mayor of York,
I pledge that my soul

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
shall forever be with you,
no matter the plight.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Do I go to the
forest where he waits,

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
or do I face down
rebellion as king?

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
The "appointed day"
is almost upon us.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT G]
Look lively!

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
The king and his guard
are coming through!

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YORKIST SUBJECT H] The ruler
we've been waiting for!

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Must I choose between the two?

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have to know how
I longed for this.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
Better than anyone.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE coughs]

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] Mother?
Are you coming down with a cold?

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems I may have
overexerted myself a bit.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose I learned
that from you.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center line:84%
You were burdened
on behalf of me.

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Because of my indecision.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
It's not your fault.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, since the day
you arrived, I felt lighter.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
To put it plainly, somewhere in
the confines of my heart,

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have long wondered if
choosing you was... right.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was it right for
you to become king?

00:18:57.512 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
Was it right for me to support
you in that endeavor?

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, when I saw the people
celebrating you, I forgot

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center line:84%
my doubts because I realized
this is a new beginning.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
The way that you spoke of
the future of this country,

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
you looked just like
your father once did.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
So regal, and beautiful, too.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anne...

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE]
I promise I'll get better soon.

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
I won't let this keep me from
Edward's knighting ceremony.

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
Edward, arise as a knight.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center line:84%
The just and the weak
need a guardian.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will you fulfill
that gallant role?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes! I will, my King!

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you, Father!

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center line:84%

Are you well?

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ANNE] I'm fine. I'm more
concerned with Edward.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't want his childhood to
be fraught with the sorrow

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
we experienced in our youth.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
For his sake, let's build a
beautiful kingdom together.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center line:84%

Amid betrayal, after betrayal,

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:15.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
they stood by my side.
Anne and Buckingham both.

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now I'm being forced to
choose one or the other,

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
and that's a decision
I simply cannot make.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center line:84%

Your Grace.

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD] Catesby. Remind me
what's on today's schedule.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're to go inspect
the abbey if I recall.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CATESBY]
King Richard! Command me!

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD gasps]

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
Command me.
The day is nearly here.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will you elect to go
assemble your troops?

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or will you make for the forest?

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
You honestly think I could?

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I chose to leave,

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
then what would become
of Anne and Edward?

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
The ones who believed
in me from the start?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't know. I'm simply here
to obey your wishes, Grace.

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RICHARD]
My wishes? Hm.

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
Very well, then.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center line:84%

Buckingham once more!

Yes. Other paths exist.

No one yet knows
of his rebellion.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center line:84%
