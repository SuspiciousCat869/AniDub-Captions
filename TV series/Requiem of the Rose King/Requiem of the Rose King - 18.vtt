[MALE YORKIST GUARD A]
Halt!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
These are the Duke of
Buckingham's chambers.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
Oh, Your Majesty!

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
All chambers are mine,
for I am king.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST GUARD B] Be that
as it may, His Grace isn't here.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
He stepped out for the moment.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST GUARD A] I doubt
he will return before morn.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
I want you to patrol the
grounds for a while.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST GUARDS]
At once!

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
Out till morn. Huh.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Such behavior is commonplace.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
Of course he'd rather spend the
night in someone else's company.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
A normal person's company.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
I was supposed to
have gained everything.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
So why...?

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Why does golden
slumber elude me still?

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
I yearn for heat that
burns this icy chill.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Who currently
occupies your embrace?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
No one will hold this
body in your place.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
Buckingham.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?
Is something wrong?

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.433 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I shall take my leave.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.394 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.273 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Make haste, and
return to the royal chambers.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
That's where... I was going.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.404 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
You are the king.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.656 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]
You're soaking wet.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.199 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
You weren't out wandering
in the rain, were you?

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.747 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST GUARD A]
This way! Pick up your feet!

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Mm?

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rose, and Lancaster of the red.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
These royal houses,
with their flowered crests,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.936 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Who are these men?

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] The Players from this
evening's banquet, I believe.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE A]
They made a mockery of the king

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
during their performance.
Is this an example, then?

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE B] I did
see His Majesty give an order

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
to his retainer at the time.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST NOBLE C]
If you're an enemy of a demon,

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
chances are you're also
not long for this world.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
Oh, my. Whatever shall
His Majesty do?

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
Even if he creates
a paradise rivaling Eden

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
and parades around as a
saint at the next banquet,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
it truly won't matter.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
The faces of these martyrs are
etched in the people's minds

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
which will cast a
pall over it all.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
I can't wait for the second
act of this spectacular play.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] What were the two
of them doing together?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sure troubled sleep made
him seek council from a friend.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Forgive the intrusion.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
I've orders straight
from the king.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
He bids me remain at
Your Majesty's side.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
It's best to be safe than sorry.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you know?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
Apparently Richard does think
of me, if only the tiniest bit.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
Of course he does!
Why wouldn't he?

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center
His queen's a top concern.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Then why has he yet
to fulfill his nightly duty

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
since we've been married?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
Even without love, Edward and
I were able to do what was

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
required of us, aware it
was for our future's sake.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
You know him better
than anyone, Catesby.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
If he's hiding some kind of
secret, you have to tell me!

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] When he leapt back,
his arms shielded his body,

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
as if he were
trying to cover it.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
I tried to warn you.

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
Richard will never requite any
feelings that you may bear.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
It's how things
should be, though.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:59.025 position:50% align:center
Richard's a woman, after all.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM] Mother.
Sorry to interrupt your prayers,

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
but Father told me
to stay with you.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps] Oh, I see.
Well, good, I'm glad.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I needn't worry.
Such a thing is impossible.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
[NORTHUMBERLAND] Your Majesty,
I humbly beg you pay no heed

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:19.963 position:50% align:center
to the chatter of the commoners.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
No doubt the deaths
were a result of a feud

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
over the division
of their payment.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
The only ones with motive for
murder are their fellow actors.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The man that played Lucifer

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
wasn't amongst the corpses.
Am I... overthinking?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
We know the true motive here.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
Precisely to create
our current situation.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
Some schemer saw an
opportunity to pin the blame

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
on the king and
took full advantage.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
Buckingham, I haven't seen you
with your spectacles on all day.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
I was careless.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I shall have a new pair made.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
It's fine, Your Majesty.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
Right now, I'd rather
not see clearly.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
As you wish.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] In any case,
the upcoming banquet

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
will proceed according
to schedule.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
Before it does, though,

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
I will have this urgent letter
delivered to all of my guests.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
You are to ensure
every denizen of

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
"Richard's Paradise"
receives one.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
Nobles and servants.
Soldiers and clerics.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
And of course,
our star performer.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND]
"Our beloved actor.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
Tonight, arrive as other than
yourself and enter my paradise."

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
After The Fall of Lucifer
comes Adam and Eve.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
A staple of celebratory theater!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.005 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST ATTENDANT A]
I pray you take care.

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
There may be games afoot,
Lord Richmond.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
The Earl of Richmond
has been a fugitive

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
since the Lancastrians
lost the war.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
I am but an
itinerant entertainer!

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
My Lord, restoring the
Lancasters falls to you,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
so you shoulder the
hopes of your people.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
Your frippery ways
have me thinking

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
you might do
something rather rash.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
Should I die, then that too,
is the Lord's will!

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
'Tis just so.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
Worry not, for my fate
was sealed long ago.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
So I'm certain God
will choose me

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
in the final act of
our little play.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
But what a bore this
next scene will be!

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
"Arrive as other than myself?"

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
I imagine His Majesty,
the Creator,

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
must find a fiend such
as I most inconvenient.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
And who can blame him?
Certainly not me.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
For if the devil himself
came to the king's banquet,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
it would spell the end of Adam
and Eve's beautiful utopia!

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
What a tragedy!

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SUBJECTS laughing]

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.196 position:50% align:center
Hello there. Welcome to
the demons' bliss.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're--

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
"Arrive as other than yourself".
There is no destiny here.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
Become whatever your heart
most desires you to be.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND gasps]

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
This is your paradise.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
Now dance, for you have the
freedom to move as you wish.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT A]
I've never had such fun

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
at a banquet before!

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT B] It's a
childhood dream come true,

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
is it not?

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT C] Let us
raise a toast to our host!

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT D] To His
Majesty Richard the Third!

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT E]
Yes, cheers to our new king!

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND] What is this?
Such chaos, King Richard!

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND inhales]
It's great!

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
Cheers to this
wondrous paradise!

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND] It's simply
delightful, Richard.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
Were it otherwise,
it wouldn't be worth taking.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Richard. In this garden,
are we Adam and Eve?

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
"Adam and Eve?"

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
I have a question that
I would rather ask now.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
By all means, then.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
Not here. Are you hiding
anything from me?

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
Why aren't we dressed up?
The idea was to come in costume.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
Yet you and I are
still ourselves!

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
If you have other garments
prepared in secret,

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
I would very much like to know.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
Please, just tell me!

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
We simply can't go
as king and queen!

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
Apologies, but I've
nothing prepared.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
I hoped that was the case.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to waste
the ones I'd readied.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
Lovely disguises, yes?

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Disguises?

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
They look no different
from our usual attire.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Not that one. I intended
for you to wear the gown.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] The king and queen
shall trade places.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
I feel it would suit the theme
of the banquet perfectly.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Did she notice something?

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
Perhaps last night?

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] If Edward was right
and Richard is a woman, 

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
then he wouldn't possibly
appear before the entire court

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
as his true self.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
Tell me if you're averse
to the idea, please.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
Though, what reason would
make you so hesitant

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center
towards wearing this?

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Mother!

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
Are you and Father dressing up
for the banquet as well?

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] Yes! I'll be the
king and he, the queen.

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY grunts] Your Majesty,
if you're lacking a costume

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
for the event tonight,
then take my mask.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
I'd love to see!

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anne clearly has her suspicions,

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
though if she's testing me,
she's not yet certain.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
I have no choice.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
A firm refusal would
deepen her doubts,

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
and I'd rather avoid that.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
How odd.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
Donning women's clothes
once repulsed me.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
Is that because it's a costume?
Or because I've become a demon?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
I never dreamed the
day would come when

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
I'd have you helping
me into a gown.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
It's sort of interesting
to think about.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
Were I raised as a woman,

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
I suppose this would have
been part of our routine.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
No. Considering my own sex,

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
I doubt the one stationed at the
side of a lady would be me.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Oh. Right.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Excuse me.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Were I a woman,

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
everything would have
been different, I'm sure.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
But my beloved father.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
He chose to call me his son,
so that alone became my pride.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
You look positively dashing!
It's truly wonderful, Mother!

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] I get the feeling
Richard only agreed

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
to go along with this because
of his son's enthusiasm.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
But he did agree, so I'm sure
I've been worried for nothing.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.086 position:50% align:center
It couldn't be true.
It simply couldn't be.

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anne.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Will this do, "my lord?"

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
I've never seen a single person

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
look as beautiful as you
do now in my entire life!

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center

[RICHARD]
Is it too obvious who I am?

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
I knew I should
have worn a mask.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
[ANNE] No wonder Edward
got the wrong impression.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
Even my body is growing
hot from merely being

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
in Richard's presence.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into me?
Why do I find her so beautiful?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT G]
I beg your pardon, my lady.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
[MALE YORKIST SUBJECT H] Would
you care to join us in a dance?

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center

N-No.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center

Why, sir!

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center

Have we met somewhere?

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
No, I wouldn't recognize
him even if we had.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center

That goes for everyone tonight.

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center

this beauty spare me a dance

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
Yes. Who indeed. You've got
to find them and quickly.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
Now you're a king who wants
for nothing, Richard,

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
so what fear is
holding you back?

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center

Who will I choose?

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
[FOREST VOICES]
A demon! The devil himself!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] You remind me of
someone I know quite well.

00:14:54.436 --> 00:15:00.984 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] This voice.
These hands. This warmth.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
It was him. I've been looking
for Buckingham this whole time.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
It's simple.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
I do not put my soul into words
that are spoken to grace

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
a woman's delicate ears.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.042 position:50% align:center
But words without soul
are also without truth.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
And even when the hellfire
inspiring them threatens

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
to consume me with such
demanding emotions,

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
I still can't express
how I feel.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you aren't
that person I know.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.598 position:50% align:center
For if you were,
I'd never let you go.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Wait. I'm the same.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
let you go either!

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
Stop!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
Are you... actually... Richard?

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
No, that isn't me.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
I'm not Richard,
and you are not you.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
Not tonight.

what is she normally?

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
She's a king.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] Wait a moment.
Where exactly are we going?

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Anywhere!

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
As long as no one recognizes
us as a king and a duke.

It ends with dawn's first light.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
How far do you intend to go?

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] I don't know,
but farther than this.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
I'll ride to the
ends of the earth

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
if it means escaping
everything in it!

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
There's not a soul
in these woods.

else we'll crash!

[RICHARD gasps]

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Would the king you
created be seeking death?

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
And is this how
you look upon him?

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Are those the eyes of
a man who thought all he built

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
was about to crumble away?

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps...

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.030 position:50% align:center
Why'd you make me realize?

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
I might deny it with my mind,

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
but my heart may very well
heave into my mouth.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center

I've never loved before.

Look.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
The place where we made our
pact was also covered in roses

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
and moonlight.

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] We've reached
a point of no return.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
I can't go back now
that I know the truth.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.976 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You and I are the same.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
You told me as much
a long time ago.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
Yes. That I did.

We're hoping for the
same things as well.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
So say it.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
Speak into the world
what you truly desire.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] If this devil
were to speak true,

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
he would admit he
knew what he wanted.

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:03.291 position:50% align:center
He always knew.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
From the start,
I have wanted you.

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
You... are my other half.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD sighs] We'll take ill
if we fall asleep like this.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM] If freezing
to death means freezing

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
this moment,
then I wouldn't mind.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
My clothes suit you well. Huh.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
There's a lodging my
brother once made use of

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.964 position:50% align:center
that's fairly close by.

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
Its caretaker should
be absent tonight.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.010 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
By the way.

00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
Why were you dressed
in this gown?

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center
Anne and Edward practically
begged me to wear it.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling all right?

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
I don't wear glasses for looks.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
Then I'll lead.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
Come, and don't let go.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] You mustn't
ever let go of my hand.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
When there's a warm opening,

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
the night forest will
be sure to seek it out.

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen Father
around for a while now.

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Is that a boar?

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
Uh? Maybe I'm just sleepy
and imagined it. Or...

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM giggles]

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Ah! I beg your par--

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Who is he?

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
Wait, you wouldn't
happen to be the son 

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
of King Richard, would you?

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Y-Yes.

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
You don't take after
him at all, though.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Your eyes and your hair
are nothing alike.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
Even your adorable
disposition is off.

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
It makes me wonder.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
Dear boy, are you really
the son of the king?

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
If you were the offspring
of some nameless knave

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
from only heaven knows where,

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
then that would mean the
rumor I heard might be true.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[RICHMOND grunts]

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM]
Father you're here!

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
Sorry to disappoint you,

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.512 position:50% align:center
but I'm not your father,
little cousin.

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
Hello, Elizabeth!
What brought you this way?

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
I prefer the name Beth,
so try to remember!

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
[BETH, EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM gasp]

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
[BETH, EDWARD OF MIDDLEHAM gasp]

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Elizabeth, huh?

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
The eldest child
of the late king.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
Fate's so fickle.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
I never thought I would
return to this place.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
My salvation was you,
all this time.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps] I spent
many rainy nights with him,

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
right here.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Where are the clothes?

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
I'll go fetch them while
you warm yourself.

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Sit by the fire.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Don't need much
looking after, do you?

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
I'm not some child,
so why would I?

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
Is that how you perceive me?

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Why am I
comparing them? Stop it!

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Is something wrong?

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
You've been acting odd
since we came to this house.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
Are you well?

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine, Buckingham.

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
Honest.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Yes. He's different.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
Richard, please.

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
Stop referring to me
by the title I bear.

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
Simply call me by my name
from this point onward.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
My real name.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
What is your... name?

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
Henry. My full name's
Henry Stafford.

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.345 position:50% align:center
So please use it.

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
The similarities are too much.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Thought I'd never
know peace like that again.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
When my heart poured out
as much as the rain.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
Are you here?
Have I finally found you?

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center line:10%
