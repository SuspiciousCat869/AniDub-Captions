00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
My mind's a blur.

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:18.768 position:50% align:center
I can't recall what
happened after the battle.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY]
Lord Richard.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
[CATESBY] I knocked but
I received no answer,

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
so I grew anxious.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Go fetch me some wine.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
Enough to drown in.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
You've had plenty.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
Besides, you need to eat.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.668 position:50% align:center
That's an order!

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
My lord.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
Why'd you hold your tongue?

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
About who Henry is!

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
Surely you knew.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Catesby.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
The mouth that smiled
oh so sweetly at me,

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
and the strong arms that
once held me so tight,

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
belong to the one who
snuffed out my light.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
And yet. And yet, I...

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] York of the white
rosem and Lancaster of the red.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
These royal houses with
their flowered crests

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center
have battled long and
hard for the throne.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
Nowadays, the people
refer to their strife as

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.421 position:50% align:center
the "Wars of the Roses."

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
Tell me, how are
Anthony's injuries?

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Not too serious, Your Grace.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
But I doubt he'll be able to
take part in the next battle.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
And what of our
heroic Lord Richard?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
He made no appearance
at the victory banquet.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
Although, to triumph again,

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
I'll need him on the
battlefield no matter what.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
Well then, I shall go and
look in on him for you.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
Now, if you will excuse me sir.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Wait.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Hm?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
I have but one more command.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
Find out the one who killed
Warwick during the fight.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
Whosoever defies his king
must be severely punished.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
Without fail.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
I understand, Your Grace.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Why? Why did I meet him?

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't happened
upon him, that cursed day...

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Hey!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
What are you doing?

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
I've sinned.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
I committed the
crime of treason.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
I see. So you wish
to punish yourself.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Kill me.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:19.217 position:50% align:center
Very well.
You'll die here and now.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
But, once you do, I hope you
realize that York will lose.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Listen, Richard.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
I have no interest in
your inner turmoil.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
But you're the cornerstone
of our whole army.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
If you truly don't wish to live
anymore, consider yourself dead.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
Welcome to hell, Richard.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
So...

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
[YORK]
You may remain mad.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
As long as you slay the
enemies before you.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
Think of nothing else, Richard.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
Just go on killing.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
Live to kill.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
That... is my... my punishment.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Father.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
I thought I understood that
dying in battle is an honor.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
But I also wanted to believe
that the people of York

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
would spare my
father in the end.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET]
It's no honor to die in battle.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
Death is the end of it all.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
George betrayed us, and Warwick
was slain as a result.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
York has nothing
akin to mercy, dear.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
I will be blunt.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
With Warwick's death,

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.003 position:50% align:center
the assurance of
our victory is lost.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET]
That said, I refuse to retreat.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
Because the ultimate aim of the
Yorkists is not to drive us off.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
It's the annihilation
of Lancaster.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
Why tell me this now,
Your Grace?

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] I married into
this country from France

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
when I was 15.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
The court was a writhing
nest of fiends

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
determined to ensnare me,

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
the same way they manipulated
my unstable husband.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
I haven't loved Henry
a day in my life.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
God saw fit to take
the man I truly loved.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
At least, I still have
Edward by my side.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
You're a kind girl, so I
imagine you've started

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
to develop romantic
feelings for my son.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
Listen to me, Anne.
Don't let York kill him.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
If he lives, then so
too does our house.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
If he lives, Lancaster can
still arise from the ashes.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
But, once the fighting starts,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
I'll be powerless
to help anybody.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] Do not permit him
to set foot in the fray.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
[ANNE gasps]

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] It won't do for those
words to come from my mouth.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
Is that clear, Anne?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
Though, this is not an order.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
It's merely me entrusting
Edward's life to you.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] Great lords!
Lend me your ears!

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
Your sovereign, Henry,
is once again a prisoner.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
His authority has been usurped,

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
and his realm transformed
into a slaughterhouse!

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
Oh, my tears gainsay,
for every word I speak.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
I admit the Earl of
Warwick was, indeed,

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
the anchor of our warship.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
But we aren't yet sunk.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
Though the mast
may be blown over

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
and the holding anchor gone,

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
I am still here with you!

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.334 position:50% align:center
The prince of the blood royal
is still here with you!

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
In God's name, be valiant and
give signal to the fight!

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
Brave men who so
love the red rose,

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
march forth and
claim our victory!

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN SOLDIERS cheer]

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center
My lords. Preparations for
war have been made, yes?

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
I have long awaited this moment.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Ready the horses!

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
Unfurl the flags of blood!

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
It's either victory,
or a glorious tomb!

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
I want to rush out
this very moment

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
and strike down
Yorkist soldiers,

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
clad in armor from head to toe!

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
Edward. You should run away.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
Run? What are you saying?

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
It's decided.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
I picked out a double to
stand in place of you.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
Are you mad? Or do you jest?

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
I'm guarding the
Lancaster bloodline!

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
I guess I was wrong.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
Because I thought you,
of all people,

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
would truly understand
the way I feel.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
If you lose the fight,

00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
the Yorkists will not
hesitate to kill you.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
Exactly like they killed Father.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
Isabelle has left me.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
Mother is gone.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
You're my only family.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
You're all I have.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
If we succeed in this battle.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
Rather, when we succeed,
historians will remember

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
that battle because it
birthed a great king.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
Of that, I am certain.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
Anne, you...
You're my first friend.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
So please... trust me.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD sighs] Sleep will
not come easy tonight.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
Shall we play chess?

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
It'll be good practice
for tomorrow's battle.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I'm sorry, Edward. Forgive me.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
[SOMERSET] Please take
a look, Your Majesty.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
This position places
the enemy downhill.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
What's more, they'll be
forced to array themselves

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
amid bothersome
brush and briars.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
Well done, Somerset.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
Now, I shall leave everything
to your leadership.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
[SOMERSET]
But, what of the crown prince?

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
He's still much
too inexperienced.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.735 position:50% align:center
But he knows his role.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
I told him to obey
and learn from you.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Edward?

Those Lancaster dogs!

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
Sniffed out the best place
to arrange their men.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
You forget, Brother.
York morale is high.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
And according to reports,
we've more cannons.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
But they still have
superior numbers, Hastings!

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Your Grace.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
I've an idea, so calm yourself.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] Courageous soldiers who
bear the mark of the white rose.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
Now, ready yourselves,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
for the time has finally arrived
for us to end this long war!

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Remember the wounds
we've suffered.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Remember the comrades
that were slain.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
Remember my father's
wrongful death!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
And remember York has the
lawful claim unto the crown!

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
For I shall prove my legitimacy
with my sword on this day!

[YORKIST SOLDIERS]
York! York! York! York!

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
You're sure, Buckingham?

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
The defense in the
forest is ready to go?

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Mm-hm. It's just as you ordered.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
Good. Let's start.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Keep firing
the cannons so the dogs

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
don't get a moment to rest!

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] The unexpectedly
fierce rain of cannon fire

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50% align:center
will soon push them to a panic.

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A]
Lord Richard!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Look there!
The enemy's right flank!

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
They're moving!

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
We shall make our
way to the left!

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Circle 'round them!

I must ask you remain in bed,

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
Your Highness.
You need your rest.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

My armor as well!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
Until the battle is over, you
must please stay in this room.

[PRINCE EDWARD]
I just pray I make it in time!

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
Wait for me, York!

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Don't give a single step!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Let anger govern my heart!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
And may my blade remain sharp!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Huh?

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
An ally?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No. It's not.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Wait, you're...

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Richard!

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
Do you know my name?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but unfortunately I don't
have time to talk right now.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
So please make way!

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not cut you down!

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
Then you've allied
with Lancaster, yes?

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to
let you escape me!

Halt! Why won't you fight me?

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
--Because...!
--Are you afraid to die?

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center
No!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Richard.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
The reason I can't
fight you...

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
...is because I love you.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
Richard, I...

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
Stay right where you are

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Don't go!

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center

[YORKIST SOLDIER C]
We've routed the enemy!

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
Now crush them to dust!

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

[YORKIST SOLDIER D] The
Lancastrian Prince is fleeing!

Go! Save yourself,
Your Majest--!

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
It would seem you've run
out of allies, Margaret.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
You honestly think
that I fear you?

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
The head of a rebellious mob.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
Now then. Lead on,
you tactless executioner.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
Take those filthy hands of yours

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
and murder a queen
anointed by God Himself.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER C]
We've captured Margaret!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
That means victory is ours!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER D] Nay,
the prince is still at large.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
That's right.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
Anne said she had
a decoy ready, but...

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't!

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I'm fine. I can make it.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
No one's a better
rider than I am.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
So get as far away
from here as you can,

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
Edward, and I'll do the same!

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER D]
Margaret must have given herself

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
up to let the prince escape.

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
We'll join in his pursuit!

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Anne, don't tell
me you took my place!

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
I'm guarding the
Lancaster bloodline!

[PRINCE EDWARD]
Is Mother behind this?

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
She denied me a sword,

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
then let my wife sacrifice
herself for my sake.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center

Who's there?

...will you deceive me?

It would appear you
haven't turned a hair.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
I'll endure and submit to my
fate without a struggle.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Will you?
Regardless of that fate?

No, what are you doing here?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Mother. I'm grown.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
I am no longer a small
child that holds your hand.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET grunts]
Such foolishness!

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
I beseech you, sons of York!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
Although he claims
that he is grown,

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
the prince is still a child
not worthy of your hatred!

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
If it's vengeance that you seek,
then have it on me.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
It was I who hacked off your
father's head while he was

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
a blubbering mess
of a man, after all!

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
Your father looked
absolutely wretched,

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
howling like an
animal as he died.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lancaster!

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. Sweet memories.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
The final moments of
that conceited worm

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.657 position:50% align:center
were a vision unlike any other!

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
His sorry face was
stained with his tears.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lancaster!

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
And then I sliced his head
clean off with my own hands!

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Each time I recall it,

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
my heart rejoices and I
nearly sing out in glee!

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
He lived a fool and
died a foolish death!

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
Silence, wench!

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
I will stop your heart
from singing right now!

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
Don't be rash, George.

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
Granting death to one who
seeks it would be charity.

[gasps]

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center

Stay thy hand, York, please!

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center

for your father!

Are you hurt, my prince?

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
King.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Look, Mother!
I will make for a splendid king!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
When the crown falls to me,

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
I know all eyes will, too.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Say something
befitting a subject.

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
What are you saying, Edward?

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
Kneel before me, you fools!

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
Lascivious Edward!
Perjured George!

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Reprobates from hell with the
blood of filthy miscreants!

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
Bow down! For I
am your true king!

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Once I'm king,
all my wishes will come true.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
[coughs]
Filthy traitors.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
How could you kill
an innocent child?!

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
If you spineless cowards were
as brave as you pretend to be,

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
you'd kill me, too!

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
What of Richard? Where is he?

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
That devil's butcher would never
spurn a petitioner for blood!

00:19:58.448 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
Richard's in hell.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
And he shall stay there until
he eradicates every member

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
of the House of Lancaster.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
I can't breathe.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
Is this the end?

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
None of my wishes
have come true yet.

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
I cared not for the crown.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
There was... only one
thing I truly wanted.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
A desire I wanted made real,
no matter what it took.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Richard! You came for me!

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Just one final wish.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Listen, Richard.

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I love you!

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
At least let it be you.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
I wish to perish at your hand.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
Put a sword through me, too.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
Do it now!

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
Aye, what a grand idea!

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD]
Hold!

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
I believe we have shed enough
Lancastrian blood for one day.

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
Just one drop more!

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
This woman is the
root of everything!

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely why
death's too good for her.

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
Margaret. Now's the time
for you to despair and live.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET sobs]
Edward.

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Why were you slain,
my heart, my darling boy?

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET wails]

00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET] Kill me quickly,
now you've robbed me of joy!

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
