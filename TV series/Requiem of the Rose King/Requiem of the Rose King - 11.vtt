00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
Sniffed out the best place
to arrange their men.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
You forget, Brother.
York morale is high.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
And according to reports,
we've more cannons.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
But they still have
superior numbers, Hastings!

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Your Grace.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
I've an idea, so calm yourself.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[EDWARD] Courageous soldiers who
bear the mark of the white rose.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
Now, ready yourselves,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
for the time has finally arrived
for us to end this long war!

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Remember the wounds
we've suffered.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Remember the comrades
that were slain.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
Remember my father's
wrongful death!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
And remember York has the
lawful claim unto the crown!

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
For I shall prove my legitimacy
with my sword on this day!

[YORKIST SOLDIERS]
York! York! York! York!

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
You're sure, Buckingham?

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
The defense in the
forest is ready to go?

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
[BUCKINGHAM]
Mm-hm. It's just as you ordered.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
Good. Let's start.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Keep firing
the cannons so the dogs

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
don't get a moment to rest!

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] The unexpectedly
fierce rain of cannon fire

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50% align:center
will soon push them to a panic.

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER A]
Lord Richard!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Look there!
The enemy's right flank!

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.001 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
They're moving!

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
We shall make our
way to the left!

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Circle 'round them!

I must ask you remain in bed,

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
Your Highness.
You need your rest.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

[PRINCE EDWARD gasps]

My armor as well!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
[LANCASTRIAN ATTENDANT A]
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
Until the battle is over, you
must please stay in this room.

[PRINCE EDWARD]
I just pray I make it in time!

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
Wait for me, York!

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Don't give a single step!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Let anger govern my heart!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
And may my blade remain sharp!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Huh?

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
An ally?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No. It's not.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Wait, you're...

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Richard!

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
Do you know my name?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but unfortunately I don't
have time to talk right now.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
So please make way!

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not cut you down!

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
Then you've allied
with Lancaster, yes?

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to
let you escape me!

Halt! Why won't you fight me?

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
--Because...!
--Are you afraid to die?

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center
No!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
Richard.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
The reason I can't
fight you...

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
...is because I love you.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD gasps]

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
Richard, I...

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
Stay right where you are

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Don't go!

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center

[YORKIST SOLDIER C]
We've routed the enemy!

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
Now crush them to dust!

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

[YORKIST SOLDIER D] The
Lancastrian Prince is fleeing!

Go! Save yourself,
Your Majest--!

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.548 position:50% align:center
It would seem you've run
out of allies, Margaret.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
You honestly think
that I fear you?

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
The head of a rebellious mob.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
Now then. Lead on,
you tactless executioner.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
Take those filthy hands of yours

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
and murder a queen
anointed by God Himself.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER C]
We've captured Margaret!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
That means victory is ours!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER D] Nay,
the prince is still at large.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD]
That's right.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
Anne said she had
a decoy ready, but...

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't!

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
[ANNE]
I'm fine. I can make it.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
No one's a better
rider than I am.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
So get as far away
from here as you can,

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
Edward, and I'll do the same!

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
[YORKIST SOLDIER D]
Margaret must have given herself

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
up to let the prince escape.

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
We'll join in his pursuit!

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Anne, don't tell
me you took my place!

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
I'm guarding the
Lancaster bloodline!

[PRINCE EDWARD]
Is Mother behind this?

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
She denied me a sword,

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
then let my wife sacrifice
herself for my sake.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center

Who's there?

...will you deceive me?

It would appear you
haven't turned a hair.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
I'll endure and submit to my
fate without a struggle.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Will you?
Regardless of that fate?

No, what are you doing here?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Mother. I'm grown.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
I am no longer a small
child that holds your hand.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
[MARGARET grunts]
Such foolishness!

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
I beseech you, sons of York!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
Although he claims
that he is grown,

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
the prince is still a child
not worthy of your hatred!

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
If it's vengeance that you seek,
then have it on me.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
It was I who hacked off your
father's head while he was

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
a blubbering mess
of a man, after all!

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
Your father looked
absolutely wretched,

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
howling like an
animal as he died.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.233 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lancaster!

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. Sweet memories.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
The final moments of
that conceited worm

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.657 position:50% align:center
were a vision unlike any other!

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
His sorry face was
stained with his tears.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
Lancaster!

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
And then I sliced his head
clean off with my own hands!

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Each time I recall it,

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
my heart rejoices and I
nearly sing out in glee!

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
He lived a fool and
died a foolish death!

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
Silence, wench!

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
I will stop your heart
from singing right now!

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
Don't be rash, George.

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
Granting death to one who
seeks it would be charity.

[gasps]

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center

Stay thy hand, York, please!

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center

for your father!

[PRINCE EDWARD]
King.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Look, Mother!
I will make for a splendid king!

When the crown falls to me,

I know all eyes will, too.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE EDWARD] Say something
befitting a subject.

What are you saying, Edward?

Kneel before me, you fools!

Lascivious Edward!
Perjured George!

Bow down! For I
am your true king!

all my wishes will come true.

Filthy traitors.

How could you kill
an innocent child?!

If you spineless cowards were
as brave as you pretend to be,

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
you'd kill me, too!

There was... only one
thing I truly wanted.
