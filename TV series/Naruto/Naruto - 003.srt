Ugh.

00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:08,769
Huh?

[chuckles]

00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:24,055
Today's the day,

NARUTO: "Sasuke and
Sakura: Friends or Foes?"

-Uh?

[chuckles]

12
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:11,182
-You're mine, Naruto!

13
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:14,053
Woah, agh!

14
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:17,390
-Uh, what do you think
you're doing Konohamaru?

15
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,025
-That was a slick move.

16
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,095
That's why I respect
you as a rival.

17
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,203
-But I didn't do anything.

18
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:28,304
-All right.

19
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,274
Now fight me fair and square.

20
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:33,511
-Sorry, I've got an orientation.

21
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,180
-Orientation?

22
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:36,147
-That's right.

23
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,483
As of today, I'm a ninja.

24
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,451
Believe it.

25
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,321

SAKURA'S MOM: Sakura, isn't
it time for you to get going?

30
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:02,214
-I know.

31
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,350
I'm on my way out now.

00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:07,421
<i>Chaw,</i> how long are you
going to treat me like a kid?

33
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,989
I'm a ninja now.

34
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:16,566
So I'm not a little
academy student anymore.

35
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:20,237
I'm Sakura Haruno,
kunoichi in training.

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,239
INO: See you later!

37
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,718
Good morning, Sakura.

38
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:32,786
-Good morning, Ino.

39
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,366
-So they actually
let you graduate?

40
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,434
What a surprise.

41
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,204
-Those classes are
ancient history.

42
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:49,841
We're both ninja now,
and we're both equal.

43
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,678
I won't lose to you anymore.

-Huh?

46
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:16,209
What are you doing here, Naruto?

47
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,243
This isn't for dropouts.

48
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,446
You can't be here
unless you graduate.

49
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,515
-Oh yeah, do you see this?

50
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:21,482
Do you see this?

51
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,483
Open your eyes, Shikamaru.

52
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:24,085
It's a regulation headband.

53
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,687
We're going to be
training together.

54
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,857
How do you like that?

55
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,691
-Hm.

56
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,160
-Let me put it to you this way.

57
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,630
I look great in this headgear,
like it was made for me.

58
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,633
Believe it. [chuckles]

59
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,636
-(VOICEOVER) Naruto,
you graduated after all.

60
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:38,804
I'm glad.

61
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,250
BOTH: I'm first!

62
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,357
-I won again, Sakura.

63
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,724
-Give it up.

64
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:56,293
I had to look back to see you.

65
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:58,696
My toe was at least a
tenth of an inch ahead.

66
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:01,600
-Have you always
been this delusional?

67
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:02,468
-(VOICEOVER) Sakura.

68
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,679
She's smiling at me.

69
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:13,415
I think she likes
me in this headband.

-[chuckles]

71
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,451
-Hey, woah.

72
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:16,820
Where are you going?

73
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:17,520
-Hi, Sakura.

74
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:18,221
What's up?

75
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,825
-Move it!

76
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:21,993
-Good morning, Sasuke.

77
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,235
Mind if I sit next to you?

78
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,537
-Back off, Forehead.

79
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,272
I'm sitting next to Sasuke.

80
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:33,841
-I was here first.

81
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,711
-I walked into the
classroom before you did.

82
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:37,179
Everybody saw it.

83
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,314
-Dream on.

84
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,149
-Actually, I got here
before either of you.

85
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,119
-So did I. I'm sitting
next to Sasuke.

00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,722

MAN: Most promising new
student Sasuke Uchiha.

00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:52,565
Is that him?

90
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:55,068
-Yes, he's the one.

91
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,906
-He's the only survivor
left from the Uchiha Clan.

92
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,043
-That's right.

93
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:02,277
-Hm.

94
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:14,626
Naruto Uzumaki, hm?

Hey, stop glaring at Sasuke!

-(VOICEOVER) Sakura?

102
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:34,986
Why are they so obsessed
with him? "Sasuke, Sasuke."

103
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,189
What's the big
deal with this guy?

Heh, this is great!

107
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,271
Sorry, did I bump you?

108
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:50,239
-What the--

109
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:51,073

I was supposed to be
Sasuke's first kiss.

113

Naruto will pay for
this. <i>Chaw!</i>

-Ahhh.

115
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:11,033
-I will get you, Naruto.

-Huh, they are vicious.

117
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,606
-Ah-- hm, danger.

118
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,007
Huh?

119
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,346
-Naruto, you are so dead.

120
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,347
-Hey, whoa.

121
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,083
It was an accident.

122
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:26,953
-You're finished!

123
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,056
-Hold on.

124
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:32,493
-As usual, Naruto is
right in the middle

125
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,796
of some kind of trouble.

126
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:36,431
-As of today, you
are all ninjas.

127
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:39,635
To get here, you faced
difficult trials and hardships.

128
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,937
But that's nothing.

129
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,873
What comes next will
be far more difficult.

130
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:45,443
Now you're only genin--
first level ninjas.

131
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:48,146
All the genin will be grouped
into three-man squads.

132
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,786
Each squad will be led by
a jounin-- an elite ninja.

133
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:53,687
-Huh?

134
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,288
-Oh?

135
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:55,289
-Oh?

136
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:56,624
BOTH: (VOICEOVER)
A three-man squad?

137
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,360
-Well, someone's got to
be in Sasuke's group.

138
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:00,862
I wonder who.

139
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:02,064
-I don't know.

140
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,570
<i>Chaw! </i> I'm going
to be with Sasuke.

141
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:09,073
So stay away from him, you hag.

142
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:12,812
-Ah, groups of three.

143
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,947
That'll only slow me down.

144
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,951
-I Want to be with
Sakura and-- well,

145
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:21,723
I don't care, as long
as it's not Sasuke.

146
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,192
-We want each squad to
have a balance of strengths

147
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:27,630
and abilities, so that's
how we set them up.

148
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,065
I will now announce the squads.

149
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,375
Squad seven: Naruto Uzumaki--

150
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,042
-Uh.

151
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,544
- --Sakura Haruno--

152
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,513
-Uh.

153
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,882
-Yeah!

154
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,951
-I'm doomed.

155
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,925
- --and Sasuke Uchiha.

156
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,090
-Ah!

157
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:49,291
-I'm doomed.

158
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,101
-I won't be with Naruto, then.

159
00:09:57,134 --> 00:10:00,739
TEACHER: Next, squad
eight: Hinata Hyuga--

160
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,040
-Yes, sir.

161
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:03,376
TEACHER: --Kiba Inuzuka--

162
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,343
- Heh heh heh.

163
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:06,981
TEACHER: --Shino Aburame.

164
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,916
-Heh heh.

165
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,489
-Agh, how did you
get in his group?

166
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,223
-Ka-ching!

167
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,326
True love conquers all.

168
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,095
-Ugh!

169
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,229
-I don't get it.

170
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,065
What do you see in
a guy like that?

171
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,300
He's not so special.

172
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,536
-You are so beyond
clueless, Shikamaru.

173
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:26,171
Don't you get it?

174
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,910
-No, I don't get it,
because I'm not a girl.

175
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:33,114
-Ugh, you're so
full of yourself.

176
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:34,749
Jealousy's a terrible thing.

177
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:37,152
I'd hate to be on your squad.

178
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:42,526
-Now, squad ten: Ino
Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara--

179
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,894
-Uh!

180
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,064
-Heh, did you say something
about hating to be on my squad?

181
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,599
-Ugh.

182
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,102
- --and Choji Akimichi.

183
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:52,639
-[crunching]

184
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:53,606
-(VOICEOVER) Ah!

185
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,676
Not food boy, too!

186
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:58,780
-[crunching]

187
00:10:58,813 --> 00:10:59,914
-Those are all the squads.

188
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:01,483
-Iruka Sensei.

189
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:03,686
Why does a great ninja like me
have to be in the same group

190
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,689
with a slug like Sasuke?

191
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:07,258
-Hm.

192
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,828
Sasuke had the best scores of
all the graduating students.

193
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:13,766
Naruto, you had
the worst scores.

194
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,770
To create a balanced group,
we put the best student

195
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:18,172
with the worst student.

196
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:19,574
NARUTO: Ugh.

197
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:22,577
-Just make sure you don't
get in my way, loser.

198
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,745
-Ugh.

199
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,014
Hey, what did you say?

200
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,282
SASUKE: Hard of hearing?

201
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:28,017
SAKURA: Knock it off, Naruto.

202
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,986
Sit down.

203
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,387
TEACHER: Ahem.

204
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,391
After lunch, you'll meet
your new jounin teachers.

205
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:36,161
Until then, class dismissed.

206
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,631
-Sasuke, where are you?

207
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,468
Why did he go
running off so fast?

208
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,370
Since we're in the
same group and all,

209
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,306
I thought we could have
lunch together and get

210
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,774
to know each other.

211
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:48,243
-Hey, Sakura.

212
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:49,645
Since we're in the
same group, I was

213
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:51,748
thinking we could have
lunch together and get

214
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,882
to know each other.

215
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,451
-Why would I eat lunch with you?

216
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:56,554
How could that thought
even cross your mind?

217
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:57,923
-But we're in the same group.

218
00:11:57,956 --> 00:11:59,458
So, you know, I just thought--

219
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:01,327
-Naruto, you're annoying.

220
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,934
-Sasuke, where are you.

221
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:07,868
-But, uh-- uh.

222
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:16,680
-Ugh, what a pain.

223
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:18,449
I get into the same
group as Sakura,

224
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:20,417
and he's got to be in it too.

225
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:23,922
There's got to be a
way to deal with this.

226
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:24,523
Huh?

227
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,521
Got it.

228
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,016
-All right.

229
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,050
If we're in the
same group, you're

230
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:47,152
going to have to follow my lead.

231
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:49,254
That's the only way it'll work.

232
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:50,390
-Yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:51,958
(VOICEOVER) That's
the only it'll

234
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,828
work because she throws a fit
if she doesn't get her way.

235
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,565
-Why don't you lead us
to some barbecue, Ino?

236
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,567
-Hopeless!

237
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,461
-Huh?

238
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,910
Naruto.

239
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:06,510
-Huh?

240
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:12,284
Uh!

241
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,185
SASUKE: Naruto!

242
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,154
NARUTO: Pipe down.

243
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:16,656
-Naruto!

244
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,826
If you so much as scratch
him, you're on my enemy list

245
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:19,994
forever.

246
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:22,964
[fighting]

247
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,404
-Hm, wha-- what happened?

248
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:34,011
-Heh, nice try.

249
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:40,887
Heh.

250
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,124
-He beat Naruto without
even breaking a sweat.

251
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,260
-What'd you expect?

252
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:47,363
Naruto against my boy Sasuke?

253
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,130
No contest.

254
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:55,806
-(VOICEOVER) Well, it's not like
there's a big rush or anything.

255
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,778
I'll be in the same group
as Sasuke for a long time.

256
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:00,545
But still.

257
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,753
How could I even
think he'd like me?

258
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:10,425
Let's face it, I'm scrawny and
small-- except for my forehead.

259
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,998
Why was I born with such
a big, wide forehead?

260
00:14:15,031 --> 00:14:15,599
Oh?

261
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:22,073
Oh, Sasuke.

262
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:25,144
He's looking right at me.

263
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:28,515
That look in his eyes.

264
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,787
-Sakura, your forehead
is so wide and charming.

265
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:36,325
It makes me feel
like kissing it.

266
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:41,398
-Well, there's lots
of room up there.

267
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,600
[sighs] (VOICEOVER)
Grow up, Sakura.

268
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,202
That's just a fairy tale.

269
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:47,539
And fairy tales don't come true.

270
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:51,711
SASUKE: Sakura, your forehead
is so wide and charming.

271
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,780
-Huh?

272
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:55,983
-It makes me feel
like kissing it.

273
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,028
-Ka-ching, she scores!

274
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:07,398
This fairy tale is for real.

275
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,833
-Just kidding.

276
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,703
That's the kind of dumb
thing that Naruto would say.

277
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:12,738
-Oh.

278
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:15,175
-I want to ask you something.

279
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,311
-Huh?

280
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:21,883
-Naruto, what do
you think of him?

281
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,353
-He knows about my
feelings, and he purposely

282
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,989
tries to get in the way.

283
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:29,693
He enjoys interfering
and making me feel bad.

284
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:35,401
Naruto, he doesn't understand
one single thing about me.

285
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,737
He's just annoying.

286
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,942
All I really want is for
you to accept me, Sasuke.

287
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,577
That's all.

288
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,416
-You just want me to accept you?

289
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,085
-Yes, that's how I feel.

290
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,455
I'd do anything for that.

291
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,892
[heartbeat]

292
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,236
-I let my guard down.

293
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,754
-I got you.

294
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:18,722
Ah!

295
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:19,924
-Uh.

296
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,894
In class, he couldn't even
do a simple replication.

297
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,797
How could he combine
a replacement

298
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,533
jutsu with a full
shadow clone jutsu?

299
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,337
[heartbeat]

300
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,639
-It's true.

301
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,976
I'm desparate.

302
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,114
-(VOICEOVER) finally know why--
why I like Sakura so much.

303
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:41,886
I finally understand.

304
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,921
[passes gas]

305
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:45,090
Uhhh.

306
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:46,024
My stomach!

307
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,794
What timing!

308
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:49,495
Gah!

309
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,132
-Hey, what's the matter?

310
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:53,901
-I'll be right back.

311
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:57,872
-I didn't know that
Sasuke was so shy.

312
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:01,444
Maybe he needs a little
time to get ready.

313
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:04,414
-Ah!

314
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:06,783
Uh.

315
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,853
Close, really close.

316
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:10,688
My stomach was so
upset, I almost

317
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:12,558
lost control of the jutsu.

318
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,360
Why did it have to
happen right then,

319
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:17,865
just when she was
about to-- huh?

320
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:19,634
(VOICEOVER) She thinks
that I'm annoying?

321
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,871
She said that three times.

322
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:25,675
I transform into Sasuke,
get close to Sakura,

323
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,710
and she has to say that?

324
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,713
Hey, I know what I should do.

325
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:32,216
I'll make Sasuke act
totally obnoxious.

326
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,452
Believe it.

327
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,221
Then she'll hate him
even more than me.

328
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,822
-Ah!

329
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,696
Oh, Sasuke, you're back.

330
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,500
Don't be so shy, you bad boy.

331
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,501
Are you ready now?

332
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:47,703
You know, mentally prepared?

333
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:48,671
Because I am.

334
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:50,607
I mean, I'm raring to go!

335
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,776
Uh, hey, wait a minute!

336
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,514
-Where's Naruto?

337
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:57,783
-Oh, see.

338
00:17:57,816 --> 00:17:59,518
There you go changing
the subject again.

339
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,522
Anyway, Naruto just
picks fights with you.

340
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:03,856
You know why he's so annoying?

341
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:05,225
Because he wasn't raised right.

342
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,860
He doesn't have a
mother or a father,

343
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:09,431
no one to teach him
right from wrong.

344
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,732
Think about it.

345
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:12,835
He just does whatever
comes into his head.

346
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:15,906
If I did things like
Naruto, forget it.

347
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:18,542
I mean, my parents would get
mad and I'd get in trouble.

348
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:20,144
So of course I don't do it.

349
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:23,716
But if you don't have parents
to tell you, how would you know?

350
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,085
He's selfish and bratty.

351
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,155
He's all alone.

352
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,023
-Alone.

353
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:30,257
Isolated.

354
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,559
-Huh?

355
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,094
-It's not about your
parents scolding you.

356
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,731
You have no idea what
it means to be alone.

357
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:39,569
-Wh-- why are you saying that?

358
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,939
-Because you're annoying.

359
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:44,876
-[gasps]

360
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,155
-Oh man.

361
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:56,758
I thought I was OK,
and then it came back.

362
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,960
I've got to hurry.

363
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:59,394
I hope Sakura's
still waiting for me.

364
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,469
Ah!

365
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:06,837
Sasuke, what are you doing here?

366
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,273
How did you get loose?

367
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:09,908
-I used the escape jutsu.

368
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,211
No sweat, it's a
very basic technique.

369
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:13,245
-Uh--

370
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,548
-Why'd you do that,
transform into me?

371
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:18,952
-I thought it'd be fun to try
out my moves on you, so I did.

372
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:25,094
-Ah, the same technique again?

373
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,731
-This time, you'll see
what I can really do.

374
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,099
You're going down for the count.

375
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:31,268
Then you'll have to
admit that I'm the best.

376
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:33,638
Get ready, Sasuke.

377
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,609
[passes gas]

378
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,513
[chattering]

379
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,361
[arguing]

380
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:52,362
-What a loser.

381
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,369
-(VOICEOVER) I'm annoying?

382
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:59,672
That's what he said.

383
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:01,541
Now I get it.

384
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:04,077
This is how Naruto must feel.

385
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,114
I shouldn't treat him like that.

386
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:10,252
Next time I see him,
I'm going to be nice.

387
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:11,219
NARUTO: Ugh.

388
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,020
-Huh?

389
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:13,990
-Maybe I ate something bad.

390
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:17,261
-(VOICEOVER) Oh, Naruto.

391
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:20,565
Smile, smile.

392
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:21,700
-Hey, Naruto!

393
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,369
Let's walk back
to class together.

394
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:24,503
-Did she really say that?

395
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:26,873
-[nervous laughter]

396
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,142
-(VOICEOVER) She'd never
smile at me like that.

397
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,714
Sasuke must've transformed
into Sakura to get back at me.

398
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:35,217
Trying to trick
me, eh, wise guy?

399
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,686
Well, forget it.

400
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,822
Ugh-- [passes gas]

401
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:43,595
Ugh, why is this
happening again?

402
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:44,596
Ah!

403
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:48,301
-Uh-- agh.

404
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,268
Dumb Naruto!

405
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:59,115
-So this is where Naruto lives.

406
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:02,352
-Yes, he'll be on your team,
along with Sakura and Sasuke

407
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,720
from the Uchiha Clan.

408
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,423
Good luck, you'll need it.

409
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:12,465
-This milk is way past
its expiration date.

410
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,005
One sip of this
and he'd be running

411
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,342
to the bathroom all day.

412
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,546
Seems like this kid's
just one big problem.

413
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,914
Hm.

414
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,050
-[groaning]

415
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:33,124
-Am I going to spend my
whole life on the <i>pot?</i>

416
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,792
[theme music]

417
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:13,176
NARUTO: This isn't the Kakashi
Sensei we met yesterday.

418
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:16,480
It couldn't be the same teacher
who I tricked so easily,

419
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:17,848
the one who came late to class.

420
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:19,250
Hah, no way.

421
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:22,288
I'm not giving up, no
matter what he throws at me.

422
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:25,492
A super tough test where we have
to defeat the sensei to pass?

423
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:26,693
I'll do it.

424
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,462
Nothing can make me go back now.

425
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,198
Believe it!

426
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:33,634
Next time, "Pass or
Fail: Survival Test."

427
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,434
Don't miss my big victory.
