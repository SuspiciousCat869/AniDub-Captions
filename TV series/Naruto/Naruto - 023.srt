00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:20,746
-Come on!

[speaking japanese]

4
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:09,047
-Glad you came, Sakura, for
your sake, and the others.

5
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,381
-Huh?

6
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:14,152
-Now, you can all formally
register for the Chunin Exam.

7
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,389
-Why?

8
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:18,557
What do you mean?

9
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,692
-You see, only
groups of three are

10
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,863
allowed to apply for,
and take the exam.

11
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,998
That's the way it's always been.

12
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:29,669
-But Sensei, you said the
decision to take the exam

13
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:31,437
was up to the individual.

14
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,572
-That's right.

15
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:33,373
I did.

16
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:36,009
-Was that a lie?

17
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,410
-Sort of.

18
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:41,948
It is an individual decision,
but it affects all of you.

19
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,750
I didn't tell you
before, because I

20
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:46,320
didn't want the other
guys pressuring you.

21
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:48,422
-Hmph.

22
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,457
-At the same time,
I didn't want you

23
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,560
feeling obliged to participate,
because of any feelings

24
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:57,131
you might have for
Sasuke, or Naruto.

25
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:01,168
I wanted you to come to a
decision of your own free will.

26
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,504
-Wait a minute.

27
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,039
Do you mean if the
others had shown but,

28
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:06,108
but I decided not
to come with them--

29
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,076
-It would've been
the end of the line.

30
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,345
If you hadn't come
along, I couldn't

31
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:12,280
have let the others in.

32
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:13,716
But it's a moot point.

33
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:16,519
You're all here, and
for the right reasons.

34
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:18,887
Sakura.

35
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:21,390
Naruto.

36
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,158
And Sasuke.

37
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,797
I'm proud of you.

38
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:31,000
I couldn't ask
for a better team.

39
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:32,236
Good luck.

40
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,371
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): We
won't let you down, Sensei!

-Gee, I guess we're not alone.

SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Man.

47
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:22,789
I had no idea there'd
be so much competition.

48
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,366
If being scary-looking
was one of the tests,

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,002
they've got me beat!

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,307
-Wha?

[giggling]

00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,977
-Boy, you have no
idea how much I

55
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,378
was hoping you'd show up here.

56
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:49,217
I've missed those brooding
good looks of yours.

Back off!

00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,654
He's mine!

61
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:53,655
-Miss Forehead!

62
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,257
They let you in?

63
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,960
Still got those big frown lines
on your billboard brow, I see.

64
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:00,462
-Leave my forehead out of it!

-Oh, it's you guys.

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,237
I knew this was gonna
be a drag, but I

69
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,072
didn't know it was
gonna be this lame.

70
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,107
-So all three stooges are here.

71
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,809
-Hey, you know what, pipsqueak?

72
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:13,944
Ah, forget it.

73
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:15,979
You're a waste of time.

74
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,380
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Shikamaru Nara.

75
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:19,983
Always complaining, never
does anything about it.

76
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,552
The laziest kid in the Academy.

Akimunchi's more like it.

80
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:32,897
I think he'd eat his
own head if he could.

81
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,267
-Sorry, but Sasuke's all mine.

[mocking]

83
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,470
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Ino Yamanaka.

84
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,039
Now she's annoying, and
not just because she's

85
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:44,943
got the same stupid thing
for Sasuke that Sakura's got.

86
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,912
-Well, what do you know?

87
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:49,615
It looks like the whole
gang's back together again.

00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:50,349
-(NERVOUSLY) Oh.

00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,117
Hi, Naruto.

90
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,419
-Hmm?

[gasps]

92
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,856
Hinata Hyuga.

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,892
She's OK, but I
don't know why she

94
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,695
gets all shy and embarrassed
every time I even, like,

95
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,629
look at her.

96
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,264
It's kind of weird.

97
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,635
Kiba Inuzuka and
his dog, Akamaru.

98
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,803
Forget what I said about Ino.

99
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,872
This guy's the most
annoying of all.

100
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,240
Thinks he's so cool.

101
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,345
Then there's Shino Aburame.

102
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,880
Well, he's just weird.

103
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,016
Kind of a mystery, but
that doesn't mean he

104
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,353
isn't annoying, too.

105
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,621
-You guys, too, huh?

106
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:27,856
Man.

107
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,090
Everyone's here for
this stupid thing.

108
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,225
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Yep.

109
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,492
Here we all are.

110
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:33,862
The nine rookies.

111
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,264
This is going to
be fun, at least,

112
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,967
for those of us good
enough to make the cut.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,736
Right, Sasuke?

114
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,772
-Kiba, careful you
don't get overconfident.

115
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:44,941
-Just wait.

116
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,676
We're going to
blow you guys away.

117
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:47,910
We've been training like crazy.

118
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:49,979
-What do you think
we've been doing?

119
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:51,748
Sitting around picking daisies?

120
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,883
You don't know what
training means!

121
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:54,717
[gasps]

122
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:56,453
-Don't mind Kiba.

123
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:58,856
I'm sure he didn't really
mean anything by it.

124
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,824
-Huh?

125
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:04,127
[whimpers]

126
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:06,229
CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
Akamaru's looking plumper.

127
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:07,665
Juicier.

00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,206
What's wrong?

131
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,613
-Thought maybe you
hadn't seen it.

132
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:22,647
-Huh?

133
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,649
-Didn't want you stepping on it.

134
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:25,550
-Why?

135
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:26,451
You saving it for lunch?

136
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:32,925
-Hey, you guys.

137
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,294
You might want to try
keeping it down a little.

138
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:38,831
I mean, no offense, but you're
the nine rookies, right?

139
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:42,335
Fresh out of the Academy?

140
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:45,605
I wouldn't go making a
spectacle of yourselves.

141
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:46,907
Just cool it.

142
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,209
This isn't a class field trip.

143
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:50,410
-Well, who asked you?

144
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:51,545
Who are you?

145
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:53,647
-I'm Kabuto Yakushi.

146
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,150
But really, look around you.

147
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:57,718
You've made quite an impression.

00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,006
See those guys?

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,474
They're from the Rain Village.

151
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:20,508
Very touchy.

152
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,210
They all are.

153
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:25,248
This exam makes
everyone tense, and you

154
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,950
don't want to rub them
the wrong way right now.

155
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:28,551
-Uh-uh.

156
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,656
-You can't help it.

157
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,558
I mean, how could you
know how things work?

158
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,527
You're just rookies.

159
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:40,864
You remind me of
myself a while back.

-Kabuto.

Is that your name?

-Yeah.

00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:46,536
-This isn't the first time
you've taken the exam?

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,407
No, it's-- my seventh.

-Huh?

they're held twice a year.

00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,113
So, this will be my fourth year.

168
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,948
-Wow, a veteran.

169
00:08:57,982 --> 00:09:00,585
You must really be
an expert by now.

170
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:01,920
-Yeah, sort of.

171
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:03,088
-Cool!

172
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,222
You can give us all
the inside tips.

173
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,456
-Yeah, some expert.

174
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,291
He's never passed.

175
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,594
-Well, seventh time's the charm.

176
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:09,928
That's what they say, huh?

177
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:13,064
-So I guess all of those rumors
about the exam being tough

178
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,366
are true.

179
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,369
Oh man, I knew this
was going to be a drag.

180
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:18,070
-Hang on.

181
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:19,638
Don't give up hope yet.

182
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:22,875
Maybe I can help you
kids out a little,

183
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,378
with my Ninja Info Cards.

184
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,247
-What the heck are those?

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,416
-It's hard to explain,
but these cards

186
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,151
have been chakra
encoded with everything

187
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:34,888
I've learned over
the past four years.

188
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,356
I've got more than 200 of them.

189
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,461
So you see, I haven't been
completely wasting my time.

190
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:43,063
They may not look like
much to the naked eye.

191
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,600
In fact, they appear blank.

192
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:49,603
Don't want just anyone
seeing this stuff.

193
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,305
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
What are you doing?

194
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,977
-You see, I'm using my chakra
to reveal their secrets,

195
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,313
like this, for example.

196
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,648
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Awesome!

197
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:00,882
A map!

198
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,451
INO (VOICEOVER): Of what?

199
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,586
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): It shows
the geographical distribution

200
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:07,522
of all the candidates who have
come to take the Chunin exam.

201
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,826
What villages they come from,
and how many from each village.

202
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,730
Why do you guys think
they all come here

203
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:18,034
to take the exam together,
at the same time?

204
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:24,374
[chewing]

205
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:28,044
-It's to foster friendship
between nations, of course.

206
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:29,713
International
brotherhood, and all that.

207
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:33,217
And it's true enough,
as far as it goes.

208
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,552
-But there's another reason.

209
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,788
-Yeah.

210
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,422
You see, the important
thing is that this way, they

211
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,492
can carefully regulate the
total number of Shinobi

212
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,394
that end up in each
village, thereby

213
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:44,862
maintaining the
balance of power.

214
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,097
-Oh, yeah.

215
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:49,334
Balance of power.

216
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,268
-Balance of power.

217
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,804
Big deal, it's all a drag.

218
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:55,774
-If the balance
isn't maintained,

219
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:58,344
one nation could wind up
with many more Shinobi

220
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:02,014
than its neighbors, and it
might be tempted to attack them.

221
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,883
So, they try to
maintain the status quo.

222
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:07,620
Makes sense, I suppose.

223
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:08,654
-Hmph.

224
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:10,557
-Do those cards of
yours have any info

225
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,993
on the other candidates,
individually?

226
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,529
-They might.

227
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:18,232
You have someone
special in mind?

228
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,399
-I might.

229
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,734
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Well, I can't

230
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,137
promise my information
is complete or perfect,

231
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,107
but I've got something
on just about everyone,

232
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,377
including you guys, of course.

233
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,545
So which one is it?

234
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,180
Tell me anything
you know about them.

235
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,214
A description.

236
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:35,083
Where they're from, whatever.

237
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,484
Anything at all.

238
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,619
-He's Gaara of the desert.

239
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:41,890
And there's Rock Lee of the
Leaf Village while you're at it.

240
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,024
-Man, that's no fun.

241
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:44,292
You even know their names.

242
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,394
That makes it easy.

243
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:52,168
Here they are.

244
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,136
-Show 'em to me.

245
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,571
-Hmm.

246
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:56,839
Hmm?

247
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:58,407
Mhmm-hmm.

248
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,777
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I haven't
a clue what's going on here.

249
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,779
But I'll act like I do.

250
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:03,480
-OK.

251
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,581
First up is Rock Lee.

252
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:11,488
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Looks like he's

253
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,791
about a year older
than you guys.

254
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:19,096
Mission experience, 11
C ranks and 20 D ranks.

255
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,999
His squad leader is Guy.

256
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,766
In the last 12
months, his taijutsu

257
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,171
has radically improved, but his
other skills are pretty shaky.

258
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,307
Last year, he got a lot
of attention as a Genin,

259
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,277
but for some
reason, he chose not

260
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,946
to participate in
the Chunin Exam.

261
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:38,583
This will be his first time as
a candidate, same as you guys.

262
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:41,520
His teammates are
Tenten and Neji Hyuga.

263
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:47,793
-Huh?

264
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,195
Hyuga?

265
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,196
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): OK.

266
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,831
Now for Gaara of the desert.

267
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:02,409
Mission experience, eight
C ranks, and-- Get this.

268
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:04,878
One B rank as a Genin.

269
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:07,548
There's not a lot more
information on this guy.

270
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:10,284
He was a rookie from
another land, originally,

271
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,755
but there is this.

272
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:16,958
He survived every mission
without getting a scratch

273
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,125
on him.

274
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,262
-The dude's done a
B rank as a Genin,

275
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:23,431
and has never even been injured?

276
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,033
-What's the deal with this guy?

277
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:42,218
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Leaf, Sand,
Rain, Grass, Waterfall, Sound.

278
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,887
From the looks of
it, they've all

279
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,022
sent exceptionally
skilled candidates

280
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,625
to the exam this time around.

281
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:51,961
Of course, the hidden
Sound Village is small.

282
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,230
It sprang up recently.

283
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:54,664
No one knows anything about it.

284
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,166
Those guys are a mystery.

285
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,572
-Well, you get the point.

286
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:04,208
The competition's going
to be intense this year.

287
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,676
-So it would seem.

288
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,812
It's almost enough to make
you lose your confidence.

289
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:11,182
-It's a fine time to
start talking like that!

290
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:14,686
-Do you really think it's
going to be tougher this time?

291
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,221
-Oh, yeah.

292
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,223
In the four years
I've been coming,

293
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:20,292
I've never seen a
crop of candidates

294
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,694
with as much potential
as this bunch.

295
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,395
[growls]

296
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,530
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Yep.

297
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,965
We've got our work
cut out for us.

298
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,737
-I can't go along with this.

299
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,073
They may be under your care now,
Kakashi, but I know these kids.

300
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,074
They were my students.

301
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,609
I trained them.

302
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,311
I don't know what you're trying
to prove with this, but--

303
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,448
-You know, he may
be right, Kakashi.

304
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,984
You're putting a lot
of pressure on them.

305
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,786
Why so impatient?

306
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,957
I held my team back for a year,
so they could hone their skills

307
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,425
and mature.

308
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,030
Let them enjoy their
youth a little longer.

309
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,798
-Your concern is touching.

310
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,600
You sure it's not
just because you

311
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,337
know your guys don't stand
a chance against mine?

312
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:04,305
-All right.

313
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,707
All right, that's enough.

314
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,043
The matter of the rookies'
participation is closed.

315
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:12,514
Now, as for the other
Genin, I'm ready to consider

316
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,349
your recommendations.

317
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:16,451
-I know what I'm doing.

318
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,152
You'll see.

319
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:22,425
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I wish
I was as sure as I sounded.

320
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,093
I wonder how they're doing.

321
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:26,847
Even the cockiest of 'em
must be a little scared.

322
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,789
[shivering]
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): OK.

323
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:31,791
So we're just rookies,
and most of these guys

324
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:34,927
are older and more
experienced than we are.

325
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,995
No big deal.

326
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:38,999
It's OK to be a little scared.

327
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:40,466
I can handle it.

328
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,602
But it'd be a whole
lot easier if I

329
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:45,772
didn't have to watch Naruto tell
falling apart right in front

330
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:46,740
of me.

331
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:49,843
I mean, nothing
usually gets to him.

332
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,445
Poor guy.

333
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:54,215
Maybe I can try to cheer him up.

334
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:55,082
-Hey.

335
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,050
Don't worry, Naruto.

336
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:56,783
We'll be fine.

337
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:07,729
[screams]

338
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:10,899
-My name is Naruto
Uzumaki, and I'm

339
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,868
gonna beat every one of you.

340
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:14,269
Believe it!

341
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:18,006
[chuckles]

342
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,176
-Hey, what's that idiot
trying to do, get us killed?

343
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,345
-I should have known.

344
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:23,946
He's not smart
enough to be scared.

345
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:26,749
-Tell your boyfriend to
keep his big fat trap shut!

346
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:27,917
-Whose boyfriend?

347
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:28,752
-Oh, I forgot.

348
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,386
You can't get one!

349
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,555
-What'd you say?

350
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,321
-Yeah!

351
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:34,257
I feel a lot better now.

352
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,760
-Hmm.

353
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:37,361
-Hmm.

354
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,599
-Hmm.

355
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:45,269
That's the same kid
as before, isn't it?

356
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:48,205
-He yips just like a little dog.

357
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:49,540
-What a jerk!

358
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,942
-Well, he sure hasn't
lost any of his spunk.

359
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,511
-He has passion.

360
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,946
-I guess you didn't intimidate
him as much as you thought,

361
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:56,647
huh, Lee?

362
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,954
ZAKU (VOICEOVER): You heard what
he said about the hidden Sound

363
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,822
Village?

364
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,056
He called us little.

365
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,025
A mystery.

366
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,660
DOSU (VOICEOVER): I heard.

367
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,031
-I say, we teach this
guy some manners.

368
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,365
-Yeah.

369
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,302
Time to clear up some
of the mystery for him.

370
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,070
Update his information.

371
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:22,008
Let him know that if you
insult the Sound Shinobi,

372
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,411
you'd better be ready
for the consequences.

373
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,457
-Uh, can you say that
again a little louder?

374
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,191
Didn't quite catch it.

375
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,793
-You moron.

376
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,196
Are you trying to get everybody
in the place to hate our guts,

377
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,863
or what?

378
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,564
[laughing]

379
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,867
-Naruto, you jackass!

380
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,001
[screaming]

381
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,370
Why'd you have to go and
say something like that?

382
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,840
You obnoxious little--

383
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:53,342
Oh, hi, everyone.

384
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,709
Don't mind him.

385
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,445
Sometimes he says
these spazzy things.

386
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,646
He doesn't really mean them.

387
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,813
They just kinda come out.

388
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,215
He's got this
condition, you know.

389
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:01,717
Kind of a psychological thing.

390
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:04,153
He really should
be on medication.

391
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:05,454
Now see what you've
done, Naruto?

392
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,156
You've hurt
everybody's feelings.

393
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,491
They think you
don't respect them.

394
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,193
But that isn't
true, is it Naruto?

395
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,327
DOSU (VOICEOVER): You ready?

396
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:12,728
ZAKU (VOICEOVER): Let's do it.

397
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,519
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Would you
just for once in your life

398
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:37,254
think about what you're doing?

399
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:38,823
Think about the rest of us!

400
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,193
-Fine.

401
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:41,793
-Huh?

402
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:50,502
[gasps]

403
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:52,370
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
They're from the village

404
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,907
hidden in the Sound.

405
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,910
[gasps]

406
00:18:57,943 --> 00:18:59,845
NARUTO AND SAKURA
(VOICEOVER): Man, he's fast.

407
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,115
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He's
almost as quick as me.

408
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:03,116
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

409
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:15,462
[glasses cracking]

410
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:16,596
-Oh, I get it.

411
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,065
So it was that kind of attack.

412
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,469
-Hang on, I saw it all.

413
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,004
He dodged the attack.

414
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,573
How did that happen?

415
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,443
-It must have come
closer than it looked.

416
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,311
Look at him acting
like it was nothing.

417
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:31,246
Real tough guy.

418
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:42,424

[retching]

00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:43,592
-What?

421
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,493
Did he just?

422
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,996
-Kabuto, what's wrong?

423
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,997
What is it?

424
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,310
-Heh.

425
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,378
-Hey, Kabuto.

426
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:03,246
-Are you OK?

427
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,947
-Yeah.

428
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,148
I'm fine.

429
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:06,449
-Are you sure?

430
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:09,753
-Not such a tough guy,
after all, I guess.

431
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:12,723
Maybe that's why he's
on his seventh try.

432
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,958
ZAKU (VOICEOVER): Write this
on your little card, punk.

433
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,627
The Genin from the
Sound Village will

434
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,562
be Chunin when this is over.

435
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,298
Guaranteed.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I don't get it.

439
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:27,171
He saw their attack
in time to avade it.

440
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,206
What made him fall apart?

441
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:36,015
-Hey, Lee, what was going
on with that attack?

442
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,118
-There was more to
it than just speed.

443
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,020
some kind of trick.

444
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:41,621
-Hmm.

445
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,692
IBIKI (VOICEOVER): All right,
you baby face degenerates.

00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:48,228
Pipe down and listen up.

447
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:02,609
It's time to begin.

I'm Ibiki Marino, your proctor.

Motivate your anger to

Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

like I was twelve.

Sneaking out the classroom
by the back door.

A man railed at me,
though, but I didn't care.

Waiting is wasting,
for people like me.

Don't try to live so wise.

Don't cry, 'cause

Now it's time to walk the walk.
