00:01:58,529 --> 00:01:59,796
-Still no sign.

3
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,529
Where in the world
are you, Idate?

4
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,863
-Sir.

5
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,796
That matter you asked
us to investigate.

6
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,596
We finally uncovered some proof.

7
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,396
-Oh.

8
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:12,896
I see.

9
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:16,529
Good.

10
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:19,329
Well done.

11
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:20,329
-M'lord.

12
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:21,529
Is something wrong?

13
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:22,729
-It's fine.

14
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:23,929
Nothing to worry about.

15
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:26,763

SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I
have to focus my chakra.

17
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,396
That was really close.

18
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,363
Sasuke.

19
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,096
Are you OK?

20
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,563
Naruto.

21
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,463
Good luck.

22
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:21,596
You'll have to protect Idate.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
The Last Leg.

A Final Act of Desparation!

25
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:33,196
Hate to break it to you, but
your poison won't work on me.

26
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:34,463
-Heh.

27
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:35,663
-Go on, laugh.

28
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,696
You're gonna pay for what
you did to my friends.

29
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:38,896
-Take it easy.

30
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,929
I wouldn't want you
feeling left out.

31
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,863
You'll join them soon enough.

32
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,029

of that, if I were you!

IDATE (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What do I do?

35
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:59,329
Rasengan won't work
against that sword.

36
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,429
That doesn't matter now!

37
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:04,096
Sakura and Sasuke
need me to help them!

38
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,029
-Ha.

39
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,196
Still want to play
the hero, huh?

40
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:10,263
Forget about it. they were
dead once they hit bottom.

41
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:11,729
-Zip it!

42

Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

-Well.

44
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,663
Not a bad trick there, kid.

45
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,896
But it's not gonna
help you run away.

46
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,763
-Whatever, pal.

47
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,263
Who said anything about running?

48
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:45,529
-Huh?

49
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,463
-It's useless, Naruto!

50
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:54,929
That Jutsu won't work on him!

51
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:55,929
-Better listen.

52
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,763
-Naruto!

53
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:11,729
-You're no better than
than that Uchiha failure.

54
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:16,596
Is there anyone in Hidden Leaf
who's not a complete idiot?

55
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:18,329
-Shut up already.

56
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:20,329
I'm saving them, you hear me?

57
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,063
-You don't honestly think
they're alive after that fall,

58
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,163
do you?

59
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:27,129
You should've run while
you had the chance.

60
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:27,896
-I won't.

61
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,363
I won't abandon my friends.

62
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:36,729
I'll never run away!

63
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:40,996
I haven't forgotten my
answer to the tenth question!

64
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,329
-What are you even
talking about?

65
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:46,496
-One more time.

66
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,996
Take this!

67
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:51,463
-You little fool.

68
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:51,963
-Rasengan!

69
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,229
-Naruto!

70
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,896
-You still don't get it.

71
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,263
You have no chance of winning.

72
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,229
-Damn it.

73
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,629
What is that?

74
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,063
Sasuke must've
made a crack in it.

75
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:40,563
That's it.

76
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:44,063
I just aim for that.

77
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,529
I can win!

78
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:46,229
-What?

79
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:47,496
Haven't had enough yet?

80
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,296
Come on, kid.

81
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:49,629
Give it up already.

82
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,596
-Aw, shut up!

83
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,129
Shadow Clone Justu!

84
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,396
This is it!

85
00:06:56,429 --> 00:07:01,229
Sasuke gave me this chance,
and I'm not gonna waste it!

86
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:01,729
-Naruto.

87
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,729
-Just hold still!

88
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,729
Sasuke!

89
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:15,229
They changed into water clones!

90
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:17,729
-I know!

91
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,696
-You've gotta trust me, Idate.

92
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:24,229
I promise we'll protect you.

93
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:26,229
-Sa-- Sakura.

94
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:28,229
-Hurry, go on ahead.

95
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:32,696
I promise we'll be
right behind you.

96
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:34,696
-Sakura!

97
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:35,696
-Idate!

98
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,196
-Gotta do something.

99
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,496
-This is bordering
on ridiculous.

100
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,529
I've always hated
people who don't

101
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,129
know when they should quit.

102
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,029
-This is as far as you go.

103
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,396
-Hm?

104
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:56,463
Enough of your cheap tricks.

105
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:05,629
What the-- Hm.

106
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:09,096
That's enough heroism for one
day, don't you think, Idate?

107
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:13,329
NARUTO: Over here, pal!

108
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:15,796
We're not finished!

109
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,629
Up here!

110
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:21,163
Rasengan!

111
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,863
-This can't be happening!

[shouting]

113
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:54,229

114
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:55,229
You did it!

115
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,129
-Naruto.

116
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:01,929
I don't believe it.

117
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:03,063
That was really incredible.

118
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,296
-Yeah, well-- Sakura!

119
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:13,496
SAKURA: Naruto!

120
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:13,996
Idate!

121
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,629
-Sakura's all right.

122
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,763
-She's still alive.

123
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:21,729
-And don't worry.

124
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:23,629
Sasuke's fine!

125
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,663
-Hold on!

126
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,663
I'll have to out of
there in no time!

127
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:27,796
SAKURA: You idiot!

128
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:29,896
Forget about us and just
get to the finish line!

129
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,763
Time is running out!

130
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,429
-Oh yeah, that's right.

131
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,429
But what the heck
do we do about this?

132
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:38,263
-Leave it to me.

133
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,163
If we cut the rope, we'll
be on the other side

134
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:45,429
in about two seconds.

135
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:47,663
-Uh, yeah, I got you.

136
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:55,796
-You know, I-- I've never really
thought that highly of myself.

137
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,796
But even when I
didn't, Boss Jirocho

138
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,296
always put his faith in me.

139
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,563
-The Wasabi family has
complete faith in you.

140
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:04,929
I have faith in you.

141
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,763
IDATE: That never
happened before.

142
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:10,263
No one ever trusted
me with anything.

143
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,863
And that's exactly why I wanted
to win this race for him,

144
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,596
no matter what was
standing in my way.

145
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:19,129
But it turns out just
wanting it wasn't enough.

146
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:22,096
There were so many times
I almost lost hope.

147
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,063
-Watch out!

148
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,429
IDATE: But whenever
that happened,

149
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:26,929
you guys risked
your lives for me,

150
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:29,196
no matter how
useless I'd become.

151
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,196
-Hang on tight.

152
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,363
Here we go!

153
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:34,896
Naruto, forgive me.

154
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,329
I should have trusted you
guys right from the beginning.

155
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,729
-So, what are you
telling me this now for?

156
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,396
Save that kind of
stuff for after you've

157
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,129
crossed the finish line.

158
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:45,729
-Yeah.

159
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:46,429
You're right.

160
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:49,329
Here.

161
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:49,963
Use this.

162
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,729
-Idate!

163
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,496
-Now, let's do it.

164
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:03,929
-OK!

We're heading straight
for the rocks!

-Yeah, I know!

174
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:50,465
Don't worry, I'm on it!

175
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,898
Gotta focus chakra to
the bottom of my feet.

176
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,365
For cryin' out loud, I'm
almost out of chakra!

177
00:11:58,865 --> 00:11:59,831
Come on, now.

178
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,631

Now hurry up and get
to the finish line!

182
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,998
-Sit tight, Sakura!

183
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:17,398
I'll be back to help
before you know it, OK?

184
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:18,098
All right.

185
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,765
Let's get going, Idate.

186
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:20,265
-Right!

187
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,798
-Come on.

Keep runnin', Fukusuke!

-Don't let up 'til
the race is over!

190
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,998
-Aw, shut up.

191
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:35,298
Tell me something I don't know.

192
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,165
Stupid idiots.

193
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,398
This is my big moment.

194
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:39,431
What are they trying
to do, ruin it?

195
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,365
MAN: Hurry up!

196
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:44,765
-Finally.

197
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,731
There's the great
Todoroki Shrine up ahead.

198
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,398
-Well, this is it.

-Oh, no.

-Here he comes!

It's Idate from
the Wasabi family!

What are you doing, Fukusuke?

213
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:32,698
Come on!

214

-I'm not gonna lose.

215
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,198
No matter what happens,
I am not going to lose!

I'm not giving up 'til
the end of the end!

-Forget it!

218
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:55,998
No one's pulling
ahead of me now.

219
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:57,831
Not after I've
come all this way.

220

He's right on top of me!

I won't lose, y little runt!

Keep going!

That was a good race, son.

You did very well.

-Please, sir, forgive me.

00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:43,265
I'm truly sorry.

-Why apologize?

242
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:46,665
You are the winner of the race.

You do realize that, don't you?

244

-No.

Please, boss, let me speak.

I beg of you-- I really
want to apologize.

I'm truly sorry.

You really are an
odd one, aren't you?

finally did it.

-Hold on.

00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:53,798
That's enough.

273
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:54,331
-Huh?

274
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,565
Kyuroku?

275
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,665
-It seems this kid rode on
the back of a hired ninja

276
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,365
for part of the way.

277
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,165
That's a violation.

278
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:03,331
-What did you say?

279
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,198
-I have proof.

280
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,431
Just take a look at
this photograph, huh?

281
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,698
They have to make it here
by their own strength.

282
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:15,831
Those are the
rules of this race.

283
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:19,731
The boy must be disqualified.

284
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:23,631
Which means that Fukusuke
Hikyakuya of the Wagarashi

285
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,765
family is the winner.

00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:26,665
It can't be!

288
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:27,965
-But wait a minute.

289
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:28,798
That was--

290
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,798
-I'll hear none of your excuses.

291
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:32,965
Jirocho, you gave your word.

292
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,265
I want the Wasabi a family
to disband immediately.

293
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,898
-Just a moment.

294
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,698
There is no such rule.

295
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,265
Stop talking nonsense.

296
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:44,731
-But-- my lord!

297
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,231
-But what?

298
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,798
Are you suggesting I let
the Wagarashi win simply

299
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,065
because you wish it?

300
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:51,898
-No.

301
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,165
Of course not.

302
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,198
-Perhaps the reason you
want to win so badly

303
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,398
is that it would mean an
end to all the bribes you've

304
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,065
been accepting.

305
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,931
Look here.

306
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,631
You ignoramous.

307
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,398
you'll give up your position
and don a monk's robe.

308
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:09,098
-Yes-- Yes, sir.

309
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,231
-And you, Kyuroku.

310
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,431
-Yes?

311
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,198
-I have heard a great
deal about the evil deeds

312
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:15,498
you have committed.

313
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:18,065
Your crimes against the
people of Port Degarashi

314
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,598
are unforgivable.

315
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,065
From this day forth, the
Wagarashi family is no more.

316
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,065
Is that clear?

00:18:58,565 --> 00:18:59,598
-OK.

330
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:01,265
Let's get him on the boat, then.

331

00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,398
Right.

340
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:24,665
Only one person called me that.

00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,198
And he died three years ago.

342
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,998
IDATE (VOICEOVER): Big brother.

343
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,565
I've figured out the answer
to the 10th question.

344
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:43,698
I'll never betray
a comrade again.

345
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:46,165
I know what it means
now to trust in others.

346
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,298
IBIKI (VOICEOVER):
You've grown up well.

347
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:07,931
-So long, Idate!

348
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,398
See you again someday!

349
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:10,831
-Yeah, we'll see you.

350
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:11,765
You take care.

351
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,098
-You got it.

352
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,965
You guys come back any time.

353
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:17,298
-Hey boss, take care
of yourself, OK?

354
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:19,765
-Yeah.

355
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,431
-Buh bye!

356
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:22,398
-So long!

357
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:28,331
IBIKI (VOICEOVER): Always
interesting, this kid.

358
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:32,831
It's no wonder the Fifth Hokage
has taken a shine to him.

359
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:33,665
-Naruto!

360
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,831
Thanks again!

361
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:37,098
-Idate!

362
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:40,531
Next time I see you, we'll
have to spar a little!

363
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:45,398
-Sasuke.

364
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,865
Does it hurt?

365
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:48,065
-No, it doesn't.

366
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,231
-Oh good.

367
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,565
Don't worry.

368
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,998
Those wounds will heal once
we get back to the village.

369
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:53,498
-Sure.

370
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,665
AOI (VOICEOVER): I see
that the stories are true.

371
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:01,465
I'd always heard that the
last of the great Uchia clan

372
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:05,098
was a hopeless loser
unworthy of his family name.

373
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,265
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I
wasn't able to beat him.

374
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:12,331
But Naruto-- Naruto was.

375
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,192

376
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,959
SAKURA: Sasuke, Naruto.

377
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:06,192
What's happened to both of you?

378
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:06,859
Come on.

379
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:08,959
This is a hospital.

380
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:10,659
Sasuke's recouperating.

381
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:12,859
You should know better, Naruto.

382
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,692
Stop messing around already.

383
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:16,759
Geez, what is this?

384
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,192
Why is this happening?

385
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,692
NARUTO: Next time,
The Battle Begins!

386
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:25,559
Naruto Versus Sasuke!

387
