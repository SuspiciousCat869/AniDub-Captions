-What are you doing now?

335
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,435
You know, you won't get lunch
unless you take a bell by noon.

336
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:44,572
-(ANGRILY) I know.

337
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:45,238
I know.

338
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,507
You told us already!

339
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,342
KAKASHI: You look pretty
wobbly for someone

340
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:50,813
who's going to
surpass the Hokage.

341

[stomach growling]

342
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,850
-(ANGRILY) You told us
not to eat breakfast!

343
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:57,522
How can I fight when
I'm starving to death?

344
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:58,456
[stomach growling]

345
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,658
-(VOICEOVER) Breakfast?

346
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,029
I didn't even have
dinner last night.

347
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,301
Really bad idea to go on a diet.

348
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,103
-So, you caught me off guard.

349
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:09,305
That's all it was.

350
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,240
Believe it.

351
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:13,543
I'm so hungry I don't
have any strength.

352
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:15,113
But I can't let that stop me.

353
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,548
I've got to get one of
those bells no matter what.

354
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:19,819
I'll find the strength somehow.

355
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:20,886
Believe it.

356
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,423
I'm going to pass
this test, and I'm not

357
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:24,692
going back to the Academy.

358
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,734
I will become a ninja!

359
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:35,906
-Hm.

360
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,514
[laughing]

361
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,116
-(YELLING) You're
overconfident, Sensei.

362
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:46,188
That's why you weren't ready for
a shadow clone attack-- my best

363
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,189
jutsu.

364
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,157
-(VOICEOVER) Seven Narutos?

365
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,365
What?

366
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:55,132
They're not images.

367
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,101
They're real.

368
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:57,970
How could he do that?

369
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:02,777
-Hm.

370
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,478
[yelling]

371
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,582
It look like the
stories are true.

372
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:09,952
He can create shadow clones.

373
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:14,426
-If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you.

374
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,828
-Show me what you can
do, nine-tail fox!

375
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:25,106
-(VOICEOVER) Those
aren't just illusions.

376
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:27,310
They're solid clones.

377
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:30,880
He's mastered an
extremely advanced jutsu.

378
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,482
-(VOICEOVER) It's
a forbidden skill,

379
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:36,923
and he defeated Mizuki with it.

380
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,190
Great technique.

381
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,461
But I don't think you can
maintain it for very long.

382
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,464
You talk like you're
the best, Naruto,

383
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,669
but you're still
the worst student.

384
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:50,506
You can't beat me
with this jutsu.

385
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,508
[bell ringing]

386
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,044
(VOICEOVER) What?

387
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:56,214
He got me from behind.

388
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,217
Huh?

389
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:58,918
-Oh.

390
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,121
[laughing]

391
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:03,524
-Didn't you say don't let
your enemies get behind you?

392
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,426
Good advice, Sensei.

393
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,495
Believe it.

394
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,831
I had one of my clones
come out of the river,

395
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:13,072
then sneak up behind
you super quiet.

396
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:15,707
Now, this is for nailing
me in the butt earlier!

397
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,011
-(VOICEOVER) When did
Naruto get so cool?

398
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:21,815
-(VOICEOVER) A
diversionary tactic , nice.

so are those bells!

-Huh?

404
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,176
SAKURA: He's holding himself.

405
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,916
Naruto punched Naruto.

00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,986
-Ouch!

408
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,955
It's you!

409
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,426
You're Kakashi
Sensei, aren't you?

410
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:56,863
You transformed into
me using a jutsu!

411
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:57,631
You are!

412
00:18:57,664 --> 00:18:58,798
You're Kakashi Sensei!

413
00:18:58,832 --> 00:18:59,333
You are!

414
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,668
Believe it.

415
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:01,970
You smell like an old
man, you must be him!

416
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:02,704
No, you are!

417
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:04,173
You're Kakashi Sensei!

418
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:05,241
No, you are!

419
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,143
Hey!

420
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,177
Let's undo the jutsu!

421
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,111
Yeah, that's it!

422
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,480
Believe it.

423
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:12,117
Then there will just be two of
us, so we'll know who's who.

424
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,086
Should have thought
of that sooner, fool.

425
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:14,888
You're the jerk.

426
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,422
Why didn't you think of it?

427
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,924
Just undo the jutsu!

428
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:21,997
Ow.

429
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:28,205
-(VOICEOVER) Naruto,
you are so not cool.

430
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:30,609
-(VOICEOVER) He got you
with a replacement jutsu.

431
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:32,010
Loser.

432
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:34,681
With this jutsu, you
quickly switch your own body

433
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,884
with an object, so
your enemy thinks

434
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,620
he's attacking you when he's
actually attacking a log

435
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:42,959
or rock, leaving him
open to a counterattack.

436
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:46,230
In this case, the Jonin let
himself get caught, then

437
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,599
switched bodies with one
of the Naruto clones.

438
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:50,836
So Naruto thought
he was nailing him,

439
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:54,107
but actually he was
just attacking himself.

440
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,543
And that Jonin was
so smooth, he made

441
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:59,347
Naruto look like a total moron.

A bell?

445
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,226
I must have got to
him with my attack.

446
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,128
He dropped a bell!

Hey!

451
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,105
Let me down!

452
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,107
What is this?

453
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,410
-(VOICEOVER) Of
course it was a trap.

454
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,745

Somebody!

-(VOICEOVER) That Jonin doesn't
let down his guard even when

458
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,555
he's fighting a
fool like Naruto.

459
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:30,189
NARUTO: Help!

460
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,023
Come on!

461
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:32,058

00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,206
might use it against you.

-(ANGRILY) I get it!

-I'm telling you this
because you don't get it.

473
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,865
You think you get
it, which is not

474
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,103
the same as actually getting it.

475
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:05,936
Get it?

476
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,007
-(VOICEOVER) This is my chance.

477
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,614
He finally dropped his guard!

487
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,435
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Man, at this rate,

488
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:10,304
there's no way I can
beat Kakashi Sensei.

489
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:13,141
But if I don't get a
bell, I fail the test,

490
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,311
and that is not an option.

491
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:18,115
He keeps saying see
through deception,

492
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,287
which I would do if I had any
idea what he was talking about,

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,420
but I don't.

494
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:26,721
So how do I get my hands
on one of those bells?

495
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,888
Next time-- "You Failed!

496

Kakashi's Final Decision."

497
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:34,302
It might look bad, but
don't count me out!
