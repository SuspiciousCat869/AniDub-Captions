00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,100
NARRATOR: 12 years ago, a nine
tailed fox suddenly appeared.

2
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,266
Its tails lashed out,
smashing mountains and sending

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,100
tidal waves crashing
to the shores.

4
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:31,466
The ninja rose up to
defend their villages.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,933
-Hold the attack and wait
for the fourth Hokage!

6
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,000
-It's getting closer!

7
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,733
Don't let it near the village!

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,066
NARRATOR: One shinobi
faced the nine tailed fox

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,133
in mortal combat.

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,066
He sacrificed his life
to capture the beast

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,100
and seal it in a human body.

12
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:56,233
This ninja was known
as the Fourth Hokage.

13
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:04,296
[baby crying]

14
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,396
-[laughing]

15
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,930
-Naruto, come back here!

16
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:16,951
When I get my hands on you!

17
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:20,885
-You've crossed the
line this time, Naruto!

18
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:24,818
-[laughing]

19
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,185
-Give it up!

20
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,551
You're just bent
because you don't

21
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:30,585
have the guts to do what I do!

22
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:31,218
Do you?

23
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:31,718
Losers!

24
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:32,851
Wannabes!

25
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,685
You'll never catch
me! [laughing]

26
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:36,585
-Lord Hokage!

27
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,451
It's an emergency!

28
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:41,118
-I hope you're not bothering
me with some trivia.

29
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,551
And don't tell me
it's Naruto again.

30
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:44,785
-It is Naruto again!

31
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,685
He climbed onto the
great stone faces!

32
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:50,285
-He put graffiti
all over the Hokage.

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,285
-[sigh]

34
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,251
-Naruto!

35
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,018
-Hold on!

36
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,651
-[laughing]

37
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,551
-That was too easy.

38
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,918
-Oh yeah, Naruto?

39
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,018
-[screaming]

40
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,651
-Where'd you come
from, Iruka-sensei?

41
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:16,985
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,485
-No, what are you doing here?

43
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,785
You're supposed to be in class.

44
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,885
I'm at the end of
my rope, Naruto.

45
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:26,151
You failed the
graduation test last time

46
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:27,818
and the time before that.

47
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,551
Tomorrow, you've
got another chance,

48
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,385
and you're messing up again.

49
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,051
-Hmph!

50
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,085
Fine!

51
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,151
Because you missed
it, Naruto, everyone

52
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:39,385
will review the
transformation jutsu!

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,051
-Aww.

54
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,551
-All right, Sakura here.

55
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:43,885
Let's do it.

56
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,951
Transform!

57
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,285
-You transformed into me.

58
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:47,885
Good.

59
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:51,651
-Yes!

60
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:52,918
I did it!

61
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,451
-I kicked butt!

62
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,418
-Yes!

63
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,818
Sasuke, did you see that?

64
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,585
-Next, Sasuke Uchiha.

65
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,651
Uh, good.

66
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,018
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.

67
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:14,151
-This is a total
waste of time, Naruto.

68
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,818
-We always pay for
your screw-ups.

69
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:17,885
-Like I care.

70
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:24,285
-Naruto.

71
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,518
Do your best.

72
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,118
-Transform!

73
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,051
-Ooh. [giggle]

74
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:34,516
-Huh?

75
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,068
-[laughing] Gotcha!

76
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,868
That's my sexy jutsu!

77
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,101
-Cut the stupid tricks!

78
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:46,001
This is your last warning!

79
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,334
-This sucks.

80
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,468
Loser.

81
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,601
-You're not going home
until you've cleaned off

82
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,768
every single drop of paint.

83
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,201
-So what?

84
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,234
It's not like there's anyone
waiting at home for me!

85
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,434
-Naruto?

86
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,701
-What do you want now, sensei?

87
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:26,001
-Well, I was just thinking.

88
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,934
Maybe after you
clean this all up,

89
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,601
I could take you
out for some ramen.

90
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:30,401
The good stuff.

91
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:33,201
What do you think?

92
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,668
-Huh?

93
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,034
Now that's some
serious motivation!

94
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:40,001
I'll have this clean in no time!

95
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,568
Enter Naruto Uzumaki!

96
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,301
-Naruto.

97
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,401
-Hm?

98
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:59,268
-Why would you do that
to the Hokage faces?

99
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,301
I mean, you know who the
Hokage are, don't you?

100
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:06,368
-Course I do. [slurping]

101
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,634
Everybody knows.

102
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,701
They were the greatest
shinobi of their time, right?

103
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,768
The best of the best.

104
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,201
Undefeated ninja champs.

105
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,701
And the Fourth
Hokage's the one who

106
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:23,068
saved the village from
the nine tailed fox.

107
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,434
He was the most amazing.

108
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:26,834
-Then why did you--

109
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,568
-Because I'm going to be
greater than any of them.

110
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:30,501
Me.

111
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,434
Naruto.

112
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,201
The next Hokage!

113
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,001
A ninja legend!

114
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,901
Then everyone will have
to stop disrespecting me

115
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,668
and look up to me.

116
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,268
Believe it!

117
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:45,768
Uh, by the way, I kind of want
to ask a little favor, sensei.

118
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,434
-You want another bowl?

119
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,468
-Uh-uh.

120
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,768
I want to try on your headband.

121
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,368
Come on, please?

122
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,401
-Oh, this?

123
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:54,668
No way.

124
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,268
You can only wear
the Leaf headband

125
00:05:56,301 --> 00:06:00,068
when you finally graduate from
the Academy and become a ninja.

126
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:02,268
You've got to pass
the test tomorrow.

127
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,401
-That is so uncool!

128
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,601
-Hey, is that why you
took off your goggles?

129
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,234
-I want another bowl!

130
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,301
-We will now start
the final exam.

131
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:16,268
When your name is called,
proceed to the testing room.

132
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:19,734
The final test will
be on the clone jutsu.

133
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:23,401
-Ugh, that's my worst technique!

134
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:24,068
Great!

135
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,568
I'm never gonna pass!

136
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:30,868
All right.

137
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:32,234
Get it together, Naruto.

138
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,201
You can do this.

139
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:33,683
Believe it.

140
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:38,434
Clone jutsu!

141
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,634
You fail!

142
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,601
-Iruka-sensei.

143
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:57,768
He's off, but his moves weren't
bad, and he did hang in there

144
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,968
and replicate.

145
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,768
This is his third
try, so you know

146
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,234
he really wants
to become a ninja.

147
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:05,034
We could cut him a
break and pass him.

148
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,434
-Mizuki-sensei,
the other students

149
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,568
created at least three
effective replications.

150
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,734
But Naruto could only
create one, and look at it.

151
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,401
It's pitiful.

152
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,401
I can't pass him.

153
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,568
-[growling]

154
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:24,268
[interposing voices]

155
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,234
-There.

156
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,868
You see him?

157
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,234
It's that boy.

158
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,734
I heard he's the
only one who failed.

159
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:43,701
-Hmph.

160
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:45,101
Well, it serves him right.

161
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,934
-Just imagine what would
happen if he became a ninja.

162
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,268
I mean, he's the boy who--

163
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,301
-Shh.

164
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,601
We're not allowed
to talk about that.

165
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:05,001
-Iruka, there's something
we need to talk about.

166
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:15,701
-Iruka-sensei's tough,
but he's not against you.

167
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:16,501
-Then why?

168
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,801
Why only me?

169
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,834
-He wants you to be
strong with all his heart,

170
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:26,001
but that will never happen
if he goes easy on you.

171
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:27,668
He's like you, you know?

172
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:30,034
No parents, no family.

173
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:34,301
-But this time, I really
wanted to graduate.

174
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:37,968
--[laughs] Then I guess
I have to tell you.

175
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:45,201
It's a secret, but I'm
going to let you in on it.

176
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:45,683
-A secret?

177
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,834
-Iruka.

178
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,734
-What is it, Lord Hokage?

179
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,768
-I know how you feel.

180
00:08:56,801 --> 00:09:00,101
You grew up just like
Naruto, without knowing

181
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,468
the love of a mother and father.

182
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,401
The warmth of a family.

183
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:08,468
-It's getting closer!

184
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:09,668
Don't let it near the village!

185
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,134
-Let me go!

186
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:15,268
My mom and dad are still
fighting back there! [screams]

187
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,668
[knocking]

188
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,468
-Iruka-sensei, wake up.

189
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,601
-Huh?

190
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:22,334
-What?

191
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:23,501
What is it?

192
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:26,534
-You need to come to
Lord Hokage's right away.

193
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,501
It's Naruto.

194
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,801
He stole the sacred scroll.

195
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,301
-You mean the scroll of sealing?

196
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:32,868
No!

197
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,668
-Let's see.

198
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:41,301
The first one is
multi-shadow clone jutsu.

199
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,268
Ugh, not this again!

200
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,201
It's my worst jutsu!

201
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:48,068
-Lord Hokage, this
is not just a prank!

202
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,301
This is a serious crime!

203
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:51,101
-That scroll
contains secrets that

204
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,001
were sealed by the First Hokage!

205
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:55,301
Secrets known only
to our village!

206
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,834
-If it falls into
the wrong hands,

207
00:09:56,868 --> 00:10:01,134
they could destroy our
entire way of life.

208
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,068
-All right.

209
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,701
Bring Naruto here at once.

210
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:04,301
-Sir!

211
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,601
-Where would he go?

212
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:27,434
-Now that I've told
everyone what Naruto did,

213
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,634
I can eliminate him.

214
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,468
They'll be glad he's gone.

215
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:33,268
And of course, I keep
the scroll for myself.

216
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:47,564
-[panting]

217
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,179
-It's all over.

218
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:55,112
-[laughing]

219
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,412
-Huh?

220
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,512
-Got me already.

221
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:58,546
Not bad.

222
00:10:58,579 --> 00:10:59,779
You're quick, sensei.

223
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,946
I only had time to
learn one technique.

224
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:03,946
-He's been out here practicing.

225
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,712
I can tell how hard
he's been working.

226
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,012
-Listen, Iruka-sensei.

227
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,712
I'm going to show you
this amazing jutsu,

228
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,112
and you're going
to let me graduate.

229
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,546
Then everything will be OK!

230
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,946
That's the way it works, right?

231
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,346
Anyone who learns a jutsu
from this scroll passes!

232
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,112
-Huh?

233
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,712
Where'd you get that idea?

234
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,812
-Mizuki-sensei told me about it.

235
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,246
Believe it!

236
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,079
He told me where to find
the scroll, and this place.

237
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,179
-Huh?

238
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,146
Mizuki?

239
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:29,646
Huh?

240
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,546
Look out!

241
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,779
-I see you found
our little hideaway.

242
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:38,512
-So that's the way it is, huh?

243
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,512
I should've known.

244
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,279
-Naruto!

245
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,446
Give me the scroll, now!

246
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,346
-Wait a minute.

247
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,779
What's going on here?

248
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,912
-Naruto, don't let
Mizuki get the scroll!

249
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:56,746
It contains forbidden
jutsu that could

250
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,112
put this village
in great danger.

251
00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:01,279
Mizuki used you to get
the scroll for himself,

252
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,212
for his own power!

253
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:08,246
-Naruto, Iruka's just
trying to scare you

254
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,412
because he doesn't want
you to have the scroll.

255
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:15,112
-Stop lying, Mizuki!

256
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,112
Don't let him trick you, Naruto!

257
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:20,846
--[laughing] Oh, I'll tell
you who's really lying,

258
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,246
-No, Mizuki!

259
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,812
-They've been lying to you
your whole life, Naruto,

260
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,512
since the decree 12 years ago.

261
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,846
-What decree?

262
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,412
-Everyone knows except you.

263
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,912
Iruka's trying to hide
it from you even now.

264
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,846
He'd do anything to shut me up.

265
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,079
-What is this decree?

266
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:40,279
Why does everyone
else know about it?

267
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,346
-Don't tell him!

268
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,279
It's forbidden!

269
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,012
-The decree is no
one can tell you

270
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:48,412
the nine tailed
fox is inside you.

271
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,279
The fox spirit that
killed Iruka's parents

272
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,746
and destroyed our village
has taken over your body.

273
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,746
You are the nine tailed fox.

274
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,279
-Stop it!

275
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,912
-They've all been sneaking
around hiding things from you

276
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,379
your whole life.

277
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,946
Didn't you think it was
strange how they treated you?

278
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,646
Like dirt, like they hated
you for just being alive!

279
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,212
-No!

280
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,479
No, no, no, no!

281
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,479
-Naruto!

282
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,679
-That's why you will never
be accepted in this village.

283
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,512
Even your beloved
sensei hates your guts!

284
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,379
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Iruka,
Naruto never had a mother

285
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,379
a father to care for him.

286
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:29,012
He's shut out of everything
and doesn't know why.

287
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:31,212
Most people won't
even look at him.

288
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,979
How would you feel if
everywhere you went,

289
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,512
people turned
their backs on you?

290
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,046
That's why he gets in trouble.

291
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,012
So people will notice him.

292
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,679
It may not show, but
he's always thinking

293
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:45,012
about the family
he doesn't have.

294
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,412
He's hurting inside.

295
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:48,379
-Die, Naruto!

296
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,612
-Naruto, get down!

297
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,879
-[groan]

298
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,246
-Why?

299
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,946
-Because we're the same.

300
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,812
When I lost my parents,
no one seemed to care.

301
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,912
They didn't have time for me.

302
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:21,212
They just forgot I was there.

303
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,346
My grades dropped.

304
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,812
I became the class clown.

305
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:29,979
I just wanted them to see
me and to know my name.

306
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:33,812
My schoolwork wasn't good
enough to get their attention,

307
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,046
so I did crazy things.

308
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,112
And then I had to pay for it.

309
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,946
It was hard.

310
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,546
I know that's how
you feel, Naruto.

311
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,212
You feel lonely and
it hurts inside,

312
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:52,412
and I could have been
there for you more.

313
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:53,579
I let you down.

314
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,812
I'm sorry.

315
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:57,646
No one should have
to suffer that much.

316
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,512
No one should be
alone like that.

317
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:05,346
-[laughing] Don't make me laugh!

318
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,212
Iruka always hated you!

319
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:11,046
He was orphaned because the nine
tailed fox killed his parents,

320
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,812
and that beast is
now inside you!

321
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:17,712
He'd say anything to
get the scroll from you.

322
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:20,579
-Naruto!

323
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,779
Naruto!

324
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:26,379
--[laughing] You know,
once he makes up his mind,

325
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,012
nothing can change it.

326
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:32,979
He's going to use the scroll
to take revenge on the village.

327
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,612
You saw that look in
his eye, didn't you?

328
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:39,179
Those are the eyes of a beast.

329
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:39,579
-No.

330
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,446
Naruto isn't like that!

331
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,312
-You're a joke.

332
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:52,546
As soon as I eliminate
Naruto and get the scroll,

333
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,846
I'll be back for you.

334
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,846
-[groaning] I won't let you.

335
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,546
-This is not good.

336
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,879
Mizuki has a big mouth.

337
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:10,612
He made Naruto feel so bad.

338
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:12,246
Worse than he's ever felt.

339
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,746
It could unleash the
power inside of him.

340
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,879
If Naruto keeps tampering
with the scroll,

341
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,379
the seal that locks the
fox spirit inside of him

342
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,912
could be broken, and the
beast could come out.

343
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:29,012
If that happens,
I fear for us all.

344
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:34,612
-Naruto, everything
Mizuki said was a lie!

345
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:35,579
Give me the scroll!

346
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:37,379
Hurry!

347
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:40,312
He's coming after
you to take it away!

348
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,279
[groan]

349
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,446
-It can't be.

350
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,412
How did you know?

351
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:08,946
Naruto, how did you know?

352
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:11,246
That it was me, and not Iruka?

353
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,612
-[laughing]

354
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:18,579
-Because I'm Iruka.

355
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,579
-You're a fool.

356
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:22,779
Why are you
protecting that freak?

357
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:25,479
He's the one that
wiped out your family.

358
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,979
-I don't care what you say.

359
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,679
You're not getting your
hands on that scroll.

360
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,546
-As if you could stop me.

361
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,779
Don't you get it?

362
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:34,612
Naruto is just like me.

363
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,312
-How's that?

364
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,412
-He wants the school for his
own power and his own vengeance.

365
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,146
That's how beasts are.

366
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,546
He'll pour all his rage into the
scroll and destroy everything.

367
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,046
-You're right.

368
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,212
-[gasp]

369
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:52,946
So it's true.

370
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,646
Iruka-sensei never
believed in me.

371
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,012
He thinks I'm some beast!

372
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,379
Some kind of freak!

373
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,146
-That is how beasts are.

374
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,646
But that's not who Naruto is.

375
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,279
He's nothing like that.

376
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,612
Naruto is one of a
kind, works hard,

377
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,179
puts his whole heart into it.

378
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:15,912
Sure, he messes up sometimes,
and everyone jumps on him.

379
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,346
But his suffering only
makes him stronger.

380
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:21,579
That's what separates
him from being a beast.

381
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:22,812
So you're wrong.

382
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:24,979
He's nothing like
the nine tailed fox.

383
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:29,379
He's Naruto Uzumaki of the
Village Hidden in the Leaves.

384
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:35,779
-Hmph!

385
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,079
You really believe that drivel?

386
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:39,579
Iruka, I was going to
save you for later,

387
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:40,846
but I changed my mind.

388
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,846
You're finished!

389
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,612

-Not bad, for a little punk.

-If you ever lay a hand on
my sensei, I'll kill you!

-Such big words.

395
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,412
I can completely destroy
you with a single move.

396
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:11,946
-Take your best shot, fool.

397
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,679
I'll give it back to
you a thousand fold!

-Let's see you try!

Show me what you can
do, nine tailed fox!

He's amazing.

He wants to surpass
all the Hokage.

And I'm starting to
believe he might do it.

This is only the beginning.

The road gets tougher
now that you're a ninja.

guess it would ruin the moment,
