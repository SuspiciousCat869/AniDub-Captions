00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:58,494
-Any sign of Naruto?

3
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,930
-I looked, but I can't find him.

4
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:03,366
-I see.

5
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,601
-He must be pretty
far away by now.

6
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,338
Either he drifted
away or swam off.

7
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:14,610
Anyway, with the fog
as thick as it is,

8
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,713
there's no reason to stick
around and keep looking.

9
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,885
Let's find the closest shoreline
and start again when it clears.

10
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,486
-Fine.

11
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:47,076
-It's been far too
long, Lord Orochimaru.

12
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,978
-Indeed it has.

13
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:51,948
How fortunate that I
dropped by and happened

14
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,584
to find you still here.

15
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:55,852
-I'm lucky.

16
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,421
For now I have the opportunity
to stand in your presence

17
00:02:58,454 --> 00:02:59,756
once again.

18
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,960
--[laughs] And I assume the
reason you remain here is that

19
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,062
you are continuing our research.

20
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,530
-I am.

21
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,066
I still believe that someday
it will be very useful to you,

sir.

23
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,469
-I certainly hope so.

24
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:18,007
-Of course, I only continue
out of loyalty to you.

25
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,842
-Well, carry on.

26

Do as you wish.

-I'm grateful, my lord.

By the way, is he the
one you spoke of before?

29
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,418
-Yes.

30
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,754
The younger brother
of Itachi Uchiha.

00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,322

-Yes.

better left unsaid.

-Hey.

00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,973
You don't think-- I mean,
Naruto's still OK, right?

40
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:00,510
-He wouldn't be
beaten so easily.

41
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,012
After all, he is a Leaf ninja.

financial administrator.

Welcome.

44
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,788
My name is Hitode.

45
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:14,991
I am well aware
of the situation.

46
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,526
Your colleague is
missing and I'm

47
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,661
sure you're very
worried about him.

48
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,929
-Yes.

49
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:22,598
Have you gotten any information
at all about where he is?

50
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,334
-Unfortunately, I have
received no reports yet

51
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,370
from any shipwreck survivors.

52
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:28,905
-I see.

53
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:32,909
-That's not all the bad news.

54
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:35,711
I'm sorry, but the schedule for
our ship delivering the money

55
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,513
has been moved up.

56

-You're leaving earlier?

57
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:43,719
-Our new departure is
scheduled for tomorrow morning.

58
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,522
My apologies for
such a late notice.

59
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,357
As you can imagine,
the relationship

60
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,359
with the Land of
Water is fragile.

61
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:55,064
Hence the decision was made
to push our departure forward.

62
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,899
-We understand.

63
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,902
Even so, we need to spend as
much time here as possible,

64
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,637
trying to find our teammate.

65
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,339
-Of course.

66
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,607
-Good.

67
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,609
Then we'll meet your ship
tomorrow at the port guard duty

68
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,011
with or without him.

69
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:12,615
-Thank you for your cooperation.

70
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,984
One more thing.

71
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:19,488
As you can see, our nation
is not a wealthy one,

72
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,324
and recently the
fisherman of our land

73
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,994
have been especially nervous
about this demon of the ocean.

74
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:28,564
Anything you could do would
be greatly appreciated.

75

-Uh, yeah.

80
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,464
-Hey, you're that
girl from yesterday.

81
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:02,865
I remember.

82
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,000
You're the one who saved me.

Thanks a million.

84
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,903
-It was just a coincidence.

85

-No way.

86
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,540
You seriously saved
my butt out there.

-So what were you doing
in such a remote area?

95
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,460
-Oh, I had a mission.

96
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,529
To get rid of the demon
of the ocean that's

97
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,798
been causing so much trouble.

98
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,401
-Then it would be best
for you to give up.

99
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:41,504
If you're able to find the
beast, you'll never survive.

100
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:43,439
-You don't need
to worry about me.

101
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:45,641
Yeah, I've had tough
missions before.

102
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,343
I was a little
careless yesterday,

103
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,945
but next time I'll catch
that demon of the-- yikes!

104
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:50,913
That's hot!

105
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:54,717
-So, you feeling a
little better now?

106
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:55,918
-Yeah.

107
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,787
Thanks to you and this awesome
food, I'm feeling fine.

108
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,954
-Very well then.

109
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:00,656
When you're finished with
your meal, please leave.

110
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,139
-What?

111
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:04,809
Huh?

112
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:18,007
Hold on, Isaribi.

113
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:18,974
Slow down.

114
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,410
What gives?

115
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:22,078
What?

116
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:22,878
What the?

117
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,950
Who did this?

118
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,052
-Some children from
the village did it.

119
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:32,755
But I can't let it bother me.

120
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:33,723
-Wait, Isaribi.

121
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,927
Remember I owe you one.

-Look, it's the monster.

123
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,905
-What monster?

124
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:50,806
-Get out of here.

125
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,807
-You're a bad omen.

126
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,677
-Yeah, take this.

127
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,911
-Isaribi!

128
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:56,946
Leave her alone!

129
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:57,847
-She won't talk.

130
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:58,447
-Look at her.

131
00:08:58,481 --> 00:08:58,981
-Say something.

132
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:09,558
-Knock it off, you twerps.

133
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,695
I'm not going to let you take
your stupid pranks too far.

134
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:13,696
-Yeah, and who are you?

135
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,031
A friend of the monster?

136
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:16,932
-The monster?

137
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,467
-Everybody knows it's true.

138
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:21,437
-Yeah, Isaribi secretly
went up and joined up

139
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,806
with the demon of the ocean.

140
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,708
-You shouldn't make
up things like that.

141
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,009
-It's the truth.

-Hey, who are you
calling a doofus?

-Let them go.

-What?

147
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:35,518
But they--

148
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:37,453
-It's all right.

149
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,455
You should just leave me alone.

150
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:40,322
-Leave you alone?

151
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:41,090
No way.

152
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:43,058
If those kids keep
doing that all--

153
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:43,993
-Don't you get it?

154
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:47,463
It's none of your business!

155
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:48,330
They're right.

156

I was taken away by the spirits.

157

It's only natural people
think I'm strange.

158
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:55,738
-But that wasn't your fault.

159
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:58,474
It's not like you want
to be taken or anything.

160
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,109
-That doesn't matter.

161
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:02,611
The truth is most
humans would never

162
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,648
associate with someone
as different is I am.

-Yeah.

We thought that if a boat
left port last night,

00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,760
someone here probably
would have seen something.

169
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:54,930
-I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can be of any help to you.

170
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,866
Lately the villages
have been staying away

171
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,667
from the port at night
because they're all

172
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,069
scared of the demon.

173
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,003
-Oh, I see.

174
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,640
-He's been taken by the spirits.

175
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,442
I'm afraid the
demon of the ocean

176
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:07,843
has taken yet another victim.

177
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:08,711
-Mother.

178
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,479
Don't frighten them like that.

179
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,314
-Taken by the--

180
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,483
-I heard that
phrase at the port.

181
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:15,851
This taken by the spirits.

182
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:17,887
Can you tell us
what you know of it?

183
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,421
-I can, but what
good will it do?

184
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:20,890
Talking won't bring
your friend back.

185
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,324
-But still--

186
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:24,326
-Please, you must forgive us.

187
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:27,363
This subject isn't something
we can discuss with outsiders.

188
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,665
-We might be able to
help your village.

189
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:30,833
Don't you see?

190
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,102
We came here to get rid
of the demon of the ocean.

191
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:36,338
-You came to do what?

192
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:38,974
All right then.

193
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:41,877
For as long as I've known,
generations of fishermen

194
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,313
have told the legend
of Demon Island.

195
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:46,382
-A legend?

196
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,683
-Yes.

197
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,419
The legend warns against even
going near the isolated place

198
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,721
they call the Island of Demons.

199
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,324
From the beginning the
waters off Demon Island

200
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:56,659
were rich in fish.

201
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,795
But the hidden reefs there made
it too dangerous for boats.

202
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:03,732
Most people headed the
legend and stayed away.

203
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:07,536
But one unusually cool
summer 10 years ago, the fish

204
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,638
disappeared from the sea.

205
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:11,941
We had no choice,
so my husband and I

206
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:13,742
ventured into the
treacherous waters.

207
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,682
We caught many fish.

208
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:22,017
But when I returned to
the surface with our haul,

209
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,686
I was stunned.

210
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,987
The boat was empty.

211
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,723
My husband was
nowhere to be seen.

212
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:31,660
Since then, one by one, everyone
who approaches that island

213
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,662
has disappeared.

214
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:36,432
Even those who go to
search for the missing.

215
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,734
No one will go near
the island for fear

216
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,604
that they too will
be taken away.

217
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,039
-An island where
people disappear?

218
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:46,108
-It's such a bizarre story.

219
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,343
-Wait a second.

220
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,711
We heard something
about a girl who

221
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:50,846
returned from being taken away.

222
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,314
-Oh, yes.

223
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:53,048
Isaribi.

224
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:55,484
-Ma'am, I have
one more question.

225
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,319
I want you to tell
me where she lives.

226
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,631
-Lady Tsunade.

227
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:09,632
Lady Tsunade.

228
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:15,155
I brought you that
information you requested.

229
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:18,224
Is that about the
Land of the Sea?

230
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,126
So you are worried after all.

231
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,266
-You see, when Orochimaru
abandoned Anko,

232
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,201
she was found in
the land of the sea.

233
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:37,410
[panting]

234
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:43,283
-Hey.

235
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:44,317
Are you OK?

236
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,123
-It's no use.

237
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:52,492
I don't remember anything.

238
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,795
I should know this, but
everything-- it was dark,

239
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,397
empty.

240
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,732
My body was in so much pain.

241
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,534
I can't.

242
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:02,802
-Just calm down.

243
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,838
Take as much time as
you need to think.

244
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:09,676
-I'm not even sure if I got this
weird mark while I was there.

245
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,244
-The damage is deep.

246
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:12,812
Everything she knew
may have been erased.

247
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,157
-Rest easy.

248
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,226
I know you must have been
through quite an ordeal.

249
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,731
It's going to be fine.

250
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:33,399
Don't worry about remembering.

251
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,468
Our priority is
treating the curse mark

252
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:36,870
before it gets worse.

253
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:39,873
-Lord Hokage.

254
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,474
I--

255
00:14:41,508 --> 00:14:44,410
-She never did
remember anything.

256
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:48,548
Even to this day, part of
Anko's memory is simply gone.

257
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:51,885
-So that's what happened.

258
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:53,486
And this mission
is the first time

259
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,588
Anko has set foot in
the land of the sea

260
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:57,757
since she went
through all of that?

261
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,791
-Yep.

262
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:01,628
That's right.

263
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,730
I had hoped this
trip might bring back

264
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,398
some of her lost memories, but--

265
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,137
-What?

266
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,540
I just missed them?

267
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,675
You're telling me they
came right through here?

268
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,809
-Yeah.

269
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,545
If you hurry, you might
be able to catch them.

270
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:19,279
-OK.

271
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:20,413
Which way did they go?

272
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:23,449
-Off that way.

273
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:28,254
-No way, that's the
direction I just came from!

274
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,522
They better still be there.

275
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,340
-The delivery ship is en route.

276
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,344
-Interesting.

277
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,479
So she's the only person
who ever came back

278
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:54,581
after disappearing?

279
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:55,815
-Yeah.

280
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:58,284
That's why I figured we should
at least go check it out.

281
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:00,587
-She may have some useful
information about Demon Island.

282
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:03,713
-Hold it.

283
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:12,398
-What?

284
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:13,800
It's her.

285
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,835
What do we do now?

286
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,403
-Let's find out
where she's headed.

287
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,778
-She's cautious.

288
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:26,713
-Let's follow.

289
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,314
But make sure she
doesn't see us.

290
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:43,796
-Hey!

291
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,531
Where'd you go?

292
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,499
Aw, great.

293
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:49,152
If I keep going
backwards like this

294
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,853
I'm going to end up
at Isaribi's house.

295
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,413
-Look at those features.

296
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:21,784
So you must be the
demon of the ocean.

297
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:22,267
Ah!

298
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,726
-What the?

299
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,467
-It's getting away.

300
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,352
-But Lord Orochimaru--

301
00:17:56,386 --> 00:18:00,056
-I'm going to teach you
something very special today.

302
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:03,826
This is one of the secret
chambers where I develop jutsu.

303
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,297
I was hoping you would help me
with this specimen, my dear.

304
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,000
-But if the villagers
knew about this.

305
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:14,737
-This one is going quite
as smoothly as I planned.

306
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,939
Only more step and she's done.

307
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:19,142
Don't be silly, little one.

308
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:22,111
There's nothing you
should be afraid of.

309
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:24,714
There's only one thing
we ever need fear,

310
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:27,083
and that's neglecting
our duty to pursue

311
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:28,051
this kind of knowledge.

312
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:35,325
-Could it be the same girl?

313
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,185
-Give up.

314
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:03,953
There's no escape.

315
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:05,121
-We've got you now, demon.

316
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,693
-Hey!

317
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:11,828
Everyone!

318
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:12,310
Hey!

319
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:17,734
I've been looking all
over for you guys.

320
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:18,267
-Naruto!

321
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,102
Thank goodness.

322
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:20,336
We were worried about you.

323
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,438
-Unfortunately you're
a bit too late.

324
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:24,474
-What are you talking about?

325
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,876
-We captured the
demon of the ocean.

326
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:29,278
Take a look for
yourself over there.

327
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:29,879
-Whoa.

328
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,984
Wow.

329
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:36,219
So that's the demon?

330
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,062
Isaribi?

331
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:46,544

You really are

-Hold on.

Isaribi, answer me!

be rough with her.

She's not strong.

We can't let her escape.

This girl's an

What the heck are you thinking?

You can't rescue

-I can't just let her go.

I owe her.

-Even if you did
go after her, you

wouldn't have any
clue where to look.
