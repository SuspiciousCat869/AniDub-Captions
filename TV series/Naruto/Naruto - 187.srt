[theme music]

2
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,288
-All the pieces are in
place and ready to go.

3
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,389
-So, brother.

4
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,359
That's the Land of
Greens you told us about?

5
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,561
-It sure doesn't
look like much, but I

6
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,497
guess it's a stepping stone
to bigger things, huh?

7
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,700
-Half the village officials
have been bought and paid for.

8
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,437
At our signal, the castle will
be overthrown from within.

9
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,240
By day's end, we'll
be feudal lords.

10
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,708
How do you like
the sound of that?

11
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,411
-Feudal lords?

12
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,612
-I like it fine.

13
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,689
TSUNADE: No matter
what combination

14
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,258
I try, the problem
still remains.

15
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,260
Of the ninja that
I have available,

16
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,095
there's no one to take the lead.

17
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,198
-Well, it's only escort duty
for caravan of merchants.

18
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,667
I'm sure they'll be
able to handle it,

19
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,468
no matter who you
end up sending.

20
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,303
-It's not the difficulty
of the mission.

21
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,206
I'm worried about it's
impressing the client.

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,510
The Land of Greens hired us
for this one, and you see,

23
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,480
the lord of that land
was very good to me once.

24
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,049
-I remember.

25
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,584
He paid off that gigantic
gambling debt of yours.

26
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,254
I'm not really sure he
was doing you a favor.

27
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,724
-It's just a little place,
but so lovely and peaceful.

28
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,093
I remember a charming
little princess

29
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:17,097
with two handsome young ninja
bodyguards looking after her.

30
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,399
Foolish boys, always
fighting over me.

31
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,702
Both of them were
dying to marry me.

32
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,004
I wonder if they
still feel the same.

33
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,972
-I wouldn't hold your breath.

34
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,175
-They must be all
grown up by now.

35
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,020
-We'll cross the border soon.

36
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,455
-Take a last look.

37
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,255
It'll be a while.

38
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,729
-Finally!

39
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,065
A real mission!

40
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,066
-Please, Naruto.

41
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,701
Not so fast!

42
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,170
-All this time, I've just
been stuck doing stupid chores

43
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,039
around the village
while everybody else get

44
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,574
to go on missions.

45
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,577
I'm so sick of having to listen
to other peoples adventures.

46
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,113
-Well, I wouldn't
get too excited.

47
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,282
It's only basic escort duty
for some traveling merchants.

48
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,584
-It's OK.

49
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,320
We'll just make up something
like we ran into 1,000 bandits.

50
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,589
Don't worry, we'll have a
story to tell when we get back.

51
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,591
-So he can brag about it.

52
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,597
-There.

53
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,599
It's the guys we're looking for.

54
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,199
Hey!

55
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,733
Hold on!

56
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,306
-Who are you?

57
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,475
We're here to help,
if you're the caravan

58
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,444
from the Land of
Greens, that is.

59
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,712
-Yes we are.

60
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,180
-Well that's perfect.

61
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,083
Me and my buddies here have
been sent to be your escort.

62
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,718
-From where?

63
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,286
-Check it out.

64
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,554
Hidden Leaf village.

65
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,390
-We're here to help out, in
case you run into some bandits.

66
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,463
-Then it's true.

67
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,133
-I'm Naruto Uzumaki, and
this is my friend, Hinata.

68
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,701
-I'm Choji Akimichi.

69
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:05,071
-Oh, and our, uh, Hokage
gave us one more piece

70
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,175
of identification so you can be
absolutely sure we are who we

71
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:08,608
s--

72
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,414
-What are you doing, Momiji?

73
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,316
Give that back.

74
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,250
-It's true.

75
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,252
They must be who
they say they are.

76
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,221
Look what this says!

77
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,591
Leaf Village Moving Service!

78
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,327
-What the heck is that?

79
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,562
-That grandma.

80
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,596
She's full of surprises.

81
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,368
-Well, in that case,
my name's Kikusuke,

82
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:39,272
and this is Yorinoshin,
and this is Shun.

83
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,574
-And I'm Momiji.

84
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,508
We need more pushers.

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,176
I'm glad you've come!

86
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,144
-More what?

87
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,390
-You eat a lot, don't you?

88
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:02,128
I guess that explains why you're
so fa-- --bulously strong!

89
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:02,529
-Hm.

90
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,130
Want some?

91
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,599
-I admire people who
are really strong.

92
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,500
-Aw, this is nothing, kid.

93
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,569
I've hardly even broken a sweat.

94
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,570
Hang on!

95
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,077
-Look at that show off.

96
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,412
He's gonna be sorry.

97
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,148
-Let's talk and
more effort, you.

98
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,683
We're falling behind schedule.

99
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,586
-Being pack animals isn't
usually part of our job.

100
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,988
And anyway.

101
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,990
How come you're the only one
who doesn't have to push?

102
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,692
-He, uh-- He can't.

103
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,595
Our poor cousin Shun is
not very well, you see?

104
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,763
-Oh.

105
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,099
-Oh, don't worry, cousins.

106
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,434
Nothing he says
could ever offend me.

107
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,169
Good for nothing
weaklings like that boy

108
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,671
are always finding excuses.

109
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,007
-Good for nothing weakling, huh?

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,275
Well eat my dust, mister!

111
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,251
-I think you guys may have
pushed yourselves too hard.

112
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,987
-I apologize for Shun's
rudeness back there.

113
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,454
Here.

114
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,656
Have some water.

115
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,256
Huh?

116
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,594
-Mine is empty too.

117
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,062
Are we all out?

118
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:09,562
-Nope.

119
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,363
Here's some more.

120
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,299
Cold and fresh.

121
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,066
Catch!

122
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,200
-Thanks!

123
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,569
Hey, how'd you find water
in a place like this?

124
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,539
-My grandma taught
me a trick she knows!

125
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,374
-Grandma?

126
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,376
-I'll show you.

127
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,477
You use these.

128
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,445
NARUTO: Huh?

129
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,713
But how?

130
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,715
-It's called dousing.

131
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,252
You just concentrate hard
on what you're looking for,

132
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,455
and they react when you're
getting close to it.

133
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,091
It's a trick we learned
from our ancestor.

134
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,359
-Whoa.

135
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,660
I could use something like that.

136
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,363
I lost some money the other day
and it's been driving me crazy.

137
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,446
-Not as sweet as the
water in the Land

138
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,982
of Greens, but it's water.

139
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,218
-What kind of place is the
land of Greens, anyway?

140
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,187
MAN: It's a small place.

141
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,289
It lies sheltered deep
within the mountains.

142
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,325
Its people live in perfect
harmony with each other

143
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,194
in with the world around them.

144
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,130
It was almost like
a paradise on Earth.

145
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,064
-Was like?

146
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,366
MAN: Oh, I mean--

147
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,333
-What gives?

148
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,434
How come if it's
such a great place

149
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,336
they have to hire
protection from outsiders?

150
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,241
-By taking peace
for granted, they

151
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,477
guaranteed it wouldn't last.

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,077
-Huh?

153
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,116
-OK, what's that
supposed to mean?

154
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,450
-Living in peace
and harmony might

155
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,386
sound like a beautiful
thing, but the people

156
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,321
of the Land of Greens
have been living that way

157
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,257
so long that they've
become soft and unprepared.

158
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,092
In times like these,
you'd have to be blind

159
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,095
or a fool not to expect
the worst of others.

160
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,063
-Now, now.

161
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,364
They've done nothing
to do deserve

162
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,700
such disrespectful talk.

163
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,436
Are you forgetting how kind
and hospitable the Lord

164
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,971
of the Land of Greens was?

165
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,473
And we were just passing
through his village.

166
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,074
-Ha.

167
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,746
-He didn't even listen
to the old lady.

168
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,182
That guy's got a serious
attitude problem.

169
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,750
Hey, he's your cousin, right?

170
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,286
Can't you do
something about him?

171
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,588
-Uh, well--

172
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,591
-He's had some tough
times recently.

173
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,527
-Oh, uh, OK.

174
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:26,566
-Hey!

175
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,600
Careful up there!

176
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,171
Watch your step!

177
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,472
Don't get near the edge!

178
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,007
-Look, Choji.

179
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,741
What's what?

180
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,612
-Naruto!

181
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,413
I

182
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,714
-What's going on?

183
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,549
-Look at that.

184
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,084
-Whoa, smoke.

185
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,586
-That's right where the
Land of Greens is, isn't it?

186
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,088
-I don't like the look of that.

187
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,557
I'm gonna get on over there
and find out what's up.

188
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,058
You guys go ahead.

189
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,064
-Hey.

190
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,599
We don't want everyone else in
the caravan getting worried,

191
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,168
so let's just keep this to
ourselves for right now, OK?

192
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,536
-Right, Our secret.

193
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,310
-Choji, where's Naruto?

194
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,444
-Um, the bathroom.

195
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,671
-I'll let you have
them if you tell me

196
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,373
what it was you saw back there.

197
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,111
-We saw smoke rising.

198
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,513
Lots of black smoke.

199
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,181
-Black smoke rising?

200
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,216
Which direction?

201
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,520
-From the Land of Greens.

202
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,287
-My lord.

203
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,588
Shun, it's finally come.

204
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,363
-According to this,
I'll cross the border

205
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,398
of the Land of Greens
right afte-- Ah!

206
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:12,572
Man.

207
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,107
Where'd that come from?

208
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,542
There was no one
around a minute ago.

209
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,684
Who's there?

210
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,119
What's the big idea?

211
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,130
Who's there?

212
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,765
What's the big idea?

213
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,400
MAN: From the looks
of your headband,

214
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,202
you must be one of
the Hidden Leaf.

215
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,069
-So what?

216
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,370
It's a headband, not a target!

217
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,240
What are you attacking
me for, anyway?

218
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,475
Far as I know, I don't
have a gripe against you,

219
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,743
whoever you are!

220
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,479
MAN: The ones we're after
are headed in this direction.

221
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,748
You just happened
to get in the way,

222
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,018
and anyone who gets
in our way dies!

223
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,495
Got him.

224
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,364
-Substitution jutsu.

225
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,366
-Hey, I'm up here!

226
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:39,626
Man, these two jokers
are pretty good.

227
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,363
-Only two left, so one of
them must be the real one.

228
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,437
What?

229
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,144
-Too bad!

230
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,345
You came so close!

231
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,080
You were only off by one.

232
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,515
Well, so much for them.

233
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,417
I've got to get
back to the others.

234
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,360
Choji, Hinata!

235
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,095
-Well, what did you find out?

236
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,463
-In a word, trouble.

237
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,332
Listen up, everybody.

238
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,234
Let's take a little break, OK?

239
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,068
-What?

240
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,069
-What is he talking about?

241
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,277
-So they were from
the Land of Greends?

242
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,079
-They said that the
ones they were after

243
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,614
were headed in this direction.

244
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,715
-But why?

245
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,184
Why would ninjas want
to attack this group?

246
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,153
It's just a caravan of
traveling merchants.

247
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,487
They're harmless.

248
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,124
And according to them, the Land
of Greens treated them kindly.

249
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,626
-Yeah, well who knows?

250
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,127
Don't look at me.

251
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,429
-So what do we do?

252
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,230
-I say we take them
on, if they're really

253
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,366
dumb enough to
try and attack us.

254
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,168
-That could be dangerous.

255
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,437
What about the chlildren,
and the old ones?

256
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,305
-I forgot about them.

257
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,373
-Hold on.

258
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,108
Why go out of our way
looking for trouble when

259
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,444
it'd be a whole lot
easier to go around it?

260
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,612
-What the heck's that
supposed to mean?

261
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,214
-You ever stop and think?

262
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,350
Maybe we just happen to
be taking the same route

263
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,684
as their real target.

264
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,754
Maybe we're not even the ones
these guys are after, you know?

265
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,323
-Yeah, you're right.

266
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,659
So if we just get off this
road and take a different once,

267
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,128
maybe we can just avoid the
whole problem all together!

268
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,096
Yes!

269
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:23,996
OK, everyone!

270
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,997
Change of plans!

271
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,200
We're gonna take
another route to avoid

272
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,068
some really vicious
ninja up ahead!

273
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,303
-Some vicious ninja?

274
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,505
-I don't think I would've
put it like that, Naruto.

275
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,474
Now you've got everyone nervous.

276
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,542
-You think?

277
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,477
-Don't worry!

278
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,479
It's not us they're after.

279
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,581
Nevertheless, we think
it would probably best

280
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,349
to try to avoid them.

281
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,385
So we'll take the trail
that cuts off to the side

282
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,352
just ahead.

283
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,620
It may be a little
out of our way,

284
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,688
but better safe than sorry.

285
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,231
-Is that really all
the treasure there is?

286
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,366
What kind of a
feudal lord is this?

287
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,170
-Unfortunately, one too honest
to line his own pockets.

288
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,373
But of course, that all
changes starting right now.

289
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,277
More importantly, has there
been any sign of the young lady?

290
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,381
-Not yet, but those two we sent
out to find her were attacked.

291
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,017
Now at least we know
which way she's headed.

292
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,253
-Just getting the
girl's not enough.

293
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,422
If any of the others
get away, they

294
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,223
might get a hold
of reinforcements

295
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,059
from another land and come back.

296
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,228
If only the sun were
a little stronger,

297
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,064
I could have burned down this
whole mountain with my jutsu.

298
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,302
-Heh, heh, heh.

299
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,403
Leave it to me.

300
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,345
-Excuse me, Lord Renga.

301
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,514
All the local people who
have sworn allegiance to you

302
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,349
have gathered in the main hall.

303
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,083
-Good.

304
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,652
We're very grateful.

305
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,221
Without the help of
turncoats such as yourself,

306
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,723
we never could have carried the
castle's defenses so easily.

307
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,328
-Well, brother, what do you say?

308
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,530
Should we go to the hall and
greet our new supporters?

309
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,398
-Go on.

310
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,766
I'll take care of things here.

311
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,142
-Now, as to the
reward you promised.

312
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:16,742
-Ah, yes.

313
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,510
Your reward.

314
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,511
Of course.

315
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,979
Go on and help yourself.

316
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,447
Take as much as you like.

317
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,682
-You're so generous, my lord!

318
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,156
-Isn't it funny
how some people are

319
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,358
so gullible and easy to deceive?

320
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,360
-You can say that
again, o wise one.

321
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,631
Our lord was such a fool that
he trusted us to the very end.

322
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,466
-Don't stuff too
much in your pockets,

323
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,468
or you might sink the
ferry carrying you

324
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,538
across the river of oblision.

325
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,006
-Huh?

326
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,207
-You're quite right.

327
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,177
Only a fool would
trust the likes of you.

328
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,680
A fat, greedy weasel who has
already betrayed one master.

329
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,216
-You-- you're
joking, Lord Renga.

330
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,520
No I'm afraid it's no joke.

331
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,022
[shouting]

332
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,093
-So you had me gather all the
others together just so you

333
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:07,493
could--

334
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,301
-You wanted your reward?

335
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,103
Well, then here it is.

336
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,080
-There, that should do it.

337
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,228
-There can no
longer be any doubt.

338
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,063
They're definitely
coming after us.

339
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,097
-Yes.

340
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,465
-Stay with Lady Haruna.

341
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,300
-Why?

342
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,467
What are you're going to do?

343
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,236
-We can't wait for
them to attack.

344
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,438
There's too many in
the caravan to defend.

345
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,073
If I can find them
first, there's

346
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,341
a chance I can divert them.

347
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,342
Slow them down.

348
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,411
But see, there's three of them.

349
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,314
Rogue ninja with
unknown powerful jutsu.

350
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,350
-I know what they say, but
I'm confident my jutsu will

351
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,352
be more than a match for theirs.

352
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,320
-Very well, then.

353
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,622
Good luck, Hikunojo.

354
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,257
-Thank you, Lady Haruna.

355
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,065
-It's all right.

356
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,300
I've set traps for anyone
who could be following us.

357
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,003
-Yu're always such a
worry wart, Hinata.

358
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,005
I'm sure we won't need need 'em.

359
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,141
-Say, where's Kikusuke?

360
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,076
-Hey, yeah.

361
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,177
What happened to him?

362
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,613
-Oh, uh, there was
something he needed to do.

363
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,580
He'll be back.

364
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,248
-He can't do that.

365
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,683
Just run off and
leave the caravan

366
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,453
any time he wants to-- oh.

367
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,654
I get it.

368
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,590
Something he needed to do.

369
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,691
-What is it?

370
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,493
-Let's just say he had
to take a little break

371
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,495
to go water a tree.

372
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,096
-Naruto.

373
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,168
-I will protect Lady Haruna
with my life if need be.

374
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:00,473
There you are.

375
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,082
So who are you?

376
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,450
-I'm called Ruiga.

377
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,320
How very bold of you to
come face us on your own.

378
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,321
That clinches it.

379
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,456
She's in that
caravan, isn't she?

380
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,091
-I don't know where
your friends are,

381
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,494
but one rogue
ninja I can handle.

382
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,261
-Heh.

383
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,230
You sure about that?

384
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,499
-Witness the flower ninja
art of the Land of Greens!

385
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,080
Flower Shuriken, Flying
Flower, Falling Foliage!

386
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,557
-Nice try.

387
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,192
-I'm just getting started.

388
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,364
-Huh?

389
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,266
-Flower Ninja Art,
Release Myraid of Flowers!

390
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,206
Ninja Art, Mirror
Flower Water Moon!

391
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,209
-A bouquet of paper bombs, eh?

392
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,511
Clever, but futile.

393
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,747
And now some genjutsu, I see.

394
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,191
Hm?

395
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,530
-And now for the final blow.

396
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,532
Flower Ninja Art Bloom!

397
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,101
Myriad of Flowers!

398
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,161
-Is this were a garden
party, your flower jutsu

399
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,264
would take first prize, but
against me, it's useless.

400
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:13,172
And now it's my turn!

401
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,440
Try this.

402
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,308
Water Style, Liquid Memory.

403
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,991
[theme music]

404
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,080
NARUTO: Hm.

405
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,249
What exactly is the
Running Ramen strategy?

406
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,583
HINATA: Oh, it's
just another name

407
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,652
for splitting up,
dispersing our forces.

408
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,753
CHOJI: Right!

409
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,655
Giving our enemies more
targets to go after.

410
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,390
NARUTO: What happens
if the ramen spills

411
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,324
while we're running?

412
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,525
HINATA: It's just a metaphor.

413
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,994
NARUTO: Or what if it gets cold?

414
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,263
Maybe it should be the Running
Ramen with Protective Lid

415
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,130
strategy.

416
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,132
HINATA: Whatever
you say, Naruto.

417
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,402
CHOJI: I'm starting to think
you really don't get it, do you?

418
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,439
NARUTO: Next time, Mystery
of the Targeted Merchants!
