THEME SONG: [speaking Japanese]

2
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:00,342
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke!

3
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,344
Say what you like about Naruto.

4
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:03,346
That he's a pest.

5
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,347
That he gets in the way.

6
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,149
That he's just a kid.

7
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:09,753
But at least he's--
He's doing something.

8
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:12,356
At least, he's no coward!

9
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:12,922
Sasuke!

10
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:27,305
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Foolish little brother.

11
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:29,307
You can't kill me.

12
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,710
Your hate's not strong enough.

13
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,712
You're not strong enough.

14
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:37,316
Your life is too
precious to you.

15
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,317
So run.

16
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,053
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): No.

17
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:42,689
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

18
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:45,692
Run away and live.

19
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,328
Live with the shame.

20
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,296
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): No.

21
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,567
-No!

22
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,475
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
The Sharingan revived.

23
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:01,910
Dragon Flame Jutsu.

24
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,182
-I knew it.

25
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,618
It's finally happened.

26
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,054
His Uchiha blood
has come to a boil.

27
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,656
I think I'll play
with him a little,

28
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,926
and learn the full
extent of his powers.

29
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:21,365
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): All I cared
about was surviving, in order

30
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:23,667
to defeat my brother.

31
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,769
What a fool I've been!

32
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:28,540
I see the truth now.

33
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:29,507
Naruto.

34
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,808
Sakura.

35
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:33,311
If I haven't the courage
to face this demon,

36
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,313
how can I ever hope to face him?

37
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,004
[grunts]

38
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,728
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I can see.

39
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,562
I can see!

40
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,253
[grunts]

41
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,123
[grunts]

42
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:46,191
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
You're good.

43
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:50,095
You anticipate my attacks,
and your aim is true.

44
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,966
You can see my moves, can't you?

45
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,647
ANKO (VOICEOVER):
Sun's going down.

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,616
I gotta find him soon.

47
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,518
My odds are bad enough as it is.

48
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:13,255
They'll only get
worse in the dark.

49
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:15,290
But why now?

50
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,125
What the devil
could he be after?

51
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:21,530
No matter.

52
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:22,966
He's here.

53
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:27,036
Time to finish this.

54
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,101
[grunts]

55
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:08,149
-Substitution!

56
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:23,841
[grunts]

57
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:32,940
-Sasuke!

58
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,085
-What a disappointment
you turned out to be.

59
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,621
Your ancestors weep.

60
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:47,759
The Uchiha clan should
thank me for killing you.

61
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,295
Silly little worm!

62
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:56,883
[gasps]

63
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:10,851
-Incredible.

64
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:15,523
A Sharingan windmill
triple attack!

65
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:20,729
[grunts]

66
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,198
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Fire-Style Dragon Flame Jutsu!

67
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:35,478
[screams]

68
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:36,479
-He did it!

69
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:59,238
[gasping]

70
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,040
-Sasuke!

71
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,208
You did it!

72
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:05,411
You OK?

73
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,113
Don't worry.

74
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:07,781
It's all over.

75
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:22,196
[both gasping]

76
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,064
-No.

77
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:24,399
Impossible.

78
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,001
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Such mastery

79
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:29,071
of the Sharingan
at so young an age.

80
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:33,242
You're a true Uchiha after all.

81
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:37,681
Yes, you'll do nicely.

82
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:40,383
[screaming]

83
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,786
You are definitely his brother.

84
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:46,656
If anything, your eyes are
even keener than Itachi's.

85
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,624
-(ANGRILY) Who are you?

86
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,393
What do you want?

87
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:54,599
[chuckling]

88
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:57,435
-My name is Orochimaru.

89
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,237
But as to what I
want, that will have

90
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,206
to wait until we meet again.

91
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,942
Which won't happen until
you finish this test

92
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,412
with the best score of all.

93
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:06,946
[gasps]

94
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,147
-The scroll!

95
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,616
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
First, you'll

96
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,117
have to defeat the hidden
sound ninja who serve me.

97
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,186
-I have no idea what
you're talking about.

98
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,322
But if you're finished,
why don't you just beat it?

99
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,858
If we never meet again,
it'll be too soon.

100
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,128
-Oh, he and I will meet again.

101
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:28,937
[gasps]

102
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,405
-Sasuke, no!

103
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:34,520
[gasping]

104
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,326
-Sasuke!

105
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,160
You!

106
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:53,230
What have you done to Sasuke?

107
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,133
-I just gave him a
little parting gift.

108
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:59,304
Very soon, Sasuke
will seek me out.

109
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,606
He'll desire my power.

110
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,476
In the meantime, I
enjoyed the demonstration

111
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,113
of the powers you
already possess.

112
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:13,119

[gasping]

116
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:22,196
-What is it?

117
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,764
What's he done to you?

118
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:24,364
Are you--

119
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:34,542
It's OK.

120
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,882
[screaming]

121
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:41,750
Hang on.

122
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:42,885
You're gonna be OK.

123
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,652
[passes out]

124
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,253
Sasuke!

125
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,425
Sasuke.

126
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,162
[crying]

127
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,731
Naruto!

00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,132
Sasuke's hurt!

129
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:58,669
I need you!

130
00:10:58,702 --> 00:10:59,270
Naruto!

131

[crying]

132
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:20,693
I don't-- I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

133
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:49,993
ANKO (VOICEOVER):
I can feel him.

134
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,475
He's somewhere close.

[chuckling]

136
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:28,902
-Well, well, Anko.

137
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:31,138
It's been a while.

138
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,439
[chuckling]

139
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:34,207
-This is no time to reminisce.

140
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,909
You're an S-class criminal.

141
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,678
Top of the most wanted list.

142
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,381
You've got to be taken
down, and it's only fitting

143
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:43,952
that I'm the one to do it.

144
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:47,289
Because after all, you're the
one who taught me everything.

145
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:48,958
Right, sensei?

146
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:49,759
-Not quite.

Come out of there!

Now then.

157
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:43,384
Let me just borrow
your left hand.

158
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,120
-That hand sign.

It's over.

162
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:49,925
You and I are going to die here.

-That's right.

173
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,471
OROCHIMARU
(VOICEOVER): Of course.

174
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,539
You're one of the elite now.

175
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,108
A righteous warrior.

176
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,111
How naughty of you to be
using the forbidden jutsu

177
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,412
I taught you.

178
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,616
[grunts]

179
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,884
-It won't work, Uncle.

180
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,403
-Why are you here?

181
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:01,904
-I'm disappointed.

182
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:06,643
I expected a friendlier
reception after all this time.

183
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:10,213
-Don't tell me you've come here
to assassinate Lord Hokage?

184
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:11,681
-No, not yet.

185
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,919
I don't have quite enough
followers to attempt that.

186
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,454
But I've heard such good
things about this village,

187
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:20,024
I thought I might
want to make it mine.

188
00:15:20,057 --> 00:15:23,128
[moaning]

189
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,130
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's the mark, isn't it?

190
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:28,066
I put that same curse
mark on a young man

191
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,768
just a little while ago.

192
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:34,340
He's a very promising prospect.

193
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,375
-You haven't changed, I see.

194
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:39,278
He'll die before he serves you.

195
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,013
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Very possibly.

196
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:44,617
I'd say the odds are
1 and 10 against him.

197
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:47,821
But the kid may
survive, as you did.

198
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,125
-Sounds like you
want him badly, huh?

199
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,596
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Oh, jealous, is that it?

200
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,131
You can't forgive me, can you?

201
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,503
For using you, and
then tossing you aside.

202
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,072
[growls]

203
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:06,141
-In some ways, the boy has even
more potential than you had.

204
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,744
You see, he's inherited
the sublime abilities

205
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,180
of the Uchiha clan.

206
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:14,651
[chuckles] And his physical
condition is excellent.

207
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,988
Yes, he might very well be
the heir I'm looking for.

208
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,924
At the very least, he
makes things interesting.

209
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:26,698
Whatever happens, make sure
no one stops the exams early.

210
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:29,867
Three of my followers
are also candidates.

211
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,070
I look forward to
seeing how they fare.

212
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,075
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Bear this in mind.

213
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,546
If anything happens to
deprive me of my fun,

214
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,949
it means the end of
the Leaf Village.

215
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:56,464
NINJA (VOICEOVER): All right.

216
00:16:56,497 --> 00:16:58,766
That's enough
resting up, I think.

217
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,936
The other teams will be
calling it a day soon.

218
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,174
And that means,
it's time to strike.

219
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,476
You know the plan.

220
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,010
We split up and fan out.

221
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,747
Whatever happens, whether we
make contact with another team

222
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,351
or not, we meet up
back here in this spot.

223
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:17,920
Got it?

224
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,855
-No sweat.

225
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,257
-Roger.

226
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,624
-All right then.

227
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:22,225
Let's move!

228
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:32,570
[moaning]

229
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:35,674
-At least he's finally
breathing easier now.

230
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,141
But he's still got a high fever.

231
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,655
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Looks like it's up to me

232
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:50,757
for the time being.

233
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:06,908
ANKO (VOICEOVER): I've
wasted enough time.

234
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,911
Somebody's got to
tell Lord Hokage.

235
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:16,852
-Huh?

236
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,891
[sighs]

237
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:34,772
[gasps]

238
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,382
-I don't have time for this!

239
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,070
[moaning]

240
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:04,865
[roars]

241
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,018
ANKO (VOICEOVER): It's
a paralysis jutsu!

242
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,220
ANBU TEAM 1 (VOICEOVER):
So there you are, Anko!

243
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,237
-Man, you Anbu goons took your
time getting here, didn't you?

244
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,439
-Well, there's no
need to get snippy.

245
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:40,712
[moaning]

246
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,547
-Anko, are you all right?

247
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,849
What is it?

248
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,985
That curse mark has appeared.

249
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,223
But that means, Orochimaru!

250
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,090
-What, here?

251
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:52,925
No!

252
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,759
ANBU TEAM 1 (VOICEOVER): Hurry!

253
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,094
Let's get you up.

254
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,264
We'll carry you to Lord
Hokage if we have to.

255
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:58,965
-No.

256
00:19:58,998 --> 00:19:59,666
No.

257
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,734
Take me to the tower.

258
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,068
-What are you talking about?

259
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,637
You know we have
to raise the alarm

260
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,873
at the first sign of Orochimaru.

261
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,542
That's more important
than the Chunin Exams.

262
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:11,746
-I know, but-- All right, then.

263
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,814
Summon Lord Hokage to the tower.

264
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,383
I'll explain everything there.

265
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,096
[chuckling]

266
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,699
DOSU (VOICEOVER): Found you.

267
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:30,700
All right.

268
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:31,968
Just as Orochimaru ordered.

269
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,237
We strike at daybreak.

270
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:37,875
And remember, our
target is the Uchiha.

271
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,777
-Yeah, but if the other
two get in our way,

272
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,845
it's OK if we take
'em out, right?

273
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,849
DOSU (VOICEOVER): Of course.

274
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:47,051
[birds chirping]

275
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,459
[gasps]

276
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:18,986
[music playing]

277
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,489
[speaking Japanese]

278
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,988
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
It is I, Rock Lee,

279
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:54,225
handsome devil of the
Hidden Leaf Village.

280
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:57,629
Everything is turning out
just as I planned, Guy Sensei.

281
00:22:57,662 --> 00:23:00,232
What better way to win
the lovely Sakura's heart,

282
00:23:00,265 --> 00:23:01,599
than by rescuing her?

283
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:04,703
Some might say I am
seriously outnumbered,

284
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,204
but that is the best part.

285
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:07,806
It means the conditions
have been met,

286
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,211
and I can finally unleash my--
Well, my special talent, right,

287
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:13,046
Sensei?

288
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,746
Next time, Bushy Brow's Pledge.

289
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,546
Undying Love and Protection!
