[rustling]

173
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,108
Huh?

174
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:26,145
Fake rocks?

175
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:27,713
What's up with that?

-[panting]

177
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,506
That's the worse
disguise of all time.

178
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,075
There's no such thing
as square rocks.

179
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:00,077
It's completely obvious!

180

KID: You saw through
my camouflage again.

181
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,380
You're slick, boss.

182
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,750
Just what I'd expect
from my greatest rival.

-I think we used a little
too much gunpowder, you guys.

-I'm Moegi.

The sassiest kunoichi
in preschool.

Check me out!

-I love algebra.

Call me Udon!

-And I'm the number 1
ninja in the village.

Konohamaru!

193
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,381
And when we're all together--

194
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:42,351
ALL: --we're the
Konohamaru Ninja Squad!

00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,254
-Yeah, I knew it
was you, Konohamaru.

196
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,656
Hm, hey, what are those things?

197
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,158
Those goggles you're
wearing on your head?

198

-[laughs]

199
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,329
You used to wear
goggles, remember?

200
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,197
So we're copying you!

201

-Hey, come on, boss.

203
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,402
Why are you being like that?

204
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,972
You ought to be more excited!

205
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,208
-So did you want something?

206
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:07,775
-He's just trying to be cool.

207
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,044
-You know what we want.

208
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:11,379
Are you busy now?

209
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:14,749
-Hm, I have to train.

210
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,083
Believe it!

211
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,619
-What?

212
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,921
But you promised that you
will play ninja with us today.

213
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:20,888
Come on!

214

-Uh, he-he.

215
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:23,758
Oh, did I say that?

216
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,960
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Uh,
if I say yes, these kids

217
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,361
will keep bugging me all day.

218
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:29,797
And I won't get
any training done.

219
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,833
-[sighs] A ninja playing ninja?

220
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,400
That is so twisted.

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,674
-Uhh.

222
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:41,975
Hey, Sakura.

223
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,645
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): My ninja
skills are worse than his?

224
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,246
Unbelievable!

225
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,348
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Uhh,
she's staring right at me.

226
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:50,617
I think I'm turning red.

Who's that girl anyway?

[grunts]

231
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:01,527
KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER): The
way she's staring at him,

232
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,664
it's like her eyes are daggers.

233
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:05,631
-Ah!

234
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:06,999
I get it.

235
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:08,868
You're a smooth operator, boss.

-Uhh.

-Come on, I know that
she's your girlfriend.

-Huh?

-[chuckles]

240
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:21,881
Well, you could tell she's
really crazy about me, huh?

-Oh, no!

248
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:39,030
We got to check his pulse.

-I don't even think she's human.

Did you see how wide
her forehead is?

Ugh!

Huh?

00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,267
-Do you need something?

00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,901
-Huh?

273
00:14:58,935 --> 00:14:59,468
-Uhh.

-All right.

275
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:10,379
Thanks for the report,
Kakashi-sensei.

276
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,713
How's Naruto doing?

277
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:14,250
Is he getting along OK
with the other students?

278
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:15,584
-Hm?

279
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:19,388
Well, uh, little by little.

280
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:22,758
-It's been so busy around here.

281
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,260
I haven't seen him since he
got back from the mission

282
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:27,295
to the Land of Waves.

283
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,397
I'm a little worried about him.

284
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,601
-Uh, you know, Sasuke
is also in our group.

285
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,436
Naruto sees him
as a rival, which

286
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,572
puts a constant
strain on the group.

287
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,807
But it also pushes
Naruto to excel.

288
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,343
So he's making amazing progress.

289
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:44,144
Someday, his skills
may be so strong,

290
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:47,782
they'll match the person he
respects most in the world--

291
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:48,749
you.

292

Huh.

Hmm, I wonder.

00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:11,871
Now?

00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,050
-Hm.

00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,650
-Konohamaru!

-[grunts]

00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,890
-Put him down, Kankuro.

304
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,193
Or you know you'll
pay for it later.

305
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,328
-Hey, I'm sorry.

306
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,596
The whole thing was my fault.

307
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,097
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Who are they?

308
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,633
What are they?

309
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,803
-You better take your
hands off him right now!

310
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,741
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): So these
are the Leaf Village's Genin.

311
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,843
-We got a few minutes
before he gets here.

312
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,111
Let's mess with
these punks, huh?

-[grunts]

314
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,650
Let go of me, you jerk!

315
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:01,986
-You're feisty,
but not for long.

Aah!

320
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:25,142
What the-- what was that?

321
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,810
-You're a Leaf Genin, too?

322
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:29,946
Looks like your village
is full of wimps.

323
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,348
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): They are
outsiders from somewhere.

324
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:35,318
But what are they doing here?

325
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:38,889
-Uhh, Konohamaru!

326
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:40,891
-Konohamaru!

327
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,258
-Konohamaru!

328
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,228
-Hey, cut it out.

329
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,229
It hurts!

330
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:50,733
-That's it!

331
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,768
Drop him now, or
I take you apart.

332
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:55,671
You got that, fool!

00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:56,972
-You're the fool!

334
00:17:57,006 --> 00:18:01,276
Making threats isn't
going to help, Naruto.

335
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,544
-You're annoying.

336
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,046
All of you.

337
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,917
I don't like runts or any
other scrawny weaklings.

338
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,053
So when a wimp like this
starts shooting off his mouth--

339
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,555
-Ow!

340
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:15,657
---I just want to
break him in half.

341
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,625
[both gasp]

342
00:18:16,658 --> 00:18:19,127
[both whimper]

343
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,695
-[sighs] Fine.

344
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:23,231
I'm not involved
in any of this, OK?

345
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:25,534
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
What's this guy's problem?

346
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,936
This is getting ugly.

347
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,604
-First, I'll take care
of this little squirt.

348
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:34,008
Then I'll waste the other one.

349
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:34,720
-Nooo!

350
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:37,878
-Agh!

351
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:38,846
Uhh.

352
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:40,181
-Ugh.

353
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:42,150
Huh?

354
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:42,750
Huh.

355
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,156
[grunts]

356
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:54,461
-You're a long way from home,
and you're way out your league.

357
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:55,062
-Sasuke!

358
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:00,968
-[moans]

359
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,402
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Well, well!

360
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:04,304
Local hottie.

361
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:04,904
-Naruto!

362
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,508
-Oh, great.

363
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,377
Another wimp to tick me off.

364
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:14,381
-Get lost.

365
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,853
-[shrieks] So cool!

366
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:23,589
-Hmm.

367
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,192
-How come you're
not cool like that?

368
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:27,326
Huh?

369
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,760
-What do you mean?

370
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,997
I could have taken that guy
out in two seconds flat.

371
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,031
-Humph.

372
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:32,998
-[snarls]

373
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,533
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, you're

374
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:37,369
always trying to make me look
bad in front of everyone!

375
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,538
[growls]

376
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:42,107
-Hey, punk, get down here.

377
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:48,446
You're the kind of pesky
little snot I hate the most.

378
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:53,384
All attitude and
nothing to back it up.

379
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:54,619
-What?

380
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,720
Are you going to use
the Crow for this?

381
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:06,631
-Kankuro, back off.

382
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,500
-Uh.

383
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,035
[all gasp]

384
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:18,042
You're an embarrassment
to our village.

385
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:19,043
-Huh!

386
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:20,010
-Uh.

387
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:20,810
-Huh.

388
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,614
-Uh, ah, hey, Gaara.

389
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:26,650
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
How did he get there?

390
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,686
He didn't make a sound.

391
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,922
Only Jonin at Kakashi's
level are that smooth.

392
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,066
MALE SPEAKER: I
have summoned you

393
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,902
for a very important purpose.

394
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,071
Seeing your fellow
Jonin here, I'm

395
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,339
sure you realize
what this is about.

396
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,607
-So soon?

397
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,976
I thought we'd have
a little more time.

398
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,778
-I'd take it all
the other lands have

399
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,813
been notified about
the coming event.

400
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,682
I know that some of
their Genin have already

401
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,817
arrived here in the village.

402
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,386
-And when do we start?

403
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,022
-We will begin in one week.

404
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,556
-That's pretty short notice.

405
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,098
-Take heed.

406
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:20,568
Exactly seven days from
today, on the 1st day of July,

407
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:23,671
the Genin will be
gathered and tested.

408
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:26,173
Only the very best will
be selected as Jonin.

409
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:49,195
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

410
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:52,365
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

411
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:56,169
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

412
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:59,505
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

413
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:06,279
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

414
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:09,382
Sneaking out of the
classroom by the backdoor.

415
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:13,286
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

416
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,490
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

417
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:20,459
Don't try to live so wise.

418
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:23,262
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

419
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:27,632
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

420
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,435
will hate yourself in the end.

421
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:43,081
Don't try to live so wise.

422
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:46,450
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

423
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:50,621
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

424
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:53,557
will hate yourself in the end.

425
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:56,928
Don't try to live so wise.

426
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:00,498
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

427
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:02,065
Don't try with--

428
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:07,104
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): All right!

429
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,306
It's time for the Chunin Exam.

430
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,342
If I pass the test, I
won't be a Genin anymore.

431
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,445
I'll be one giant step
closer to becoming Hokage.

432
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,415
No way I can fail, right?

433
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:20,750
Hey, who snatched Moegi?

434
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,652
What the heck are they up to?

435
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:23,954
Come back here!

436
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,455
You're not getting away!

437
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,961
Next time, "Identify Yourself,
Powerful New Rivals."

438
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:30,661
It doesn't matter who shows up.

439
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:33,228
I'll beat them all!
