Quick, your medicine!

I just got back.

Now, I have to clean the room.

13
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,389
Please be sure to take
your medicine, will you?

14
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:55,123
-That medicine will do
nothing for me, you simpleton!

15
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:57,789
-But I made it
specifically for you.

16
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:01,456
It should ease your
pain, at least, a little.

17

-This burning in
my arms, I never

18

imagined the suffering
would be great.

19
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:11,856
-It was Sarutobi after
all, the Third Hokage.

20
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,456
This was his final curse.

-Enough of your prattling.

Tell me, have you
found the one I seek?

-Yes.

24
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:23,823
The trail led to a place
called Tanzaku Town.

25
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:25,056
-Tanzaku Town.

is one of the legendary Sannin.

-Hm?

35
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,423
It's the same mark.

36
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,256
I don't get it.

37
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:02,756
How is this supposed to help?

38
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,323
-You're the kind of
kid who got yelled

39
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:07,423
at in the academy for lack
of concentration, aren't you?

40
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,523
-I don't see what that
has to do with this.

41
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:13,089
-Look at this piece of paper.

42
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:14,789
-Hm?

43
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,156
I've seen it.

44
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,223
-All right.

45
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:20,656
Now, if you will,
give it a second look.

46
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:23,856
-Huh?

47
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:31,756
What am I looking at?

48
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:34,089
-Well, I don't think it's
going to help a whole lot if I

49
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,323
explain too much right away.

50
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:38,323
But the first time you
looked at this paper,

51
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:41,523
your eyes just glanced at
the whole thing, am I right?

52
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:42,823
-Probably.

53
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,856
-And what about the
second time you looked?

54
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,889
Most likely, the
point in the middle?

55
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,289
-Huh?

56
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:55,023
-Any time that a person's eyes
gaze on a blank sheet of paper,

57
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,656
they don't focus where to look.

58
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,589
The eyes just wander the page.

59
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:05,023
But if you put even a dot on
it, the mind is drawn there.

60
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:08,623
You're then concentrating
on a single point.

61
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:13,956
And with that focus comes
spiritual stability,

62
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:17,489
letting you tap into
unimaginable power.

63
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,389
-Hm.

64
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:22,489
-When you finally broke open
the hole in the rubber ball,

65
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,656
I'm sure you must have
been trying desperately

66
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,223
to gather up the
chakra you needed

67
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,423
in the palm of your hand.

68
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,756
-Uh, yeah, that's right!

69
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,356
JIRAIYA: When you concentrate,
you draw out power.

70
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,323
But without some sort of target,
concentration can be difficult;

71
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:38,623
hence, that mark.

72
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:40,023
Now, listen, Naruto.

73
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:43,823
From now on, when you're storing
up power in your right hand,

74
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:48,523
make sure that you
concentrate only on that mark.

75
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,156
-Concentrate.

76
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,189
All right!

77
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,456

This training,
you must do alone.

You can attain the level of

it on your own.

long ago, thanks to the lady.

Lovely.

150

-Her losses were
really piling up,

151
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,156
so she went looking for
a change of scenery.

152
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:37,723
-Where to?

153
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:42,056
-Tanzaku Town-- Tsunade,

TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
I got three 7s?

169
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:42,871
MAN: Holy smokes, lady!

170
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:45,338
-Yeah, not a bad haul.

171
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,671
-Wish I had that kind of luck.

172
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:48,171
CROWD: Oh!

173
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:48,871
Ho-ho!

174
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,204
MAN: She did it again!

175
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:51,171
-All right!

176
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,104
Looks like the fever's raging!

177
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:01,604
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): I
never hit it this big.

178
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,238
I'm getting a bad feeling here.

179
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:09,504
-I have a little knowledge
of Lady Tsunade myself.

180
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:13,238
I was a member of the
medical corps after all.

181
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,038
She was the first
to propose what's

182
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,138
now a very common
practice for each squad

183
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,471
to have a medical
specialist included.

184
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,004
Simple but brilliant.

185
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,538
It was a landmark idea.

186
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,204
What becomes of a squad on
the battlefield with no one

187
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,804
to administer emergency
medical treatment?

188
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:33,138
The answer is clearer
than a fire in the night.

189
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,438
OROCHIMARU: Hah, countless
years on the battlefield

190
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:43,471
have simply taught them how to
cope with the ravages of war.

191
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:47,738
All those who were sacrificed
led to the method you speak of.

192
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:51,271
And one only truly grasps
the value of something

193
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,071
once it has been
taken away from you.

194
00:12:54,104 --> 00:13:00,171
This revolutionary idea enacted
by one of the legendary Sannin,

195
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:05,071
hailed for her medical prowess,
spawned in that sacrifice.

196
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:13,738
-It's no good.

197
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,038
I have to concentrate
even harder.

198
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,604
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Concentrate.

199
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,338
Concentrate.

200
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:24,571
Concentrate.

201
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,704
Concentrate.

202
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,204
Concentrate.

203
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:36,171
Concentrate.

204
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:42,004
Concentrate on one point only.

205
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,338
-Strike!

206
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,738
Strike!

207
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,171
Strike!

208
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,071
Strike!

209
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:59,171
-[guffaws]

210
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,171
-Strike!

211
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:03,638
-[guffaws]

212
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:06,871
How can I concentrate with
that stupid perv's face popping

213
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,104
into my head?

214
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,904
-Ahchoo!

215
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:11,738
Well, what do you know?

216
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,504
Some gal out there must
be talking about me.

217
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:18,371
Jiraiya, how do you do it?

218
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,604
-Lady Tsunade,
wait up, will you?

219
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:22,838
What's the matter?

220
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,771
For you to win this much
is, well, a miracle.

221
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,704
But you don't look
happy in the least.

222
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,871
-This town--

223
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,771
-Huh?

224
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,671
-Something's not right here.

225
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,371
Hurry up, we're leaving.

226
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:38,571
-Wha-- but this is
a tourist resort.

227
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:41,938
We should take our time,
go see the historic castle.

228
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:44,404
-Well, look fast, so
we can get out of here.

229
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:46,904
-But, Lady Tsunade!

230
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,671
-Uhh. [groans]

231
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:49,838
-Lord Orochimaru.

232
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:53,271
-Let's get this
business over with.

233
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,071
Even if we need to get
a little more forceful.

234
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,571
-I've got to do it.

235
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:08,504
Ow!

236
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:09,338
Ouch!

237
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:11,504
I can't even build up chakra.

238
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,471
It hurts so much!

239
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,738
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): I think
he's almost at his limit.

240
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:21,871
-[sighs]

241
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,838
[pants]

242
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:30,938
I just need a little more
time to rest, that's all.

243
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:03,838
Uh.

244
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:10,571
BOY: Hey!

245
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:11,671
We're still in class here!

246
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,671
[laughs]

247
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,504
SENSEI: You foolish runts!

248
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:21,704
[grunts]

249
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,471
You guys don't
have a single ounce

250
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:26,038
of concentration
between the four of you!

251
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:29,571
You are all far from the path
to becoming excellent shinobi!

252
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,904
-Sorry, but I wasn't made
to sit still at a desk.

253
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,004
Right, Akamaru?

254
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:36,138
[dog barks]

255
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,271
-[yawns]

256
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:38,504
Man, I'm hungry.

257
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,404
-Sensei, is this
lecture almost done?

258
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:46,438
-Why, you-- you, you,
you little-- from now

259
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,338
on, you guys are
staying after school

260
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,004
to work on your concentration!

261
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:51,438
BOYS: [moaning]

262
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:51,938
Hm?

263
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:52,438
Huh?

264
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,871
Hm?

265
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:56,738
-[chuckles]

266
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,738
-What's this for?

267
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,938
-You're about to take
up a custom passed down

268
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:03,104
through generations of
the Hidden Leaf Village

269
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,338
for sharpening the mind.

270
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:10,171
By concentrating all your energy
on the leaf on your foreheads,

271
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:13,171
you will learn to
build up your chakra.

272
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:15,204
It is an ancient wisdom.

273
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:19,704
By focusing on that single
leaf, nothing can distract you.

274
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,971
-Hm?

275
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:24,404
-He who hones his concentration
is truly a great ninja.

276
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:28,171
This is the origin of the
leaf symbol that we wear.

277
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:29,871
-Quit pulling our leg.

278
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,804
-You sure you didn't
just make that story up

279
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:33,304
to get us to work harder?

280
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,904
-No, I'm not making it up!

281
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:35,904
It was all true!

282
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:37,871
-Anyway, you can't
become a great ninja

283
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,904
just by polishing
your concentration.

284
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:42,404
-Besides, everyone knows if you
want to be an awesome ninja,

285
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,738
you got to be strong!

286
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,171
-He does have a point.

287
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:46,671
-Stuff like this?

288
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:47,671
Pfff!

289
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:48,671
-Aaah!

290
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:50,538
NARUTO: Catch you later, Sensei!

291
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,471
[boys laugh]

292
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,338
-Now, you boys, wait a minute!

293
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,271
-As if!

294
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:56,538
-No time, sorry!

295
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,371
-Hey!

296
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:58,638
You ungrateful little misfits!

297
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:06,338
-This is the same thing.

298
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,771
[sighs]

299
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,471
I should have paid
more attention

300
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,071
to what Iruka Sensei
was telling us.

301
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,238
I'm so stupid.

302
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:21,904
Well, I guess there's no use
crying over spilled milk.

303
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,238
All right, here we go.

304
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:30,871
I'm doing this, no matter what!

305
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:42,071
Concentrate,
concentrate, concentrate.

306
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:46,571
SHIZUNE: Wow!

307
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,504
Tanzaku Castle sure does
have a commanding presence.

308
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:52,904
Oh, they didn't designate it a
cultural landmark for nothing,

309
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:54,938
I suppose.

310
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:56,904
TSUNADE: Stop
lollygagging around.

311
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:59,204
We have to get out of this town.

312
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,004
-But, uh, don't you want
to get a better peek at it?

313
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,538
It doesn't cost anything
to look, you know?

314
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,504
Hm?

315
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:09,504
Lady Tsunade?

316
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,404
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): What
is this chill I'm feeling?

317
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:43,804
[whooshing]

318
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,704
-This is it!

319
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:53,204
Haaah!

320
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:58,671
Hrrh!

321
00:19:58,704 --> 00:19:59,171
Hrrrh!

322
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:05,638
[blast]

323
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,138
Aagh!

324
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,938
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): This
kid is something else.

325
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:34,404
The chakra was so dense,
it burned his palm.

326
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:36,904
Hah, one surprise after another.

327
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,804
-Heh, what do you know?

328
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:45,671
It finally popped.

329
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,838
-Well done.

330
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,138
It looks like you've
mastered the second step.

331
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:50,371
-Come on, then.

332
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:52,304
Let me hear the third one.

333
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,271
-That'll have to wait for now.

334
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,171
It's time for us to
meet up with Tsunade.

335
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:09,104
-Isn't that--

336
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,804
-Orochimaru!

337
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:18,771
-[snickers]

338
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:26,704
I finally found you.

339
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,966

340
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,289
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can't
concentrate on my training

341
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:03,423
while we're walking.

342
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:04,356
Give me a minute.

343
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:05,523
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
You halfwit!

344
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:07,623
If we don't hustle here,
we're going to lose her.

345
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:10,289
And anyway, kid, I'm running
out of patience with you.

346
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:11,389
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Where are we headed?

347
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,589
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
If she's in this town,

348
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:14,356
we'll need a higher
vantage point to look from.

349
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:15,789
So we're climbing up the castle.

350
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:16,923
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Castle?

351
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:17,656
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
It's over there.

352
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,823
Can't you see it?

353
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,289
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Which
way is "over there"?

354
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:22,223
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
I'm telling you-- huh?

355
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:24,989
Wha-- what in the world?

356
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,189
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "An Impossible Choice,

357
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:29,489
the Pain Within
Tsunade's Heart."

358
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:33,023
