168
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,541
that the seal will hold?

169
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:58,180
Do you think you can keep him
from what he truly desires?

170
00:14:58,214 --> 00:14:59,682
You know I'm right.

171
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:03,020
A heart like his, that
hungers for only one thing,

172
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:07,025
will not be denied, no
matter what obstacles you

173
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,693
put in his path.

174
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,330
He's an Avenger, isn't he?

175
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:14,133
-You think you can
take advantage of that?

176
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,036
Not Sasuke.

177
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:18,038
-You cannot stop it.

178
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:25,881
At some point, he will come
to me, in search of power.

179
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:30,253
Unless of course you carry
out your threat to kill me.

180
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:32,589
Now is your chance.

181
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,024
Take it, if you dare.

182
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:47,675
[breathing shakily]

183
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:52,581
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): "One
of us will die here."

184
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,549
I must have been out of my mind.

185
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,996
[cries out]

186
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,375
-I'd say this one has had it.

187
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,077
The winner is Shino Aburame.

188
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:26,623
-Wait.

189
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:28,091
How did he do that?

190
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,226
Who is he?

191
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,027
Find out.

192
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,298
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Byakugan.

193
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:42,108
-[gasp] I had no idea.

194
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:44,178
I thought he must be
using a summoning jutsu

195
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,981
to get all those
insects, but no.

196
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,651
They're actually
living inside of him.

197
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:52,421
-Living inside of him?

198
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,590
-There's a legend
in the Leaf Village

199
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:56,960
of a clan of insect tamers.

200
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,496
-Yes, I've heard of
that clan as well.

201
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,000
They say that when a
bug master is born,

202
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:05,571
he enters into a sacred
pact with the insects.

203
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,940
He allows them to
nest in his body.

204
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,410
In return, they obey
their host's will.

205
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:15,116
They serve him, answering his
call, fighting his battles

206
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:16,818
and destroying his enemies.

207
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,388
I've also heard that they
allow the insects to feed

208
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,356
on their chakra as
part of the bargain.

209
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,305
-So this guy is one of them?

210
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,940
One of these bug-tamers? tamers?

211
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:41,248
DOSU: Well, that
was unfortunate.

212
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,517
-What just happened?

213
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,053
How come his arms
broke down like that?

214
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,822
-At some point
early in the match,

215
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,926
this guy Shino managed to get
his beetles into Zaku's Wind

216
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,695
Cannon and plugged the opening.

217
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,666
As soon as Zaku tried to
use his Slicing Sound Wave,

218
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,800
he was doomed.

219
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,903
With its usual
outlet sealed off,

220
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:02,041
the energy from the Sound
Wave was trapped in his arm,

221
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:06,079
expanding, searching
for an exit.

222
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:09,683
Sooner or later,
something had to give.

223
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,185
In this case, it was Zaku.

224
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:22,699
I can't pretend we had
anything in common,

225
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,770
except this team
and our mission.

226
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:30,442
Still, I'll even the
score for you, Zaku.

227
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,211
[low chortle]

228
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:37,317
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): [sigh] My,
it's getting chilly in here.

229
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,786
-Man, that Shino is good.

230
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,822
Who woulda thunk it
with him being so quiet?

231
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:43,124
I can't wait to
get my shot at him!

232
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:46,762
-Whoa, Why thought Shino
was weird before, but now--

233
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:56,140
-Oh, wow, I, uh--
congratulations, Shino.

234
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,075
-Way to go.

235
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:57,675
Good work.

236
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:58,811
SHINO: Hmf.

237
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:00,313
Just see that you
two do the same.

238
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,085
AKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Grrr.

239
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,153
Yeah?

240
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,255
Who died and made
you team leader, huh?

241
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,929
-Uh, all right, everyone.

242
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:16,566
Moving right on to
the third match.

243
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,634
-Hnh.

244
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,203
Huh?

245
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:22,005
-Kakashi-sensei!

246
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:22,773
-Hi.

247
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,275
-What do you mean, hi?

248
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:25,577
Is that all you can say?

249
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,213
Wh-what about--
what about Sasuke?

250
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,181
How is he?

251
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:30,550
-Oh, he's fine.

252
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,352
Sleeping soundly
in the infirmary.

253
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,357
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): But
he's been put under guard

254
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,493
by the Anbu Black Ops.

255
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,461
[gasp]

256
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Heh.

257
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,802
Finally, my turn.

258
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,304
BAKI (VOICEOVER):
Careful, Kankuro.

259
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:50,908
You'll underestimate your
opponent one time too many.

260
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,077
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Hmf.

261
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,218
Idiot.

262
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,934
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This guy!

263
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,979
-I'm not like Yoroi.

264
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:25,217
I don't get careless,
not even against kids.

265
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,420
-Heh.

266
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,122
KANKURO: A piece of advice.

267
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:33,461
Once I go into my
jutsu, give up quick.

268
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:37,666
If you do, I promise to
make it short and painless.

269
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:42,372
-Funny, I was about
to say the same thing.

270
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,541
Though I can't promise
it'll be painless.

271
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,384
-All right, then.

272
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,488
If you're ready, let
the third match begin.

273
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:05,567
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

274
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:36,379
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): We're
not little girls anymore,

275
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:37,714
are we, Ino?

276
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,818
When I think back on those
days, how I used to idolize you?

277
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:43,254
I wanted to be just like you.

278
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:46,958
But I'm grown up now, and my
goals are a little higher.

279
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:49,061
I want to prove I'm
better than you.

280
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:53,033
And if I can't, I don't
deserve to be here.

281
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,808
Next time: Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious.

282
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:00,141
The fun and games are over, Ino!
