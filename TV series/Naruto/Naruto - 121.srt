KIBA (VOICEOVER):
Where'd other one go?

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,644
Boo.

4
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:07,710
Looking for someone, kid?

5
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,677
Go wash your eyes in that river.

6
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,210
I'll take care of the rest.

7
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,977
A unique ability, I know.

8
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,177
Helps with assassination.

9
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,844
A sharp sense of smell
and a set of claws

10
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,944
aren't gonna be
enough to beat me.

Face it.

12
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,910
You're in over your

Sorry, Akamaru.

00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:47,477
We've always been a team,
together, wherever we went.

16
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,244
But I think this time,
we're sunk, old friend.

17
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:56,244
-My cells are swimming
freely throughout your body.

18
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,610
I can even generate parts
that are solely yours.

19
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:03,310
In other words, we're
slowly fusing together.

20
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,444
We'll be sharing a body.

-Sharing a body?

22
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,444
-That's right.

23
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:13,944
I'm going to snuff out
your life as only I can,

24
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:18,944
by eradicating all the cells in
your body from the inside out.

-What if I do this?

29
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,344
Then what happens?

the same body,

I guess you feel whatever
I feel, don't you?

-Damn you.

39
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,644
Invading my opponent's
body has always

40
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:47,344
the surest way of
avoiding attack.

41

It's my jutsu's
greatest advantage.

No one before has ever turned
it against me like this.

-It hurts, doesn't it?

00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,844
Well, come on.

45
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:01,944
I know one way to stop the pain.

blood for a fatal blow.

Huh?

So, he ran away and left
his little doggie behind.

59
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,710
A logical decision, but pretty
coldblooded, even for me.

use his own bone as a sword?

-It's no use.

148
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:06,071
This is no ordinary bone.

149
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,971
It's of the highest density.

150
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,838
As hard as tempered steel.

-So what?

00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:22,138
They're close.

171
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,138
I left a trail of blood
leading right to me!

172
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:38,338
Well, Akamaru, that trick
bought us some time,

173
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,538
but it looks like I may
have gotten a little carried

174
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,271
away with it.

175
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:45,505
Well.

176
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,905
That scent.

177
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:06,338
Wait a minute.

178
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,671
Why?

179
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,638
What the hell would
they be doing here?

180
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,605
I don't know what's going
on, but one thing's for sure.

181
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:16,038
We gotta beat it-- fast.

182
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:23,638
No way.

183
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:24,971
I'm too dizzy.

184
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,305
I've lost too much blood.

185
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,505
Afraid I'm in no better
shape than you are, boy.

186
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,505
Sorry, Akamaru.

187
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:08,571
[shout]

188
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,138
-Where did the rest of him go?

189
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:13,571
Huh?

190
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:22,305
So he's traveling
by water now, huh?

191
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:23,705
What a clever boy.

192
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:32,438
-What a drag.

193
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:32,971
Uh-oh!

194
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,705
-It's over.

195
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:45,005
There's nowhere
to run this time.

196
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,605
You're trapped like a rat.

197
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:52,138
-Gotta admit, that wasn't bad.

198
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,238
Timing was perfect.

199
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:57,005
You got all three of them
right where you wanted them.

200
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,771
That's quite a tricky tune.

201
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,505
Something like that must
take a lot of practice.

202
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,471
-It does, actually.

203
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,438
So you figured out I
was manipulating them

204
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,305
with my flute.

205
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,505
You're not as dumb as you look.

206
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:16,338
Not that it'll do you any good.

207
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,838
Knowing what I've
been doing isn't

208
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,971
the same as knowing
how to stop me.

209
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,838
-You've got a point there.

210
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,638
I never was very musical.

211
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:27,171
Just ask my mom and dad.

212
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,638
(VOICEOVER) With that flute,
she can manipulate her buddies

213
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,038
like puppets.

214
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,971
That song's comprised
of sequences

215
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:36,105
of modulated sound waves,
each sequence controlling

216
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:39,305
a specific movement.

217
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,705
Great, Shikamaru.

218
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,205
You can analyze it fine.

219
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,005
But what are you going
to do to counteract it?

220
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,738
She's right.

221
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:54,538
The fact remains I've
got no ear for music.

222
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:57,938
-No one's ever heard
this song and lived.

223
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,305
Here's the finale,
Ninth Passage.

224
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,571
Demon Revolution.

225
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:06,538

226
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,505
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
She changed the tune!

227
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:36,385
[theme music]

228
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,915
SHIKAMARU: Gotta hand it to her.

229
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,648
She's playing this chess
game like a grandmaster.

230
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,482
With those three
pawns she's summoned,

231
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:11,548
she's got me outnumbered,
outwitted, and out of position.

232
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:14,382
I feel like I'm already
down two rooks and a queen.

233
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,015
And with worse to come.

234
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:16,882
So what now?

235
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,348
Pack it in?

236
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:21,048
That's be the smart move, but no
one's ever called me a genius.

237
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:23,082
I gotta wager
everything on this.

238
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:25,048
NARUTO: Next time, Fake Out!

239
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:25,948
Shikamaru's Comeback.
