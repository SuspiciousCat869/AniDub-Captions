-So to fight the master, I must
first fight the puppets, huh?

4
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,109
Very well.

00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:20,589
Ahh!

6
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:28,823
Haha, you think a
wall of wood can

7
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,463
block my path into
a glorious tomorrow?

8
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,600
With the power of youth,
I have the strength

00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,804
to break through any barrier.

10
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,609
I can overcome anything
with hot blooded effort.

00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,645
With eyes on tomorrow, I strike!

12
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:49,526
Forget about tomorrow,
what about today?

13
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,535
This is no ordinary barrier.

-Hmm?

17
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,880
Is that Yagura?

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,685
Are you all right?

19
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,889
-Haha.

20
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,859
I'm fine, but I'm not Yagura.

21
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:17,273
I am the eldest of the
Brothers Ryudoin, Gensho.

22
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,377
-I'm the second
brother, Rokkaku.

23
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:22,616
-And I'm the youngest, Jako.

24
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:25,321
-Ryodoin.

25
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,489
Hmm.

26
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,559
That name is vaguely familiar.

27
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:29,328
-What?

28
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,631
You don't remember?

29
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:34,737
-Perhaps you remember our
father, Agira Ryudoin,

30
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,775
a mighty warrior who fell
victim to the cowardly tactics

31
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,712
of the Leaf Village ninja.

32
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:42,250
You prevented him from
fulfilling his missions

33
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,721
and he eventually
died of despair.

34
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,692
-Our father's hatred of you
lasted until the very end.

35
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:50,764
Your name was on his lips
as he lay on his death bed.

36
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,602
He told us to seek
out Guy of the Leaf

37
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:54,738
and do battle with him.

38
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:57,476
-On the very day he
died, we his sons

39
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,914
vowed never to rest
until we had vengeance.

40
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:02,451
-We've been waiting for the
chance to even the score,

41
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,923
to make you pay for
what you did to him.

42
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,558
-Ah, yes.

43
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:08,828
Of course, Agira.

44
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:11,634
Yes, I remember
that battle well.

45
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,470
A heroic struggle.

46
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,175
Your father was the most
noble and worthy opponent.

47
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,680
What a splendid fight it was.

48
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,449
I shall feature it
prominently when

49
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:23,321
I write my eight-volume
history of Might Guy's most

50
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:23,955
memorable battles.

51
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,702
A clash of warriors, each
following his ninja way.

52
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:40,483
It was an honorable
battle between equals.

53
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:41,852
I'm sure your
father would agree,

54
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,791
so let's just stop this nonsense
before someone gets hurt,

55
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:45,625
shall we?

56
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,928
-Fool.

57
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,868
We won't stop until we do to
you what you did to our father.

58
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:02,033
-Yah!

59
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,642
Yes, Sakura.

60
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:18,616
I know you have been out
there watching for a while.

-Lady Tsunade wanted
me to come and make

62

overdo it, that's all.

63
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:23,725
-What is it?

64
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:24,592
What are you hiding?

65
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:25,661
-Hiding?

66
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:26,997
What do you mean?

67
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,967
Nothing!

68
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,904
-You do not have a
gift for lying, Sakura.

69
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:38,316
-Huh?

70
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,734
-Vengeance will be ours.

71
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:49,335
Now die!

72
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:53,877
-All right, you guys.

73
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:56,347
Break it up!

74
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,384
You're the phony
Yagura, aren't you?

75
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:02,325
What are you up to, trying
to infiltrate our village?

76
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,727

They have Guy Sensei in there.

79
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,742
They've infused the
walls of that structure

80
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,278
with their chakra.

81
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,380
-Not for long.

82
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:22,459
-Ahh!

83
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,904
-Hang in there,
Bushier Brows Sensei.

84
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,373
Don't worry, we're coming!

Ha.

00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,928
You really think you can
stop us with these overgrown

89
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,032
chopsticks?

90
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:47,335
You've got to be kidding!

-Oh, I know.

94
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,539
Are these guys controlling
them like puppets?

95
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,544
-I can't believe they could
control them all at once.

96
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,080
I don't care how good they are.

97
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:14,782
-Yes, I agree.

98
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,822
It's hard to believe they
have that much power.

99
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:18,422
Byakugan.

100
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,570
That explains it.

101
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:27,538
-Huh?

102
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:28,874
-Each of these
things is animated

103
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,313
and it's movements generated by
a seal on the back of its head.

104
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,951
-So that's not a puppet
master jutsu at all.

105
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,086
-No.

106
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,691
They have a basic set
of repetitive movements.

107
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,727
And they can't
anticipate our moves.

108
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,832
-So if we can remove those
seals, that should stop them.

109
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:46,838
-No sweat, piece of cake.

110
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:47,939
OK, blockhead.

111
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:50,444

Ha.

115
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,849
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

116
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:21,030
I gotcha!

117
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:30,914
TENTEN: Oh, heck, this is easy.

118
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:35,689
-Are you fool enough to think
that's the extent of our jutsu?

of these dummies

are controlled by a puppet

-How the heck did you
know we were way up here?

136
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,069
-When Sakura told me that
Guy Sensei was headed

137
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,739
to the land of
mountain streams, I

138
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:04,576
guessed at once he
would take this route

139
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:05,944
through the mountains.

140
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:08,582
But where is Guy Sensei now?

141
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:10,452
-Over there, inside that thing.

142
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,577
-What now?

143
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,845
-Are they running away?

144
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:36,931
-What the?

145
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,901
What the heck's going on?

146
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:56,198
Looks like some
kind of fortress.

147
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:59,003
-Let me handle this.

148
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:01,607
Guy Sensei is my
mentor and teacher.

149
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,145
I would gladly give
my life to save him.

150
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,750
-Bushy Brow, what about
that leg of yours?

151
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:08,152
It hasn't healed yet.

152
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:09,588
-I am going in.

-Wait, you can't just--

154
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:17,935
-You think you can stop me?

155
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,139
I warn you, I feel
very powerful today.

-Least we can do is help.

157
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:26,784
-I sense a weak
spot in the chakra

158
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,620
at the center of that structure.

159
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:29,522
Head for that.

160
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,257
-But be careful.

161
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,493
It could be a trap.

162
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,664
-Maybe so.

163
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:35,633
Very well then.

164
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:37,502

been lured into a trap.

169
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,843
Be that as it may, I
will see it through.

170
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:09,557
-Rokkaku, Jaco, leave
everything to me.

171
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:11,026
I will handle this.

172
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,195
-All right.

173
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,765
It's revenge we want.

174
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,736
Be sure you make the dog pay.

175
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,641
-Oh yes, he'll pay.

176
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:22,246
Wooden dummy, possess,
transfer, repossessed, jutsu.

177
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,633
[door slams]

178
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,304
-There are more of these
wooden dummies in here?

179
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:39,776
GENSHO: Your teacher has
filled your head with lies.

180
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,145
-Whose voice is that?

181
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,214
Yagura?

182
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,950
GENSHO: It's a lie
that passion and effort

183
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,119
can overcome anything.

184
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:48,124
A lie, and you're a
fool to believe it.

185
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,795
-Nobody called
Guy Sensei a liar.

186
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,533
I dare you to come out of
hiding and say that, you coward.

187
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,537
GENSHO: Why should
I, when I can easily

188
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:59,109
prove my point with these
wooden dummies I've created?

189
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:01,113
-I have vowed to
rescue Guy Sensei.

190
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,016
Neither you or
any wooden dummies

191
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,285
are going to change that.

192
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,555
GENSHO: You'd be funny
if you weren't so sad.

193
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,763
-Ahh!

194
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:12,700
That was the leaf hurricane.

195
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,569
Is it possible that
from the one time

196
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,675
I used it against Yagura he
was able to copy and master it

197
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,580
so quickly?

198
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:21,849
Very well.

199
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,785
Leaf Super Hurricane!

200
00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:31,966
Could Yagura really
be doing this?

201
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:35,071
If he has already developed his
offensive and defensive skills

202
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,945
to such a level, he truly
is a natural genius.

203
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:42,050
-There was extraordinary
force behind that kick.

204
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,256
This is not the young trainee
I watched in the practice saw.

205
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,959
In fact, there is
only one person

206
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,999
I can think of who could
unleash such power.

207
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,904
-They're fighting each other
without even knowing it.

208
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:56,074
How father would
have enjoyed this.

209
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:59,847
-Yes, a battle to the death
between teacher and student.

210
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,216
-It's perfect.

211
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,254
And even if they discover
the true identity

212
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,355
of their opponent--

213
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,227
-They have to fight on,
even against their will,

214
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:09,864
until one or the
other is defeated.

215
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:13,738
That is the secret of
my very special jutsu.

216
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,425
-Ahh!

217
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,883
-My leg cannot take
much more of this.

218
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,252
I have no choice.

219
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:24,790
There is only one
move left to me.

220
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:25,993
Forgive me, Guy Sensei.

221
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:28,864
I know I promised you,
but I must, for your sake.

222
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,982
-The Lotus.

223
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,185
Could it be the wooden
dummy is really Lee?

224
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,006
-Dancing Leaf Shadow!

225
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:04,859
-The Lotus hit back followed
by multiple severe Leaf

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,035
Magnificent.

228
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,971
In fact, too magnificent.

229
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:14,643
Only Guy Sensei is
capable of such a thing.

230
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:15,878
-Such ability.

231
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,649
If it were anyone
but me, that Lotus

232
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,821
would have ended the
match right there.

233
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,190
But end it must.

234
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,299
And it will end badly,
too, unless, of course.

235
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,801
It's the only chance we've got.

-That's tapping is Morse code.

238
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,794
What is he trying to say?

239
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,064
We have been tricked into--

240
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,766
-Committing
ourselves to a battle

241
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,173
that will only end when one
of us destroys the other.

242
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:55,113
-So it was Guy Sensei I
was fighting all this time.

243
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:58,085
-We can only free ourselves
if we attack each other

244
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,689
with such speed and force that
these wooden figures will not

245
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,259
be able to duplicate it.

246
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:06,232
-I fear it means I must lead
you to the very brink of death

247
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:06,866

251
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,225
-Will you forgive me
for breaking my word

252
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:23,695
and using that technique?

253
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:27,035
The most important
person in the world?

254
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:35,349
You mean to say that
I-- I am that person?

255
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:38,154
Do you mean it?

256
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,828
Oh Lee, of all the times,
why pick now to make me cry?

257
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:47,437
Listen Lee, I will never
forget the solemn vow I made.

258
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,078
-If by chance, Lee, you
should happen to die,

259
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,718
I will die at your side.

00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,087

261
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,725
Thank you, Guy Sensei.

it all the way to the end.

-Brother, what is it?

271
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,532
-They're too fast.

272
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,136
They're both moving too fast!

273
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:50,278
At this rate, the wooden dummies
will shatter into pieces.

I can't even hear them anymore.

-That's it.

Bring every ounce of

you sought, you

289
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,312
should have fought me like
a warrior, man to man.

290
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,089
Your father, though
out-numbered and the only one

291
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,227
of his squad still standing,
refused to surrender.

292
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:39,466
All he had left to fight with
was his kung fu and his honor.

293
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,377
Out of respect for
your father's courage,

294
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,049
I accepted his challenge and
met him in single combat.

295
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,020
And when the battle
was finally over,

296
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:53,324
he was content with
the outcome and said

297
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,127
only that he would
like to fight again.

298
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:07,515
Whether you believe what I
say or not, that's how it was.

00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:14,126
-Perhaps we misunderstood.

300
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,098
Perhaps he told us
we should fight Guy

301
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,105
not in the hopes of defeating
him, but to learn from him.

302
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:25,279
-So then we-- we've been
wrong all this time?

303
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,415
-Your father taught me
something very important

304
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:30,253
during our glorious battle.

305
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,658
He taught me that being
born with natural talent

306
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:34,394
is not the greatest gift.

307
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:37,567
The truly lucky ones are those
with an unwavering belief

308
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,373
in themselves and the passion to
keep striving to the very end.

That's why we brought
the stretcher.

-No, no, forget about me.

Take care of Yagura first.

There'll be plenty of time
to explain everything later.

KIBA: Sheesh, what makes
you think I would know?

329
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:06,657
NARUTO: I'm only asking.

330
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,093
NEJI: Quiet, you two.

331
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,395
TENTEN: Yeah, we're about to
get some important orders.

332
00:23:09,428 --> 00:23:10,162
NARUTO: OK.

333
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:10,998
TENTEN: Troji, come on.

334
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:12,000
Can't you eat later?

335
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:12,634
TROJI: Sure, when?

336
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:16,040
TENTEN: That's not the point!

337
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:17,208
NARUTO: I am so fired up!

338
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:18,677
TENTEN: You are so loud.

339
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,046
NEJI: I think everyone's here.

340
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:20,714
-All right then.

341
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,584
I'll explain the next mission.

342
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:23,719
NARUTO: Next time.

343
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:26,257
ALL: Crisis, the
Hidden Leaf 11 Gather!
