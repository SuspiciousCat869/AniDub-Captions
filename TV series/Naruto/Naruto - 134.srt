-So you're special, huh?

5
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:18,022
You won't be so special
when I'm finished with you.

[laughing]

00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,755
-There's no way
I'm going to lose.

00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,288
-Sasuke, you're a monster.

00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:14,655
-Remember if you
unleash it for too long,

10
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,688
the curse will start to
eat away at your body,

11
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:20,688
and once it spreads
through your body,

12
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,888
your former self will be
gone never again to return.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER): My body.

14
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:31,588
I guess I can't
waste any more time.

15
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,155
My left arm.

16
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:45,155
I can't feel it anymore.

17
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:55,422
SASUKE: That power of yours, by
using it, you're taking a risk,

18
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:55,922
aren't you?

19
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:01,122
Look around.

20
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:10,488
You know where we are?

21
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:16,688
It's called the Final
Valley, the perfect setting

22
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:19,055
for this fight.

23
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:20,955
Isn't it, Naruto?

24
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:31,455
Well?

25
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:33,755
Oh right, of course.

26
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:38,522
I said there'd be no
more talking, didn't I?

27
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:42,422
In that case, I guess
we're at the end,

28
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:47,622
the end of this fight and
all the fights up to now.

-Uh.

-Yeah!

35
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,555
-I'm doomed.

36
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,855
-And Sasuke Uchiha.

37
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,355
-Ahh!

38
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,955
-I'm doomed.

39
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:09,522
-Just make sure you don't
get in my way, loser.

40
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,422
-You!

41
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,788
-You said that there
were three of us.

42
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:17,588
That's what you said and
that's why Sakura and--

43
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:20,888
-We're all on this squad,
and we're all in it together.

44
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,388
-Yeah, that's right.

45
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:25,188
We gave our lunch to him,
because the three of us

46
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:25,855
are one.

47
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:26,322
-Hey.

48
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,822
-Yeah?

49
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:32,288
-You're not hurt,
are ya, little girl?

50
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:39,722
-Hey, kid.

51
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:42,188
You're not hurt, are ya?

52
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:45,088
-You're one of the ones
I want to fight the most.

53
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:47,155
-Huh?

54
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,922
Hey, Sasuke.

55
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:52,022
Don't lose.

56
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:55,555
Because I want to
fight you myself.

57
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,055
-I don't ever want to
have to see that again, my

58
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:02,488
trusted comrades falling
right in front of me.

59
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,488
NARUTO: Summoning jutsu.

60
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:15,088
Sakura, I swear
I'll protect you.

61
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:16,322
-What's so funny?

62
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:18,622
-I'm not laughing,
because it's funny.

63
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:21,955
I'm just psyched,
because I know that today

64
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,388
is the day when I
finally beat you.

65
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:25,822
-What did you say?

66
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:28,722
Don't talk nonsense,
you inept loser.

67
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:32,455
-I won't be such a loser
after I win today, will I?

68
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:33,755
-Let's just do this.

69
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,788
-Put on your
headband, and we will.

70
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,122
I'll wait.

71
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,022
-Not to worry.

72
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:39,522
I don't need that thing.

73
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:40,488
-Just do it.

74
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:43,455
Come on.

75
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:46,322
-There's no reason to put
it on, because you won't

76
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,655
be able to make a
scratch on my forehead.

77
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:49,755
-That's not the point.

78
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:50,588
Come on.

79
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,088
You know putting
your headband on

80
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:55,055
is a testament to fighting on
equal terms as a Leaf shinobi.

-Sasuke!

83
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,955
I'll win no matter what.

84
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,955
-I'm not finished with you yet.

85

-Stop it!

86
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,755

the end of it all.

-It's raining.

100
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:49,864
Will it wash away the scent?

101
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:50,697
-No problem.

102
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,064
We're already close enough.

103
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:52,697
This way.

104
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,164
-Am I too late?

105
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,130
-Naruto.

106
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:23,597
How did it come to this?

107
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:35,864
It's Sasuke's.

108
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:18,730
-I'm too late.

109
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:19,730
Forgive me.

110
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:33,164
Naruto, knowing you, you must
have put up quite a fight.

111
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:40,664
Sasuke.

112
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:07,364
-Now then, that's my boy.

113
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:22,330
-When we're alone
and no one's around,

114
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:24,297
the only one he
talks about is you.

115
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,764
-Because you and I
are flesh and blood.

116
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,164
I'm always going to
be there for you,

117
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:34,197
even if it's only as an
obstacle for you overcome,

118
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,297
even if you do hate me.

119
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:41,864
Like me, you may
be one of the few

120
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:43,397
who can use Mangekyo Sharingan.

121
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:48,597
But there is a catch.

122
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:58,064
Take the life of
your best friend.

123

-The Final Valley, huh?

124
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:16,364
To think that Sasuke and Naruto
would battle it out here.

125
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,164
It's pretty ironic,
don't you think?

126
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:24,664
-Yeah.

127
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:31,064
Look at that river.

128
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:36,597
The water just rages on
for eternity like this epic

129
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:44,030
never-ending battle, as
eternal as the two founders

130
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,497
of the Hidden Leaf
Village, forever

131
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,997
standing as these statues.

132
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:57,930
Naruto and Sasuke,
as long as they live,

133
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,430
the cycle will continue.

134
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,430
-Take the life of
your best friend.

135
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,597
You must kill him.

136
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,497
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): No, brother.

137
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,564
Just because you say it, doesn't
mean I'm going to listen.

138
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:57,030
I will get my hands
on that power, but not

139
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:59,264
the way you want me to.

140
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:04,064
I'm going to surpass you,
but I'll do it my way.

141
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:04,564
I will.

142
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:21,997
-The storm, it finally broke.

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,497
PAKKUN: Hm.

144
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:40,964
All that rain.

145
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:45,930
I won't be able to follow his
scent, but keeping Naruto alive

146
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:49,564
is more important
than finding Sasuke.

147
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:50,064
-Yeah.

148
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,930

interesting turn, haven't they?

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,897
-Indeed.

I'm so sorry, Sakura.

154
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,575
I made a once in
a lifetime promise

155
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,175
that I'd bring
Sasuke back to you.

156
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,809
But don't count me out yet.

157
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:17,309
I will live up to my
pledge, no matter what.

158
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,675
I told you I would do something.

159
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:22,009
And I never go back on
my word, because that's

160

my nindo, my ninja way.
