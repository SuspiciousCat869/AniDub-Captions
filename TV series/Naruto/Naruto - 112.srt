00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,184
As soon as a crack
appears, it repairs itself.

172
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,650
Same with the ground beneath it.

173
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,917
[dog whining]

174
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,950
-Hey.

175
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,684
I give us about 10
more minutes of this

176
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,084
before our chakras are
completely drained.

177
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,484
[buzzing]

178
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:48,917
NARUTO: No use!

179
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,084
I need all my energy to
focus for the Rasengan.

180
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:53,417
There's no way in here.

181
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,684
I've lost too much
chakra as it is.

182
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,150
[sighing] This stinks!

183
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,184
-Hey, out there!

184
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:33,784
Let me talk to your leader.

185
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,217
I've got a deal to propose.

186
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,050
What I'm thinking is that
you let us out of this thing,

187
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,850
and in return, we
let you keep Sasuke.

188
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:42,817
-Huh?

189
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,450
-But Shikarmaru,
what are you doing?

190
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:50,384
-My favorite part, when they
start pleading for their life.

191
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,384
No deal.

192
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,584
I've never let a
captive go before.

193
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,684
I'm not about to start now.

194
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:57,384
-Aw, come on.

195
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:01,150
Listen, how about you just let
me go, and keep the others?

196
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,150
All this fighting,
I'm tired of it.

197
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,084
It's really not my thing.

198
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,984
-You little-- if
you're selling us out,

199
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,784
I'm gonna wring your neck!

200
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:17,884
-Shut up, Kiba.

201
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,217
For once in your life.

202
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,017
-What did you say?

203
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,917
--[laughing] So
much for teamwork!

204
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,884
So you're really
the leader, huh?

205
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,584
What a fine example
you're setting

206
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:33,817
for the rest of your team.

207
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,884
You see a man's
true character when

208
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,217
he's pushed to
the edge of death.

209
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,450
But you're hardly a man
at all, certainly not

210
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:44,050
one who's worthy of leading
a team of ninja into battle.

211
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:54,384
-I saved the most important
thing of all for last.

212
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,050
-Sacrificing Sasuke and
the rest of your squad.

213
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:57,884
Ha!

214
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,584
So that's a Leaf Chunin acts.

215
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:04,784
-All the same, Sasuke's a ninja
belonging to the Hidden Leaf

216
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,184
Village.

217
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:09,484
He's a comrade, and I'll put my
life on the line to help him.

218
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,150
That's the way of our village.

219
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:14,817
-Did you really believe
I might let you out?

220
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,517
You deserve to die!

221
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,750
-That does it, Shikamaru,
you dirty little traitor,

222
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,317
let's take this outside,
just you and me!

223
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,850
-What do you mean,
take this outside?

224
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,584
How you gonna to
do that, you idiot?

225
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:26,050
We're trapped in here.

226
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,417
-[growling] What'd you call me?

227
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,417
-I called you an idiot, idiot!

228
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,850
-That's what I thought you said!

229
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,250
-That's enough!

230
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,950
Everybody just shut up!

231
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,650
-Huh?

232
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,150
-Choji?

233
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,484
-Hmm.

234
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:53,184
-What-- what's Shikamaru doing
now, meditating or something?

235
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,784
Why is he just squatting there?

236
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,184
[growling]

237
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,017
[munching]

238
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,817
-Augh!

239
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,117
You've got to be kidding me!

240
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,217
Is that all you
ever think about?

241
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,950
-That's Choji, for you.

242
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,450
Responds to a crisis
by stuffing his face.

243
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,750
He's a real big help.

244
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:10,717
-Forget this!

245
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,917
I'm gonna give
shadow clones a try.

246
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,050
-Don't bother.

247
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:16,717
That ninja has infused
this wall with chakra

248
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,484
so that it repairs itself.

249
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,750
Your shadow clones won't work.

250
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,650
You'll only deplete
your own chakra.

251
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:25,850
The fact is, multiple
attacks won't work.

252
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,950
Our only hope is
taijutsu strong enough

253
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,117
to destroy it in one blow.

254
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,484
-Well, Choji has taijutsu with
a knockout punch even stronger

255
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,450
than mine, but just look at him.

256
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:39,084
He's got other
things on his mind.

257
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:40,617
[crunching]

258
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:46,117
-Come on!

259
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,650
What are we gonna
do, just stand here?

260
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:54,650
Neji, I need you to
focus those eyes of yours

261
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:57,584
on the wall directly behind
you and directly behind Choji.

262
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,250
Do you think you have
enough chakra left for that?

263
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,250
-I think so.

264
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,150
-Hold on!

265
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:03,717
You're not going
to listen to him!

266
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,550
-Naruto!

267
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,450
You still don't get it, do you?

268
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,917
Don't you remember
what Shikamaru

269
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,184
said when we came
together as a team?

270
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:17,150
-I know I usually seem like a
pretty lazy guy, but not today.

271
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:20,850
Because now I'm responsible
for your lives too.

272
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,250
OK, Choji.

273
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:24,350
Try to keep your
voice down, will ya?

274
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:27,017
Kiba, are you up
for trying to put

275
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,484
another dent in the
wall behind Choji?

276
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,484
-Well, sure.

277
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:30,984
I guess.

278
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:34,950
Heh.

279
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:36,117
I don't know what's going
on, but I'm always up

280
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,184
for getting wild.

281
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,184
Hyah!

282
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:43,150
Pummeling Fang!

283
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,617
[thudding]

284
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,750
-Huh.

285
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:49,584
They've got a lot more
persistence than brains.

286
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:50,084
-Nngh.

287
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,984
[sizzling]

288
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,217
-Yes, I see it.

289
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,484
That's the spot!

290
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:16,984
-Hmm.

291
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,917
-Huh?

292
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,417
-OK, now, Neji, mark the
spot with your kunai knife,

293
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,517
will you?

294
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,984
Choji, are you ready, buddy?

295
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,350
-Shikamaru, I was born ready!

296
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:30,150
-Good.

297
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,584
Then let's get started.

298
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,184
-Wait, let's get what started?

299
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:37,617
-As I said a moment ago,
this wall surrounding us

300
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,150
has been infused with chakra.

301
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:43,650
However, the strength of
the chakra won't be uniform.

302
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:46,650
Some points in the wall
must be weaker than others.

303
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,517
Shikamaru was able
to figure that out.

304
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,084
-He did?

305
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:50,784
Really?

306
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:51,984
You coulda fooled me.

307
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,450
When the heck was this?

308
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:56,817
-He's been watching
and taking it in.

309
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,484
For example, when Kiba and
Akamaru attacked the wall,

310
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,684
while you were watching him,
he was studying the wall

311
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,350
and he observed that some
areas repaired themselves

312
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:07,584
more slowly than others.

313
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,850
[shing]

314
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,084
[thunk]

315
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,284
-That led him to suspect
that it was at those points

316
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,817
that the chakra was the weakest.

317
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,417
-Hmm.

318
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,850
-Still, he needed to be sure.

319
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,417
That's why he spoke to
our captor as he did.

320
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,750
It was a ruse to trick him
into giving away his position.

321
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:33,217
And it worked, confirming that
Shikamaru's suspicions were

322
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,284
right.

323
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,217
The band of chakra
running through the wall

324
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,717
was this thinnest and
weakest at the point

325
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,217
opposite his position.

326
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,950
That's about right, isn't it?

327
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,817
[chuckles]

328
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,184
KIBA: Ha.

329
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,850
And all the time we thought
he was selling us out.

330
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,784
I gotta hand it to him.

331
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,450
He not only fooled the enemy.

332
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,317
He had us going, too,

333
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,284
NARUTO: And here we thought
Choji was stuffing his face

334
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:03,450
again when he was really just
trying to replenish his chakra.

335
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:06,717
KIBA: These two guys, I guess
they haven't been working

336
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,584
as a team all this
time or nothin'.

337
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:11,384
-It's up to you, Choji.

338
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,284
-OK!

339
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:17,650
Expansion Jutsu!

340
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,850
All right, here we go!

341
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:28,250
[roaring] Human Boulder!

342
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:38,184
[blasting]

343
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:44,117
[roaring]

344
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,617
[thud]

345
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,117
-Nngh!

346
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,050
What!

347
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,217
-Well, Choji.

348
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,584
There's no other
way of saying it.

349
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,984
That was awesome!

350
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,450
[chuckles]

351
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,811
[theme music]

352
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,739
KIBA: Whoa, hang on, Choji!

353
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:03,706
Are you nuts?

354
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,472
NARUTO: Kiba's
right, that's crazy!

355
00:23:05,506 --> 00:23:06,772
NARUTO: Choji has a point.

356
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:09,439
If we waste too much time
here, we risk losing Sasuke.

357
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,239
NARUTO: Yeah, but--

358
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:10,939
CHOJI: Calm down!

359
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,106
I have a plan, OK?

360
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,706
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

361
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,372
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah!

362
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:15,106
MALE SPEAKER: What?

363
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:15,772
What are you thinking?

364
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:16,406
MALE SPEAKER: You sure?

365
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,406
CHOJI: Definitely!

366
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,139
It's time to unveil
my secret weapon!

367
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,106
NARUTO: Next time,
"Full-Throttle Power!

368
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,972
Choji Ablaze!"

369
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,439
CHOJI: Just leave it to me.

370
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:28,139
Chubbies rule!

371
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:31,672
