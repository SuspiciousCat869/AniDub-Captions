the boy maybe

I could make amends for
what we'd been doing.

Gantetsu look after the others.

I'll find him.

But don't you think you're
forgetting something?

After all, he saved these kids.

He saved Akio too.

Do you really expect me
to be grateful to him?

He's a murderer and a thief.

My guilt can't be so
