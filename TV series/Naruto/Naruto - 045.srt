1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,818
[music - Asian Kung Fu
Generation, "Far Away"]

2
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:53,448
-I will-- I will be Hokage.

3
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,185
I will.

4
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,420
-And how you gonna do that?

5
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:01,358
By lying flat on your face?

6
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,161
I got news for you.

7
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,329
I'm gonna be Hokage!

8
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:10,604
-Transform!

9
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:15,310
[laughter]

10
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,012
-You've been here
three years and can't

11
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,314
do a decent transformation?

12
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,819
-I don't have to
pretend to be Hokage.

13
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,221
You just wait!

14
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:26,191
Some day I'm gonna
be Hokage for real.

15
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:27,359
Then you'll be sorry!

16
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:32,733
-Yeah, right.

17
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:36,537
On what planet?

18
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,872
Come on.

19
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:40,943
Do you really believe a weakling
like you could be Hokage?

20
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,746
You must be weak in the head.

21
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:44,748
HINATA (VOICEOVER): No.

22
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:45,849
You're wrong, Kiba.

23
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:08,446
-Sorry, but-- you can
forget about being Hokage.

24
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,889
Because I'm the top
dog around here.

25
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:19,093
Surprise attack--
Naruto's secret weapon!

26
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:32,077
-You're kidding.

27
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,880
You're a real glutton for
punishment, aren't you?

28
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:39,787
OK.

29
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,489
It's your funeral.

30
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:44,159
I'm gonna make sure
you don't get up again.

31
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:46,361
Let's go, Akamaru!

32
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:49,366
-How many times are you
gonna use that move?

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,534
-Just once more!

34
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,200
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Man, they're fast.

35
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:20,774
-Fang Over Fang!

36
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,519
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The
same trick as before.

37
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:33,090
And it's working
just like before!

38
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:35,226
It's like fighting in the dark.

39
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,229
I've gotta find a way out.

40
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:37,829
Or else--

41
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,443
-Ha!

42
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,013
Looks like you've
run out of gas, kid.

43
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:52,215
-Yeah?

44
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:53,483
Bring it on, dog-breath.
'Cause no matter

45
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,218
how many clones of
yourself you make,

46
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,889
I'll still have enough
gas to beat you!

47
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,757
-Ha!

48
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,559
You always got a
snappy comeback.

49
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,261
Let's see you come
back from this!

50
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:02,996
Ready, Akamaru?

51
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,728
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Gotta
find a way to counterattack.

52
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,733
Problem is, I don't now
which one to attack!

53
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,736
Which one's the real Kiba?

54
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,538
I can't tell them apart!

55
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:40,911
-What's going on?

56
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,881
I can't see.

57
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,316
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Naruto.

58
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,923
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Wait a second.

59
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:50,726
That's it!

60
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,129
Transform!

61
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:00,938
-Here we go!

62
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:11,151
-Very clever.

63
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,019
-Huh?

64
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:12,553
-Wait.

65
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:13,254
You'll see.

66
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:21,131
-Whoa.

67
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:29,675
Perfect!

68
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:30,410
Good one, Naruto.

69
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:32,979
Brilliant!

70
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,749
-It's genius.

71
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:36,819
He's made himself
look like Kiba,

72
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,922
so now Kiba doesn't know
which one to go after.

73
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:43,961
He's got to be careful, because
he might be attacking Akamaru.

74
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:47,399
-And meanwhile, Naruto is
safe attacking either one.

75
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,200
Brilliant idea!

76
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,436
Woo-hoo!

77
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:53,340
-He's got him
completely stymied.

78
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:54,275
Ha!

79
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:55,843
-OK.

80
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,980
So I see you've gotten better
at the transformation jutsu.

81
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,451
But you forgot one little thing.

82
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:05,422
I admit, you look just like me,
and that threw me for a minute.

83
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,792
But I still know
which one is you.

84
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,962
You can't hide from me.

85
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:10,762
Wanna know why?

86
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,541
I can smell you, kid.

87
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,980
There's just no getting
past our sense of smell.

88
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:24,714
Tough luck.

89
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,752
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): By
concentrating his chakra

90
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:32,792
in his nose, Kiba can make
his sense of smell 1,000 times

91
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,960
more sensitive than average.

92
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:38,232
It's easy for him to distinguish
people by their scent.

93
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:41,869
-Game's over.

94
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,881
SHINO (VOICEOVER):
What happened?

95
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:54,020
Kiba's nose got them mixed up.

96
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,261
But how?

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,761
KIBA (VOICEOVER): No way.

98
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:01,495
It's impossible.

99
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,237
So it's you!

100
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,304
Messing with me!

101
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:16,181
What?

102
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,322
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Well, this is

103
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:25,494
coming from the original
class clown, after all.

104
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,128
KURENAI (VOICEOVER):
Kiba was fooled.

105
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,413
-Atta boy!

106
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,986
-That was just amazing!

107
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,249
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
I get it now.

108
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,083
Ha!

109
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,620
Way to use your head, Naruto.

110
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:14,925
When Kiba saw through his
disguise and sniffed him out--

111
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,161
he had the presence of
mind not to reappear

112
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:21,166
as himself but to transform
again, into Akamaru.

113
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,704
And that made Kiba forget
all about his sense of smell.

114
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,674
He believed what he saw.

115
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,542
And that's when he
lost his advantage.

116
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,779
-Who would have thought
the Naruto I used to know

117
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:32,148
could ever be that smart?

118
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:37,587
-Little squirt.

119
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:40,959
-The smart shinobi is careful
how he uses his jutsu.

120
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:43,662
Otherwise it's liable to
come back and bite him

121
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:44,496
on the butt, dummy!

122
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,336
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Hey, that's my line.

123
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,005
Sort of.

124
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,742
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Arguing with
this kid is a waste of energy.

125
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,211
I can't play his game.

126
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:56,546
Gotta keep calm.

127
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,450
Keep calm.

128
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:07,727
OK.

129
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,697
I still have the advantage.

130
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,499
I'm a lot faster than he is.

131
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:14,703
He can't keep up with me.

132
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:18,742
All I have to do is watch for
an opening, slip in behind,

133
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,646
and take him down with
my All Fours jutsu.

134
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,615
That's right.

135
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,150
No worries.

136
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:28,921
If I just keep my head there's
no way I lose this match.

137
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,323
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Careful, Naruto.

138
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,893
Your opponent has
calmed himself down.

139
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:35,063
So what's your next move?

140
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,272
-So, are you finally
getting serious, Kiba?

141
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,941
Good.

142
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:46,377
That means it's time to
unveil something special

143
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,646
I've been saving.

144
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,684
My super-secret killer move!

145
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,688
-Your what?

146
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,159
You gotta be kidding me.

147
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:57,993
-Huh?

148
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,561
Where'd he come up with that?

149
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,265
-You can leave it to Naruto
to have a trick up his sleeve.

150
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:03,533
Well done!

151
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:04,501
-Ha!

152
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,004
Super-secret killer move.

153
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,338
Get outta here.

154
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:07,805
It's a bluff!

155
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:08,774
-Yeah?

156
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:11,177
Well, try me and find out!

157
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,845
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Come on, Kiba.

158
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,582
Don't let this punk get to you.

159
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,085
Just stay calm.

160
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:18,587
Stay in the game.

161
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,255
-You ready?

162
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,457
-Whatever he's got
in mind, I'll just

163
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:25,028
make sure he doesn't
get a chance to try it!

164
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,644
Beast Mimicry-- All Fours jutsu!

165
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:48,325
Well, what are you waiting for?

166
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,465
-No, Naruto!

167
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:54,033
-Naruto!

168
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,251
-I knew this kid
couldn't hack it.

169
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:14,193
-On your feet, Naruto!

170
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,331
-He's coming at me so fast.

171
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,468
I don't have a chance
to build up my chakra.

172
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:24,939
-Hey, what's wrong?

173
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:26,508
Just gonna stand there?

174
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,819
-Man, he's fast.

175
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:35,954
-Too fast.

176
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,290
Naruto can't make
his hand signs.

177
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,757
SHIKAMARU: (VOICEOVER) Too fast.

178
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,059
Too strong.

179
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,229
Naruto's out of his
league against this guy.

180
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,670
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Naruto!

181
00:12:58,483 --> 00:12:59,419
-Take this!

182
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,830
-Take this!

183
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,188
I will be Hokage.

184
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:30,893
I will never lost to
you or anyone here.

185
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:32,294
-Dream on, kid.

186
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,764
How can you beat me when
you can't keep up with me?

187
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:55,124
Hey, kid!

188
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:56,292
Heads up!

189
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,697
-Naruto!

190
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,475
-You wanted me to get
serious, so I got serious.

191
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:19,489
You get it now?

192
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,426
You were just kidding yourself.

193
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,862
You never even had a chance.

194
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:24,462
Huh?

195
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,707
-I absolutely will not lose.

196
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:05,416
Guess that means
you're out of luck.

197
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:09,822
-I'll give him one thing.

198
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:11,524
The kid doesn't give up.

199
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:12,392
-Mm-hm.

200
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,395
-Naruto's like a bad cold.

201
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:17,065
Kiba just can't seem
to shake him off.

202
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,199
-Come on.

203
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:19,434
I don't care who
it is, I just wish

204
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:22,305
someone would win
this match already.

205
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,241
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Naruto.

206
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,809
Hang in there.

207
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,777
-Atta boy!

208
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,445
Look at him.

209
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:28,713
He's starting to crack.

210
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,148
You've got him right
where you want him.

211
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,651
-Now, Naruto!

212
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:32,385
Go for it!

213
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:43,032
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This
guy's gotta have a weak spot.

214
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:45,368
I just have to find it.

215
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,004
Hey, what are you waiting for?

216
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,439
You tired?

217
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:51,476
-You're a scrappy little
squirt, I'll give you that.

218
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,246
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
He's on his last legs.

219
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,382
This next one oughta do it.

220
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,617
-That's enough of this.

221
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:59,920
It's time to unveil
my new technique.

222
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:03,292
-Go for it!

223
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,261
Too late.

224
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:06,863
I got you now.

225
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:14,173
[fart]

226
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:22,917
[sniffing]

227
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,588
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Who said
Naruto had run out of gas?

228
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:28,925
The poor guy's jutsu
lead him right into it.

229
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,230
-And with his sense of smell
1,000 times more sensitive than

230
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,966
average--

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,735
-Oh, nasty!

232
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,104
Ugh!

233
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:39,940
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Was that
his new super-secret killer

234
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:40,808
move?

235
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:41,641
I wonder.

236
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:44,045
He always was unpredictable.

237
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,415
-Whatever works, Naruto!

238
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:49,484
You slowed him down, at least.

239
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,622
-I wish I could
say I planned it.

240
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:56,394
But anyway, the time has come
to unleash my new technique.

241
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:58,530
Shadow clone jutsu!

242
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,270
HINATA (VOICEOVER):
What's he going to do?

243
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,506
-You've kicked me around
pretty good so far.

244
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,908
Now it's payback time!

245
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,487
-Well?

246
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,819
-Uzumaki Barrage!

247
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,479
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

248
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,581
A new technique?

249
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,023
I'd say he picked that
up from watching Sasuke.

250
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,902
-Lion's Barrage!

251
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:21,271
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): At
least he changed the name.

252
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:22,005
Sort of.

253
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,270
-The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

254
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:47,506
-Woo-hoo!

255
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,376
-Yes, Naruto!

256
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,477
That's my teammate!

257
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,913
Way to go!

258
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,015
-Unbelievable.

259
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,318
Who would have thought
he could beat Kiba?

260
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,488
-A major upset.

261
00:18:58,521 --> 00:18:59,088
-Mm-hm.

262
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,274
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can feel it.

263
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:15,643
I'm getting stronger.

264
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,421
Ha!

265
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,989
It was nothing.

266
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,794
Piece of cake.

267
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,395
HINATA (VOICEOVER): He's coming.

268
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:31,997
What do I do?

269
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:32,999
What do I do?

270
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,977
-Na-- Naruto.

271
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:43,046
-Huh?

272
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,848
You say something?

273
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:45,670
Hinata?

274
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:52,090
-I-- thought-- maybe--

275
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:02,737
-Huh?

276
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,073
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): Hinata?

277
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,809
Well, well.

278
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:08,845
-Uh-- what's, uh-- this?

279
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,216
-It's a healing ointment.

280
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:11,917
-For me?

281
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,818
What for?

282
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:21,496
-Take it, Naruto.

283
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,463
Go ahead.

284
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:27,837
-Thanks, Hinata.

285
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,972
That's, uh-- real nice of you.

286
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,816
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): You have
nothing to be ashamed of, Kiba.

287
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:40,186
Who could have imagined he
would be such a strong opponent?

288
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,642
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Silly Hinata.

289
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,845
Not a care in the world.

290
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:09,358
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

291
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,881
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This Neji
has always gotten on my nerves.

292
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:45,384
Acting like he's so
superior to everybody,

293
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,619
like he's some kind of
royalty or something.

294
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:48,754
OK, Hinata.

295
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:50,991
It's time to take
him down a peg.

296
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,393
Come on, you can do it!

297
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,062
Show him that just
'cause you're quiet

298
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:56,498
and a nice person,
that doesn't mean you

299
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,434
can't knock his block off!

300
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:03,395
Next time-- "Byakugan
Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!"

301
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,928
My money's on Hinata.
