-So you're the one the Leaf
trotted out for me, huh?

00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,369
-Well look, I owe
you one, and there's

4
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,905
no way I'm letting a
girl show me up, OK?

00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,242
Still singing the same old
chauvinist tune as always,

aren't ya?

7
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:30,346
Gaara and Kankuro
are chasing down

8
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,848
the ones who have
our village girl.

9
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,750
You should go help them out.

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,386
-From what I hear,
they're each squaring off

11
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:40,623
in their own separate
flights right now.

12
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,358
-Good to know.

SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Darn it!

My shadow won't reach.

15
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,297
-We already have
help on the way here.

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,500
Two man squads are on route.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,502
-Came prepared, didn't your?

18
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:56,639
-It's a bit of a drag, but if
you're going to do something,

19
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,807
do it right.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,775
And this time around, there
won't be any casualties.

21
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,778
-Well, if one of your
comrades does go down,

22
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,613
try not to start bawling again.

00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,217
-Huh, are you going to hold
that over my head forever?

Guess that's what
girls do best, huh?

The Sand village

-Hm.

00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:24,645
Dogs will surprise you.

If you ever come
to their rescue,

36

piling on up here,

but my Dark Fang Blade should
be more than enough for the job.

You ready?

47
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,419
-Without all of
that chakra in it,

48
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,422
your sand is pretty
much useless Kid.

49
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:12,593
You could throw it
in my eyes, I guess.

50
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,260
Useless.

51

I can feel it, all that
chakra flowing into me.

You mean that whole
gorge is full of sand?

I thought he was
playing it safe.

They don't call him

-No, it's that blade of hers.

It's amplifying her chakra.

-So our whole strategy
depends on that sword, huh?

is our long-range fighter.

Inoue and I both
handle mid-range jutsu,

You're about to die,

I'll explain it later.

Now, are you going
to do it or not?

-Well, I guess I
could give it a shot.

-What gives?

The lines of this

We've taped into an underground
stream in the Earth below

Trust me.

However-- the fight's over.

00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,787
-The hero always saves the
day at the last moment.

167
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,422
-Damn right he does!

168
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,595
Sorry to keep you waiting Gaara.

169
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,163
-Naruto?

170
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,531
-You were there to
save our skin when

171
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,201
we were chasing
after Sasuke, right?

172
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:18,137
This is our chance to
return the favor for ya.

173
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,171
Now, go on, get moving.

174
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:20,506
We'll take care of this guy.

175
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,708
You've got a pupil who
needs saving, don't you?

176
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:33,085
-To think he could
press you this far.

177
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,053
SAKURA: Lee!

178
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:35,521
-Sakura!

179
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:36,422
-Go on.

180
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,290
Just leave Gaara
in my hands, OK?

181
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:40,159
You should be helping Naruto.

182
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,427
-(HAPPILY) Hey, Sakura!

183
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,741
-Absolutely.

184
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:48,100
All right then, allow me
to get the ball rolling.

185
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:49,235
-Be careful.

186
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:53,139
His armor can
absorb your chakra.

187
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,340
-He's right kid.

188
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,575
I'll suck up every bit of it.

189
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:02,615
-I see.

190
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,284
So we cannot rely on our
usual abilities, can we?

191
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,286
-Aw, who cares!

192
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:11,557
If you're out of chakra,
there's always guts.

193
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:12,525
-Right!

194
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,560
If there is a will,
there is a way.

195
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,636
KUJAKU (VOICEOVER): I was right.

196
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,439
The backup team hasn't
launched a single attack,

197
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:29,375
which means they have
no long-range jutsu.

198
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:32,578
I'll just have to keep
them at arm's length.

199
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:35,414
Now, relinquish your
flesh to the wind.

200
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,252
INOUE (VOICEOVER): All her
attention's on those two.

201
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,754
Now's my chance.

202
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,389
Mind Destruction jutsu!

203
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,092
SHIKAMARU: Inoue!

204
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:47,793
-What?

205
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:49,328
Are you kidding me?

206
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,729
You'll have to be a lot
faster than that sweetheart.

207
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,103
-Ha!

208
00:14:58,137 --> 00:14:59,505
Also predictable.

209
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:02,741
Keep trying, hon,
you'll never touch me.

210
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:03,676
-Ha!

211
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,211
We'll see about that.

212
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:07,580
-Inoue, you just stay put, OK?

213
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:11,684
-K.

214
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:15,821
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Shino,
Sakura, I'm counting on you.

215
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:23,295
-One of them is wounded
by the waterfall.

216
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:25,764
KIBA: Fang over Fang!

217
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,066

-(ANGRILY) What the--
What are you doing?

221
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:34,707
-What is this?

222
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,542
Are you three trying to mock me?

223
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,111
SUIKO (VOICEOVER): Once I've
sucked up all their chakra,

224
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:40,813
it'll be payback time.

225
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,820
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I
finished the contusion,

226
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,755
but his chakra
loss is staggering.

227
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,830
GAARA: Contact
from your friends?

228
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,665
SAKURA: Inoue is hurt?

229
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:00,432
-(URGENTLY) Go!

230
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:01,300
-Huh?

231
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,737
Yeah, but in your condition--

232
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,672
-I'll be perfectly fine.

233
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:07,740
Now, get going.

234
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:10,676
She needs you.

235
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,411
-Try not to overdo it.

236
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:13,412
-Got it.

237
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:20,419
-Hey, what are you
waiting around for?

238
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:22,688
You're comrades are in trouble.

239

-I have some time.

240
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:26,825
This'll be quick.

Where's the mutt?

Broken pieces from
the Black Ant.

Wait!

249
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,118
is it a signal?

00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,621
-Where going to try
to hit him again.

251
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:58,257
Back me up with the Crow.

252
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,092
You be ready too Choji.

253

-Right.

254
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,428
You got it.

KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Huh, bossing me around.

256
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:13,439
-Time for our counterattack.

257
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:14,440
-Forget it.

258
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,275
Your jutsu will never reach.

you never know until you try.

clear the water is,

to produce a shadow.

be waterlogged now

00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,996
Nations.

332
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:11,297
They'd been dabbling
in elicit research,

333
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:13,266
trying to create
an ultimate weapon.

334
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,601
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I see.

335
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:16,936
So the people of the village
caught on and evacuated.

336
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,271
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Exactly.

337
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,974
Kakashi, I want your team
over there immediately.

338
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,408
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Understood.

339
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:26,446
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
The Ultimate Weapon Reborn.
