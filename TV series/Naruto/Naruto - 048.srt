-Hm?

00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:49,029
-I have two pieces
of advice for you.

7
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:52,634
First of all, if you intend
to call yourself a shinobi,

8
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,670
stop that stupid
cheering of yours.

9
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:56,272
It's disgraceful.

10
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:00,377
And second, once a
failure, always a failure.

11
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,081
You can't change that.

That creepy guy from

tough if he took on Sasuke.

that Sand Village guy.

about this guy Neji.

I knew if I said I wanted
to be last, I would be next.

106
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,596
I simply applied
the principle which

107
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,966
states that sometimes the
surest way to hit something

108
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,169
is to stop trying to hit it.

109
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,705
It is a form of
reverse psychology.

was not going

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,482
Ha-ha!

115
00:06:57,515 --> 00:07:00,118

118
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,793
A piece of advice
before you began.

What are you thinking?

127
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:20,313
After all, you're not
going to have time

128
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,148
to read any notes during
the match, are you?

129
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:22,983
-Ah!

130
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:24,318
More good advice!

just figured that out

about the gourd?

133
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,425
SAKURA: I hope Lee
will be all right.

134
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,864
-Now, rock and roll!

135
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:34,465
-Yeeaahhhh!

136
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,916
I knew that sooner or later,
we would have to meet,

137
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,050
and I'm glad it is sooner.

138
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:54,526
KANKURO: I don't know
what kind of moves

139
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,996
that guy with the
dumb haircut has got,

140
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,901
but he'll never take Gaara
down, not in this lifetime.

141
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:03,271
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): He's
fast on his feet, all right,

142
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:07,043
but his kick isn't that great.

143
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:07,677
-Wrong.

144
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,147
-What?

145
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,848
-Aaiiiiii-yahh!

146
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,895
NARUTO: Lee's stronger
than you think.

147
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:21,829
You have no idea.

148
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,538
-Why are you in such a hurry?

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,382
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Be careful.

150
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,855
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
Stay on your toes, Lee.

151
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,165
-All right, then.

152
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,839
If you are both ready-- begin.

00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,273
-What is that?

159

-It's sand.

160
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:21,578
-That's an unusual jutsu.

161
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,348
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So that's
what he's got in that gourd!

162
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,583
SHINO (VOICEOVER): That--

163
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,327

166
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:46,712
GAARA: Sand Burial.

167
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,418
SHINO (VOICEOVER):
That nightmare.

168
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,621
Not again!

169
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,991
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): A
sand-manipulating jutsu, hm?

170
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,295
It will not be easy
getting through that.

171
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,263
But nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

172
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,643
Rrraahh!

173
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,414
Hunh!

174
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:12,981
Hah!

175
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:18,522
Aaaah!

176
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,117
-Whoa!

177
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,241
-Even as fast as he is, Lee
can't get anywhere close

178
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:33,075
to him.

179
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,043
-The sand!

180
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,478
He's using it as a shield.

181
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,813
-He's not doing it.

182
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,383
The sand is protecting
him of its own accord.

183
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,518
-Huh?

184
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,187
-It's almost like
a living thing.

185
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,726
It'll come to Gaara's defense
without his doing anything.

186
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:49,197
That's why Gaara's
never been injured.

187
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,367
No one can get at him.

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,137
No one's ever even
been able to touch him.

189
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:59,210
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): Aah!

190
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:00,512
How is he doing it?

191
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,648
He's not moving a muscle!

192
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,286
GAARA: Well, is that all?

193
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,654
-Huh?

194
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:11,260
-I hope you haven't
finished entertaining me.

195
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:15,933
We haven't had enough blood.

196
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,939
-Huaaah!

197
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,836
Aaaaahhh!

198
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,722
SAKURA: I don't get it!

199
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,791
He's only using taijutsu.

200
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,661
Can't he see that's
never going to work?

201
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:41,000
Why doesn't he get some
distance and use ninjutsu?

202
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,574
-Yes, that might be a good
idea-- that is, if we had any.

203
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:46,908
-Huh?

204
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:51,414
-Lee has no ninjutsu or
genjutsu skills at all.

205
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,216
-You're kidding!

206
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,816
-Yah!

207
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,517
Ah!

208
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:54,753
-Oh, that's nothing.

209
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,255
You should have
seen how hopeless

210
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,158
he was when I first met him.

211
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,894
No talent whatsoever.

212
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:01,562
-Really?

213
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,566
I can't believe it.

214
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,167
-Yaah!

215
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:14,513
[cries out]

216
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,483
-Aaah!

217
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:17,484
-Mm!

218
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,485
-Oh!

219
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,453
-It's over.

220
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,055
[chuckles quietly]

221
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,007
-Uh?

222
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,905
MIGHT GUY: A ninja who can do
neither ninjutsu or genjutsu

223
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:36,676
is certainly a rarity.

224
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,880
Lee has only his
taijutsu to rely on.

225
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:42,184
Some might consider
that a disadvantage.

226
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,359
But that's what
makes him a winner.

227
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,327
-Huh?

228
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,295
MIGHT GUY: All right, Lee.

229
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,231
Take 'em off.

230
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:56,203
-Uh, but Guy-sensei, you said
that was only as a last resort,

231
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:59,207
when the lives of very
important people were at stake.

232
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:00,576
-That's right, I did.

233
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:04,381
But this is an exception.

234
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,282
-Really?

235
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:05,883
Really?

236
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,292
-Huh?

237
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:12,925
Are those--

238
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,061
-How old-fashioned.

239
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,396
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Leg weights?

240
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,765
Basic training equipment.

241
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:18,533
-Totally cool!

242
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,234
-Totally dumb.

243
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,006
-Ah, that is better.

244
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,876
Now I will be able
to move freely.

245
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,778
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Come
on, you really think

246
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,947
you'll be able to get
through Gaara's defenses

247
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,385
just by dropping a couple
of pounds of weight?

248
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,688
[smash]

249
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,223
[gasp]

250
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,191
[gasp]

251
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:37,293
[gasp]

252
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:39,195
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Guy, you are too much.

253
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,669
-All right, now go!

254
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:45,837
-Yes, sir!

255
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,015
-Rrrraaahhh!

256
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,792
Aaaahhhh!

257
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,762
SAKURA: So close!

258
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:04,996
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): So fast.

259
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,332
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Amazing!

260
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:06,933
-Huh?

261
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,674
MIGHT GUY: I could
see that Lee had

262
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:16,045
no aptitude for
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

263
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,850
So he skipped that and focused
all of his time and energy

264
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,120
into developing his taijutsu.

265
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,758
That way we turned his
disadvantage into a blessing.

266
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,628
Now he doesn't need those
other things to win,

267
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:32,601
because he's transformed himself
into the world's greatest

268
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:35,472
taijutsu specialist.

269
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,073
-Haaah!

270
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,047
[all gasp]

271
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,451
[grunts]

272
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,822
-Hm.

273
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,824
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
I don't believe it.

274
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,827
Gaara's been hurt!

275
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,797
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Impossible!

276
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,164
-Whoa, that's scary.

277
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,002
And I thought he was
quick on his feet before!

278
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,839
He's been that fast
This this time?

279
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:03,109
-Yes, Lee!

280
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:07,215
Let the power of youth explode!

281
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:08,153
-Rrrright!

282
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:15,927
[squeaking skid]

283
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,894
ROCK LEE: Over here.

284
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,096
No, here!

285
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,838
-Good!

286
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,808
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
A direct hit.

287
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,178
-He's just too quick!

288
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,349
That sandstorm can't
keep up with him.

289
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,117
Lee, you nailed him!

290
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:35,286
-That's incredible!

291
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,957
-I've never seen
anyone that fast!

292
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,593
-Makes me dizzy just trying
to keep track of him!

293
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,977
KANKURO: Uh-oh.

294
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,880
-Yeah, uh-oh is right.

295
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,782
Your friend with
the eye makeup is

296
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,585
getting the stuffing
beaten out of him!

297
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:01,188
-That isn't what I was
talking about, kid.

298
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,478
-Huh?

299
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,872
What?

300
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,845
[jagged wheezing]

301
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,214
-What the heck?

302
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,950
What's going on with this guy?

303
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,685
His face is falling off!

304
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,822
-It's like a shell made of sand.

305
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,058
-Look, there's not
a mark on the guy.

306
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,094
-That is so weird!

307
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,103
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): He
encased himself in sand, huh?

308
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,473
Things must be bad.

309
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:44,080
I haven't seen that look on
his face for a long time.

310
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,381
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

311
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,117
I sensed him getting
more and more unstable

312
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,487
as the Chunin Exams progressed.

313
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,058
[jagged wheezing]

314
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,026
BAKI (VOICEOVER): As I
thought, his inner demon

315
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,495
has been awakened.

316
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:00,970
-I don't get it.

317
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:02,271
Is he made of sand, or what?

318
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,775
All those blows and
kicks Lee hit him with.

319
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,677
Did any of them get through?

320
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,879
-No.

321
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:09,815
It's like he's wearing
a suit of armor.

322
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:11,317
-A what?

323
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,920
KANKURO: Ordinarily, those
shifting clouds of sand

324
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:15,489
are enough to shield him.

325
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:18,426
But in the event the
shield is penetrated,

326
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,263
Gaara can also wear
the sand like armor

327
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,600
as a last line of defense.

328
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,002
-This guy's too much!

329
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,370
He's got armor now?

330
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,874
Does he have any weak spots?

331
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:29,909
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Huh.

332
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,212
If you only knew, kid.

333
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:37,185
Actually, that armor
is one big weak spot.

334
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:40,557
Unlike the sand shield,
the armor can be broken.

335
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,492
And then there's the
enormous amount of chakra

336
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:45,630
that Gaara has to use
to keep it in place.

337
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:47,499
That takes its toll.

338
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,335
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
That's proof that Gaara

339
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,171
is feeling the pressure.

340
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,976
He would never have resorted
to the armor otherwise.

341
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,412
This Lee is good,
no doubt about it.

342
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,282
But that's not the
same as winning.

343
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,319
It may not be as
easy as we thought,

344
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:04,055
but the outcome's a given.

345
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:07,026
Gaara can't lose.

346
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,828
-Well, is that all?

347
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:09,896
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): Aah!

348
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,398
My speed will not be enough.

349
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:15,737
He is impossible to get at
behind those sand defenses.

350
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,942
But maybe if I can get
him up off the ground

351
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,844
and away from the
sand, then hit him

352
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:23,482
hard from above with the Lotus--

353
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,658
-Hm!

354
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,259
-Hm.

355
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:44,443
Get ready.

356
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:52,722
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
That's right, Lee.

357
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:53,856
Good work.

358
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,458
That flimsy shield of
sand won't protect him

359
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:59,231
from your high-speed Lotus.

360
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,233
-What are you waiting for?

361
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,436
-OK, you asked for it.

362
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:04,375
Hyyyahh!

363
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,209
-He's not floating!

364
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,377
-Try this!

365
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:20,259
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): What an
incredible series of kicks!

366
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,827
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER):
Even an ordinary

367
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,299
Lotus puts an enormous strain
on the body, let alone this.

368
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,737
You've got to
finish him off, now!

369
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,139
-Yyaahhh!

370
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,140
-Hm?

371
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:31,741
-Aaahh!

372
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:41,088
-Unnh!

373
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,690
-Now take this!

374
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:46,661
Primary Lotus!

375
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,133
[thud]

376
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:50,734
[thud]

377
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:51,635
[thud]

378
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:52,636
[thud]

379
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:06,989
[panting]

380
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,035
It is over.

381
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:18,772
I got him!

382
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,674
-Right on!

383
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:21,342
-Amazing!

384
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,910
He really did it.

385
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:25,181
-No, I don't believe it.

386
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,649
-You did it!

387
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,252
Way to go, Lee!

388
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:31,356
-Is he-- that guy
isn't dead, is he?

389
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,301
[crack]

390
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,870
[gasp]

391
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:45,708
[hard sand crumbling]

392
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,409
-Huh?

393
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:49,881
[hard sand crumbling]

394
00:20:58,793 --> 00:20:59,538
-What?

395
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:08,187
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

396
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:38,209
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What now?

397
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:40,678
Lee's hit the wall, and things
are just getting started!

398
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:43,683
That's what happens when you
go crazy on the appetizers

399
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,220
and don't leave room
for the main course.

400
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,156
Better get it in
gear, Bushy Brow.

401
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,859
Otherwise, this guy's liable
to eat you for dessert!

402
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:56,255
Next time-- Lee's
Hidden Strength:

403
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:58,888
Forbidden Secret Jutsu.

404
00:22:58,921 --> 00:22:59,888
Uh-oh!

405
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,555
Things are not looking good!
