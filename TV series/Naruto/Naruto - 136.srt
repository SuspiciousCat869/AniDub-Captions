[theme music]

2
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,295
-Maybe this way.

3
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,628
-This Ichiraku ramen's
all the medicine

4
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:21,128
I need to get back on my feet.

5
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:24,462
Hit me with another
big bowl, would ya?

6
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:25,595
-Comin' right up.

7
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,095
NARUTO: I'm tellin'
ya, this stuff's

8
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:29,562
just what the doctor ordered!

9
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:30,562
[clearing throat]

10
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:36,528
-Huh?

11
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:38,495
-When you snuck out
of the hospital,

12
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:41,195
I had hoped I might at least
find you hard at work training.

13
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:46,095
-Hi there.

14
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,095
Hey, any of you guys hungryt?

15
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,395
This is ridiculous!

16
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:51,362
MIZUNE: Here you are.

17
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:53,262
That should cover his bill.

18
00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:53,795
-Thanks.

19
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:54,528
Come again.

20
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:55,195
NARUTO: Come on!

21
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,162
Cut it out!

22
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:57,562
This is so stupid!

23
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,262
I'm fine, really!

24
00:02:58,295 --> 00:02:59,195
I'm fine!

25
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:00,028
-You may think
you're all healed.

26
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,262
You may even look all healed.

27
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:02,962
But you're not all healed.

28
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:03,895
-Hold on a second here!

29
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:05,195
Who got injured, you or me?

30
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,895
I'm telling you
I feel all right!

31
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,662
And I'll never get stronger
if I don't get out and train!

32
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:10,695
-All in good time.

33
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:13,362
Just as soon as you're
completely healed.

34
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,695
-You don't understand.

35
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,362
I made a promise to Sakura.

36
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,062
How can I keep it if I'm in bed?

37
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:26,328
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
You're pathetic, Sakura.

38
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:29,662
This is all because of you.

39
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:36,328
Naruto-- this is a once
in a lifetime request.

40
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,528
Just bring him home.

41
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:40,628
Please bring Sasuke back to me.

42
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:47,528
I did everything I could.

43
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:52,928
I tried, but I couldn't stop
him from leaving the village.

44
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:57,362
At this point, there's only
one person who can stop him.

45
00:03:57,395 --> 00:04:00,295
Only one who can save him.

46
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:03,228
Naruto, it's all up to you.

47
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:12,995
Was that the best I could do?

48
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:15,095
Cry and beg?

49
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:17,028
I just gave up.

50
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:19,128
Put it all on Naruto.

51
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,895
And Naruto didn't flinch.

52
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,528
He risked everything to
try and bring Sasuke back.

53
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,395
He put his life on the line.

54
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:44,862
Now it's time I finally
did something for Sasuke.

55
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:50,395
Time I put my life on the line.

56
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,895
-You can save your strength.

57
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,562
That rope is woven
from virgin's hair,

58
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:03,562
and that knot's a shinobi
reverse butterfly.

59
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,428
You could struggle all
day and not get free.

60
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:07,595
-Oh, get real, will ya?

61
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,362
I don't have time to
lie around like this

62
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:10,695
is some kind of vacation.

63
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,895
I've gotta get out there and
get going and get training,

64
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,228
and get strong.

65
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:17,462
-The sooner you start behaving,
the sooner that'll happen.

66
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,095
So do what the medics tell you.

67
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:21,428
[knocking]

68
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,362
-Come in.

69
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:28,595
-Uh--

70
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,962
-Oh, hey, Sakura!

71
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,695
Don't worry, I
haven't forgotten.

72
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:33,562
If it was up to me I
wouldn't still be here,

73
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:34,928
but my hands are kind of tied.

74
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,262
-He's making a
remarkable recovery,

75
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:42,762
but he mustn't push himself.

76
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:45,528
-No, please, I keep
telling you, I'm all right!

77
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:46,162
-Lie down.

78
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:46,962
You need to rest.

79
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,228
[giggle]

80
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,095
-Oh, well.

81
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,595
OK, so we'll have to
wait a little longer.

82
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:08,095
But I'm still gonna keep
my promise, no matter what.

83
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,162
-No, Naruto.

84
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,562
It's OK.

85
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:12,995
-Huh?

86
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:15,895
-Up 'til now, all I've
done is rely on you.

87
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:17,928
I see now that was a mistake.

88
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,562
-I don't get it, Sakura.

89
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,195
Are you mad at me, or something?

90
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,828
-No, far from it.

91
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,195
In fact, just seeing you has
made more than I was before.

92
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:26,695
-Huh?

93
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:45,562
-It's time I started
carrying my weight.

94
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,828
-Oh, Sakura.

95
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:06,428
JIRAIYA: So, I
hear you snuck out.

96
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:08,862
You wanna start
training that bad, huh?

97
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,228
-When did you get here?

98
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:11,928
Heyt!

99
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:13,062
Pervy sage, that's mine!

100
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:14,195
-Thatta boy.

101
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,628
You're recovering nicely.

102
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:19,095
In fact, we could start
training any time now.

103
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,028
-Hey, uh, about my training?

104
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:24,662
I was wondering, you think maybe
we could hold off for a while?

105
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,028
-Huh?

106
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,262
-I mean, believe me, it isn't
like I don't want to train.

107
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:30,262
But I just remembered
that I've got a few odds

108
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:32,295
and ends to take care of first.

109
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,128
you know?

110
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:34,628
-Hm.

111
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,228
A few odds and ends, huh?

112
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,162
-Please.

113
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,228
Just for a little while?

114
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,549
-I know you're there.

115
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,649
-Oh, uh, I wasn't
sure if you were busy.

116
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,524
-Enough with the
peeping tom stuff.

117
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,724
You've got to stop trying
to sneak peeks at women.

118
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,124
It's a problem--

119
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,724
-If I wanted to sneak a peek,
it wouldn't be at an old lady.

120
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,391
-Excuse me?

121
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:15,524
-No, wait!

122
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,491
That didn't come
out quite right.

123
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,691
But anyway, this isn't
a personal visit.

124
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:24,357
I'm here to make a request
of you as the Hokage.

125
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,757
-Hm?

126
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,924
Well, let's hear it.

127
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,024
-It's time I started
carrying my weight.

128
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,391
-I wonder-- could
she be thinking of--

129
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,391
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It may be
the last time I ever see it.

130
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:39,857
NARUTO: Sakura.

131
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:44,291
-How did you know?

132
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,257
I know what you're thinking.

133
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,824
That I'm being foolish.

134
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:57,924
That I haven't a chance of
rescuing Sasuke on my own.

135
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:01,657
But I-- I couldn't live
with myself if I didn't try.

136
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,824
All this time, I've let
others do everything.

137
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:07,757
And I've been
nothing but a burden.

138
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,457
I haven't done one thing well.

139
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:11,091
Not a single thing.

140
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,791
Don't try and stop me.

141
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,324
-Who says I want to?

142
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:17,557
You do what you gotta do.

143
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:19,224
I'm fine with that.

144
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:23,091
As long as you don't
mind me tagging along!

145
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,357
-No, it's just--

146
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,291
-There really should
be three in a squad.

147
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:30,657
But we can pretend
there are three of us.

148
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,157
Right?

149
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:34,924
-Right.

150
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:40,391
-Hello, you two.

151
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:41,791
-Pervy sage, what the heck?

152
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,257
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
So that's Jiraiya.

153
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,157
One of the legendary Sannin.

154
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,957
-Of course, you two know
what will happen to you

155
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,091
if you cross the border
of the Leaf Village

156
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:56,257
without permission.

157
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,857
It means imprisonment,
and you'll

158
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,957
be branded forever
as rogue ninja.

159
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:04,091
-If you're here to stop
us, you can forget it.

160
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:05,591
-Quite the contrary.

161
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,157
-Huh?

162
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,824
-In fact, you've been given a
mission by Lady Hokage herself.

163
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:14,524
It's rumored that the Sound
ninja may be holding Sasuke

164
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,057
in the Land of Rice
Paddies, and you're

165
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,624
to go there and investigate.

166
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:19,991
[gasp]

167
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,691
-But this requires a
squad of three people.

168
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,124
So starting now, you two
will be serving under me.

169
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,491
Any problem with that?

170
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,891
They're fools, but
they're determined fools.

171
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:44,024
They'll go anyway.

172
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,657
There's nothing we can
say that will stop them.

173
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:52,224
The result will be that we'll
lose the services of two

174
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:55,657
of our most valuable Genin.

175
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,957
You can't let it happen!

176
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:00,224
You can save them by giving
them an official mission

177
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:02,157
to investigate the Village
Hidden in the Sound.

178
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:07,691
-Do I have any choice?

179
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,591
But only on one condition.

180
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,457
Make sure that both of
them get back alive.

181
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:16,557
Understood?

182
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:17,557
-Don't worry.

183
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,624
They will, even if
it means I don't.

184
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,724
TSUANDE (VOICEOVER):
Maybe I'm the fool.

185
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,291
It's a risky mission, even
with Jiraiya tagging along.

186
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,024
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

187
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,557
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
The Land of Rice Paddies

188
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:08,657
that holds within it
the Sound Village.

189
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:12,724
We're in Orochimaru's territory
now, so be on your guard.

190
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,516
-I've gotta say, so far
this is kind of a letdown.

191
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,950
I would've thought at least
one of Orochimaru's goons

192
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,716
would have met us by now.

193
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,383
-This isn't what I
expected it to be like.

194
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,316
I never thought
the Sound Village

195
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,983
would be so pretty and peaceful.

196
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:35,283
-Well, it's not.

197
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,583
Technically, we're still in
the Land of Rice Paddies.

198
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,450
We haven't reached
the Sound Village yet.

199
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,950
-So what is this place?

200
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:43,250
-A small land, nothing special.

201
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:46,916
But its ruler was one of those
fools always seeking more.

202
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,283
More power, more
glory, more weapons--

203
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:51,483
and more of his
neighbors' lands.

204
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:54,150
This drew Orochimaru
like a bee to honey,

205
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,616
and he poured sweet words
into the fool's ear,

206
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,716
making him all
sorts of promises.

207
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,016
Of course, Orochimaru
had no intention

208
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,783
of making the fool any stronger.

209
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:06,483
He only seeks to make
himself stronger in order

210
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:07,983
to achieve his revenge.

211
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,383
You may not see any visible
signs of his presence

212
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,750
in this land, but
Orochimaru is here.

213
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:15,116
-So, what now, Pervy Sage?

214
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,450
-Will you please
stop calling me that?

215
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,750
-That's right.

216
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,283
He's one of the
Legendary Sannin.

217
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,883
Show some respect.

218
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,850
-Trust me.

219
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,450
When you get to
know him, you'll see

220
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:25,983
he's just a lazy old pervert.

221
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:26,850
That's all.

222
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,716
-What did he just say?

223
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,250
-Come on, let's get to it.

224
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:33,216
So, where is the Hidden
Sound Village, anyway?

225
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,316
-I don't know.

226
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,083
Bears the heck out of me.

227
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,716
That's the main reason we've
been sent on this mission.

228
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,783
To find it.

229
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:41,516
-Oh, yeah.

230
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,850
I see your point.

231
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,950
-Well then, how are
we going to find it?

232
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:49,250
-First we gather information
by finding the nearest town.

233
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:51,083
Every land has a
town where people

234
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:53,516
gather for rest and recreation.

235
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,183
-Uh-oh.

236
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,016
What did I tell ya?

237
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,283
He's up to his old tricks again.

238
00:14:57,316 --> 00:14:59,683
Sooner or later, every
mission's about the ladies.

239
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,750
-There's nothing like a
town full of pretty girls

240
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:03,716
to take a man's mind
off his troubles.

241
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,050
So the first thing to do is
to go find ourselves a town!

242
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,883
-Well, it's a town.

243
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,550
But not much of one.

244
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,783
-There's nobody here.

245
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:23,150
It's been abandoned.

246
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:25,350
-Oh, there's people
here, all right.

247
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,916
Can't you smell
all that perfume?

248
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:32,316
OK, kid.

249
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,183
Hand it over.

250
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:33,950
-What?

251
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,683
-You know how it works.

252
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:38,216
Gathering information
costs money.

253
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,216
-So that's it.

254
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,616
You're after Gama again.

255
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:46,816
-This is it?

256
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,416
This is all you got?

257
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,316
No way.

258
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,150
Cough up the rest.

259
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:53,083
Oh, yeah?

260
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:54,750
Trying to hold out on me, huh?

261
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,916
1, 2, 3.

262
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,916
Aw, you're kidding.

263
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,150
This is really all you got?

264
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:03,816
-Yeah!

265
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,616
You cleaned me otu!

266
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,850
That's it!

267
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:06,883
SAKURA: Here's some more.

268
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,916
-Huh?

269
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,450
-It's not a whole lot,
but if it'll help.

270
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:11,150
-Gah!

271
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,216
Sakura, keep your money!

272
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,283
You don't have to
give it to him!

273
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:15,716
-I want to pay my share.

274
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,416
It's for the good of
the mission, right?

275
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,616
-Oh, absolutely.

276
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,050
Mission, right, yeah, right.

277
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,050
You two stay out of this.

278
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,516
Go around the town and wait
for me on the other side.

279
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,150
-Huh?

280
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:29,516
What the heck for?

281
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,616
-It's too dangerous
where I'm going.

282
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,450
This is a job for grown ups.

283
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,683
Ah-ha.

284
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,516
That perfume is
coming from in here.

285
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:11,883
-Welcome, stranger.

286
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,183
-Get a load of this fool
with the crazy hair.

287
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:17,050
-Well, they saw a fool and
his money are soon parted.

288
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:23,250
-Food and drink!

289
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:24,883
I'm in the mood for some fun.

290
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,283
Ha ha ha ha ha!

291
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,116
-It's always the same.

292
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,116
You're wasting your money
by giving it to him.

293
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,383
All that about buying
information's a crock.

294
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,383
He just wants to
have a good time.

295
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,150
-What do you mean, a good time?

296
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:42,483
-Oh, well, you know.

297
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,916
What grown ups do when
they-- actually, I'm

298
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,783
not sure what he does, exactly.

299
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,616
-Whatever.

300
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,783
It doesn't matter.

301
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,083
I had to try and help.

302
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,650
I'm tired of being the only
one who never does anything.

303
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:54,650
-Hm?

304
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:56,583
Sakura, what are
you talking about?

305
00:17:56,616 --> 00:18:00,150
It's only because of you that
we're even on this mission!

306
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:02,950
It it weren't for you, I'd still
be tied to that stupid hospital

307
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:03,450
bed.

308
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,716
JIRAIYA: What are you
doing in a place like this?

309
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,883
Oh, not that I'm complaining.

310
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,416
A pretty face is a
welcome sight anywhere!

311
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,816
-Why don't you come in the
back and we'll show you?

312
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,183
-Yeah, let's go some place where
we can get more comfortable.

313
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,750
-Oh, well, I uh--

314
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:23,416
-First thing's first.

315
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,416
There's the little matter
of settling your bill.

316
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,550
-That's mine?

317
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,550
You sure you don't have
too many zeroes there?

318
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,783
Say, this wouldn't be some
kinda rip off joint, would it?

319
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:32,650
-Ha ha.

320
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:33,950
That's a very funny joke.

321
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,016
-Pay up, old man.

322
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,916
Everything you've got
if you want to live.

323
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,550
-Guess the joke's on me.

324
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,216
-Boy, it's been a long time.

325
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,883
What could be keeping him?

326
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,816
-Who knows?

327
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,116
But I'm getting
tired of waiting.

[rustling]

329
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,216
-Watch out!

330
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,016
-Who's in there?

331
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,416
Start talking, buddy.

332
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,450
Who are you?

333
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:37,216
Another one of
Orochimaru's hitmen?

334
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,616
-Did I get it wrong?

335
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,816
-To get that close
to us, he must've

336
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,550
somehow cloaked his presence.

337
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,950
-Well, he's not getting away!

338
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:48,616
-Wait!

339
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,950
Don't move, Naruto!

340
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,750
-What do you mean, don't move?

341
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:52,683
-Spikes, at your feet!

342
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:56,650
JIRAIYA: Naruto!

343
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:57,316
-What is it now?

344
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,250
[shouting]

345
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,716
-What in the world
is that all about?

346
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,116
-Uh, Pervy Sage!

347
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,683
What have you been up to now?

348
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:21,950
-I'll tell you about it later.

349
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,516
Right now, let's
just get out of here!

350
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,550
-Who are those guys?

351
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,850
-Maybe they're friends
of that other one!

352
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,883
-Well, if they're more
of Orochimaru's gang,

353
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,416
I'll hit them with my
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

354
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,483
JIRAIYA: No!

355
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:33,716
Don't use jutsu on
them, whatever you do!

356
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,950
They're nothing!

357
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,883
Just friends of some wicked
women I met in a tavern!

358
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,816
-You were in a bar?

359
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,816
-Skip it!

360
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,750
The main thing is,
this was supposed

361
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,116
to be a secret mission!

362
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,850
So we can't blow our cover by
using our ninja art on them!

363
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:49,916
Just run!

364
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,283
-The bags!

365
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,816
You're doing a great job of
keeping our secret mission

366
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,716
a secret, Pervy Sage!

367
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,683
-Let's go!

368
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,550
Less talk and more action!

369
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,183
Run, run!

370
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,350
-This is terrible.

371
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:01,550
What have I got myself into?

372
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,050
We're never gonna
find Sasuke this way!

374
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,638
-This town looks even
worse than the last one.

375
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:05,271
You two wait here
while I check it out.

376
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:06,671
-Oh not again.

377
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,005
JIRAIYA: It's far too dangerous.

378
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,371
It's no place for kids.

379
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,138
-Kids?

380
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:11,071
Now wait a second.

381
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,271
JIRAIYA: No, no.

382
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:13,771
I promised I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

383
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:16,271
If there's going to be any
risk, I'm the one to face it,

384
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,438
understood?

385
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,371
NARUTO: Yeah, yeah,
trying to sound all noble.

386
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,671
I know what you're up to.

387
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,905
The only risk we face is you
making a fool of yourself

388
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,705
again!

389
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,038
Next time, a Town of Outlaws!

390
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,705
The Shadow of the Fuma Clan!
