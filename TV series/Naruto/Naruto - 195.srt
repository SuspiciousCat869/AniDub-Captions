-Go on, Grandma Tsunade.

00:01:58,755 --> 00:01:59,389
Don't worry.

7
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,893
You can tell me.

00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,362
-Hm.

9
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:06,471
-You know, I have been feeling
kind of out of it lately.

10
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,177
I've been messing up
a lot in my training.

11
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,384
I knew something was wrong
when I couldn't get down

00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:15,323
more than five bowls
of Ichiraku ramen.

13
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:18,898
I've got some kind of awful
incurable disease, don't I?

00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:20,368
Go on, let me know the worst.

00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:23,675
You're fine.

Hey!

That's Bushy Brow's

-He's overdue for
a full examination.

23
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,761
He's been avoiding it.

-But-- what about, uh--

25
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,572

00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,617
Oh, by the way, have you
seen Bushy Brow around?

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,857
-No, but I'm pretty sure
where you can find him.

This is where he
usually is these days.

And after those
injuries, we thought

51
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,574
he'd be finished as a ninja.

I am all right.

you skipped your physical exam.

00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,484
It must have slipped my mind.

I have been feeling
so much better lately.

-What you need is more rest.

68
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,618
That means no more training.

There's cumulative damage

You're forgetting
you were injured

00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:10,872
so badly that your days as a
ninja might have been over.

And rule number one is to
never forget your goal.

00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:27,006
I must work to be the
best ninja I can be.

no hidden lotus.

have been grim.

Very grim from the looks of it.

-I heard the results
of your exam.

105
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,703
You have permission to
keep training, right?

106
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,007
-Yes, sir, but they
told me no lotus.

107
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,920
-I recall a day you were crying.

108
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:36,522
-Huh?

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,000
-You worked hard, Lee.

There's no doubt in my mind
the surgery will be a success.

[gasping]

112

You have the power to
shape your own destiny.

113
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:53,558
And on the 1 in 1,000-- no, 1
in a million chance something

114
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:58,836
should happen to go wrong, I
will die right along with you.

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,686
Since the day I
met you, my nindo

116
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,824
has been to train you
to become the most

00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,764
splendid ninja possible.

118
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:12,699
That's a promise.

119
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,147
You trusted me then, and
your surgery was successful.

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,884
You must trust me now.

If you must forsake
the hidden lotus,

123
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,497
then you'll just have to
work that much harder.

124
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,938
There is nothing you can't
accomplish through hard work.

with your dedication.

-We've laid off
training for too long.

Let's begin at once.

131
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,908
To the practice
hall on the double!

-Coming, Sensei.

ten seconds, it's 500 push-ups.

00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,204
LEE: Right!

135
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,740
I was foolish to think I
could make it in ten seconds.

-It's all good.

138
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,248
A little exercise
won't hurt you.

00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,985
-500.

Who is that?

147
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:42,291
GUY: That's Yagura.

148
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,530
He's been here for a week.

149
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,267
A friend of mine
asked me to determine

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,973
whether he has the
makings of a ninja.

151
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:52,714
-His name is Yagura?

152
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,184
He is quite good.

153
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,119
-Yeah.

154
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,056
He has the makings, all right.

155
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,034
He takes everything I teach him
and absorbs it like a sponge.

-I've heard your skills
are truly remarkable.

Guy Sensei told
me all about you.

-Huh?

-I'd be grateful if you'd let
your prize pupil train with me.

167
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,010
-Very well.

168
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:22,979
Begin!

00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:23,914
-Huh?

170
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:25,317
Guy Sensei!

171
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,789
-Well, you wanted to
train, didn't you, Lee?

172
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,927
What a perfect way to
begin by warming up

173
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,664
with your junior partner?

174
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,933
-I guess.

175
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,670
GUY: Now, remember,
he's only a rookie.

176
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:36,174
So try not to hurt him.

177
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,744
LEE: All right.

178
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,347
NARUTO: What's Bushy
Brow doing working out

179
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:40,783
in the training hall?

180
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,087
I thought his
condition was grim.

181
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,589
Isn't that what you said?

182
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,124
TENTEN: Yeah.

183
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:44,892
Grim.

184
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,197
Very grim.

185
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:50,237
[gasping]

186
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,809
-I'm only just a
novice, and I'm honored

187
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,279
that you're willing to teach me.

188
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:54,947
-Oh.

189
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,083
Not at all.

190
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,221
I hope you will bear with me.

191
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:58,889
-Huh?

192
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,693
[guy laughing]

00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,363
GUY: All right, you two.

194
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,769
I want you to attack your
opponent with everything

195
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,973
you've got, but
always with respect.

196
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,810
And through the
power of youth, you

197
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,681
lay the foundations
of friendship.

198
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,186
Now then, fight!

00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,658
-(VOICEOVER) He is fast.

200
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,097
-I want you to show me
every secret technique

201
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,068
that you've ever
learned from Might Guy.

00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:25,647
LEE (VOICEOVER): Such power.

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,051
[yelling]

206
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,396
These are not the
blows of a rookie.

207
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,038
I cannot take much more.

208
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:40,412
Leaf hurricane!

209
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:44,420
-(VOICEOVER) The attack from
above disguises the attack from

210
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,023
below.

-Incredible.

214
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,403
He defeated the leaf hurricane.

That's enough!

219
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,820
Lee, are you all right?

-Bushy Brow, you OK?

223
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,165
What happened?

224
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,802
What was that?

225
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:07,837
-It was a cross-block.

226
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:16,021
Capturing an opponent's kick
between the knee and elbow,

227
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:17,057
crushing the bone.

228
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,896
It requires perfect timing.

229
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,468
Where in the world did you
learn that move, Yagura?

230
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,105
-I didn't mean to.

231
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,845
It was only a reflex
reaction, that's all.

232
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:28,080
I'm so sorry, Lee.

233
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,221
Are you all right?

[gasping]

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,393
GUY: If Lee hadn't been
wearing his ankle weights,

236
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,332
the bone would have
been shattered.

237
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,267
[groaning]

238
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,837
-Good move, Yagura.

239
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,408
Shall we continue
our training session?

240
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:42,979
-That's enough for today.

241
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,251
I want the medics to take
a look at that ankle.

242
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:46,419
-I am fine, Sensei.

[groaning]

00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:49,158
-You got to be crazy
even trying this!

245
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:51,497
Didn't the hospital tell you
you're condition is grim?

246
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,499
Very grim!

247
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,468
-Huh?

248
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,971
-What do you mean grim?

249
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,510
-Well, I mean--
that's what they said.

250
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,779
Right, Tenten?

251
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:00,049
-Not in those words exactly.

252
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:00,984
NARUTO: Well,
something like that!

253
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:01,886
-(VOICEOVER) Even
wearing weights,

254
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,088
he was able to move that fast.

255
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,327
GUY: (LOUDLY) Where
did grim come from?

256
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,018
-Well, fortunately,
the bone's all right

257
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:17,486
-Thank you.

-So, how soon can
I start training?

00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:28,076
[gasping]

00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:28,911
-Training?

263
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,913
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,783
You're going to
rest, and that's all.

265
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,487
You're lucky there
wasn't permanent damage

266
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,324
to your Achilles tendon.

267
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,228
[sighing]

268
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:44,176
NARUTO: Why'd you have to
say his condition was grim?

269
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:45,380
[slurping]

270
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,087
You made me think he was,
like, dying or something.

271
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:49,555
-Huh?

272
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,025
TENTEN: OK, OK.

273
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,196
But he looked so gloomy when
he came out of the hospital.

274
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,365
What was I supposed to think?

275
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,806
I just assumed.

276
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,543
-No wonder he's feeling down.

277
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:02,984
Having to coach some trainee
who's not even in the Academy.

278
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,256
-Lee's coaching a trainee?

279
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,425
-That's right.

280
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,930
Some new guy who's only
been training for a week.

281
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:09,965
-He's good.

282
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,134
You should have seen
him do this move.

283
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:13,506
Uh, what was it called?

284
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:14,208
The uh--

285
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,112
-The cross-block.

286
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:19,018
And he pulled it off without
even thinking about it.

287
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,457
It's no wonder Lee's
acting so depressed.

288
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,127
-If Lee were the
type to let something

289
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,367
like that get him down, he
would have quit a long time ago.

290
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:27,403
-Huh?

291
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,107
-All his time at
the Academy, he's

292
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,844
been told he doesn't
have enough talent

293
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:34,118
to ever master
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

294
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:37,558
If I were in his place, I would
have given up long before now.

295
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:41,299
But hard work and perseverance
can mean more than raw talent.

296
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,337
I honestly believe
that if he can just

297
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,477
recover from his injuries,
Lee may surpass us all.

298
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,346
TENTEN: It's true.

299
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,148
NARUTO: Yeah.

300
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,517
TENTEN: But still,

301
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,987
[gasping]

302
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,057
If he pushes too hard, he
could suffer permanent damage.

303
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:55,096
And no amount of perseverance
will help him then.

304
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,601
-(ANGRILY) Why do you have to
be so negative all the time?

305
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,137
TENTEN: OK, OK, I'm just saying.

306
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,374
NARUTO: Well, cut
it out, will you?

307
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:02,545
Man, it's like you're the
voice of doom or something.

308
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:03,380
-Permanent damage?

309
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,217
TENTEN: OK, sorry.

310
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,222
I know as much as
anyone, we have a lot

311
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,883
to be grateful to him for.

312
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:09,416
-Huh?

313
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,086
Grateful?

314
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,592
-Yeah, very grateful.

315
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,995
GUY: All right.

316
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,268
Today I'm going to teach
you about self-rule.

317
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,237
-You're what?

318
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,440
-You're teaching us self-rule?

319
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,941
-Yes!

320
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:21,442
Yes!

321
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:22,010
Me first, Sensei!

322
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:22,743
Me first!

323
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:23,478
Whatever it is, I'm
ready to learn it.

324
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:24,147
[laughing]

325
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,182
Teach me, Sensei!

326
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,886
-As you go through
life, you'll find

327
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,924
that the world is
governed by many rules.

328
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,028
But the most important
rules are the ones

329
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,132
that come from
within-- the rules

330
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,903
that you place on yourself.

331
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:36,173
GUY: Right.

332
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,244
Today, I'm going to give you
all a very special reward.

333
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,914
-A reward?

334
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:40,983
-Like what?

335
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:41,684

338
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,497
Your own set of tights,
just like the ones I use.

339
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,069
Designed for the ultimate in
comfort and ease of movement,

340
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,942
they have outstanding
ventilation and moisture

342
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,381
One training session
in these, and you're

343
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,118
going to want to wear
them all the time.

344
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,020
Oh yeah.

345
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:58,554
-Oh!

346
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,188
This is so exciting!

347
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,057
I cannot wait!

348
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,260
Me first, Sensei, me first!

349
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:02,496
-Those tights were comfortable.

350
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,701
And I looked pretty
cool in them, too.

351
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,172
-Yeah, I bet you did.

NEJI: Yes, it's true.

If Lee weren't here--

-To effort

00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,394
-And here's to the chicken
that crossed the road.

not to have Lee around.

-Yeah, so would I.

363

TSUNADE: I realize a C-rank
mission is unworthy of you,

364
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,594
but I'm afraid you're
the only one available.

365
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:34,130
-Leave it to me.

366
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:36,702
Oh, and if I may be permitted,
I know just the person

367
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:37,704
I'd like to bring along.

Do not worry.

371
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,693
We will train agai-- huh?

372
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:52,169
-Thanks, but I don't really
think that'll be necessary.

373
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:55,243
You did well considering those
ankle weights, but still.

374
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:58,149
There's nothing special
I'd want to steal from you.

-Steal from you?

376
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,288
YAGURA: You have no
gift of your own.

377
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:05,531
You're just a hardworking grunt,
a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.

-A what?

379
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,706
YAGURA: Even Guy Sensei
himself knows that.

380
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,076
He's given up on you.

381
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,381
-(ANGRILY) That is a filthy lie!

382
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,221
Guy Sensei has always said that
his whole purpose as a ninja

383
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:19,327
is to make sure I become
a fine ninja, too.

[laughing]

385

-If that's really the case,
then let me ask you this.

386
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:27,612
Why would he ask me to
accompany him on a mission?

387
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:28,414
Me.

388

Not you.

What is it now?

406
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,426
-Yagura's in the hospital.

407
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,361
He's been badly hurt.

408
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:07,430
-What the?

409
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,332
What happened?

410
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:09,769
He was on a mission with Guy.

00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,472
-No, I'm afraid not, my lady.

412
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,613
Yagura was attacked before
he even reached the building.

413

-Then that means the trainee
traveling with Guy is--

It's one thing after another.

00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,743
And these are the only
ones left to form a squad.

do you want me to do?

Mobilize Neji,
Tenten, and Naruto

and send them after Guy
and the phony Yagura.

-Right away.

-Have her watch Lee.

427
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,677
If he learns about this,
he'll forget his injuries

428
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,280
and do something rash.

Are we sure that Bushier
Brows Sensei went this way?

-He was headed for the
Land of Mountain Streams,

433
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,402
and the most direct route
is through these woods.

00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,507
TENTEN: There's another
way through the mountains,

435
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,210
but he'd never have taken it.

I may have let his raw

that he's still only a trainee.

like these.

It seems like it
was only yesterday.

468
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,760
Still, it's very
curious to find them

469
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,897
way up here in the
middle of nowhere.

470
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:19,581
I wonder who put them up here
and for what dark purpose.

Hm.

473
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,838
So these wooden dummies
are capable of attack.

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

Nice try, but you'll
have to do better

476
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:35,883
than that, my wooden friend.

477
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,322
You're capable only of repeating
the same pattern of movement,

478
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:42,029
and your range is
only 3.5 meters,

00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:45,503
so if I just stay beyond
that, I'll be safe.

So you can move.

496
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,449
But you're earth-bound.

497
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,386
You'll never reach me up here.

Oh.

00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,591
You can jump, my wooden friend?

500
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,593
What a surprise!

501
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:33,906
[screaming]

502
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,426
Oh, no, you don't!

503
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:35,877
[yelling]

504
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,412
[laughing]

505
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,059
Huh?

506
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,622
[gasping]

507
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,535
[laughing]

508
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,708
I could use some high
altitude training.

509
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:06,644
[grunting]

510
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:08,514
[laughing]

511
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,385
[yelling]

512
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,924
LEE: 6985.

513
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,828
6986.

514
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:18,402
6987.

00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:21,074
6988.

516
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,646
6989.

517
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,586
LEE (VOICEOVER): An injury is
no excuse to stop training.

518
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,860
If I cannot use my legs, then
I will focus on my upper body

519
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,530
strength.

520
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,434
Guy Sensei must have
been disappointed in me

521
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,537
for not trying enough.

522
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,140
He took Yagura with
him on the mission only

523
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,011
to teach me a lesson.

524
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,514
Yes, that must be it!

525
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,028
6996.

526
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:43,389
6997.

00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,160
[gasping]

6998.

529
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,072
GUY (VOICEOVER): Their
defenses are rudimentary,

530
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:54,880
and their movements are
repetitive and predictable.

531
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:55,815
[grunting]

532
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:57,084
Or so I thought.

533
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,064
The biggest problem is
there are so many of them.

534
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,668
There seems to be no end.

535
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:05,670

[clicking sound]

537
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:07,775
Huh?

538
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,645
What's that sound?

539
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,051
[clicking sound]

540
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:18,631
What?

00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,583

[music playing]

545
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,157
LEE: Amazing.

546
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:06,262
This wooden dummy's
power is amazing.

547
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,066
GUY: To be able to
deflect my kicks,

548
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,270
I'm going to need
to go at full power.

549
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:11,607
LEE: All right.

550
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,711
I will have to use
every ounce of my power.

551
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:14,346
GUY: Very well.

552
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,815
Come at me with all you got.

553
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,655
LEE: But I have no choice.

554
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,661
GUY AND LEE: I must
follow my ninja way

555
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,867
all the way to the end.

556
