[theme music]

2
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:54,994
-What is this?

3
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:58,060
You come at me and
that's all you've got?

4
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:02,027
All that effort and you
couldn't even touch me.

5
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,960
What a joke!

6
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,094
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sakura.

7
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:14,627
-I don't really know how
much damage I can do.

8
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,727
But it doesn't matter.

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,994
I just have to give
it my best shot.

10
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:21,294
NARUTO: Naruto's Ninja Handbook.

11
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,160
-Shadow Clone jutsu!

12
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:33,694
Here goes!

13
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:36,560
Get ready for the
ultimate secret taijutsu!

14
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:40,027
Naruto Uzumaki Clone Body Slam!

15
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:46,994
OK!

16
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,960
Let's do it!

17
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,960
Shadow Clone jutsu!

18
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:53,960
And another!

19
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:57,427
Shadow Clone jutsu!

20
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,427
Take this!

21
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,894
Leaf Village secret taijutsu!

22
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,360
Straight from the teachings
of Kakashi-sensei!

23
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:04,860
Thousand years of death!

24
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,394
-An enema.

25
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:10,894
Great.

26
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,194
Huh?

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,427
Boom.

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,627
Hey.

29
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,127
You OK?

30
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,760
-That was a nice
move the kid pulled.

31
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:36,694
-Yeah.

32
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,094
So did he get him or not?

33
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:40,894
-Gaara.

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,827
-All of that work and
you only scored one blow?

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,994
-Ah, put a sock in it.

36
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,260
-He attacked at the
base of the tail

37
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:00,594
where the defense is weakest.

38
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:06,227
He didn't wound me, but the
sand couldn't absorb the impact.

39
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,527
Have I underestimated him?

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,194
-Naruto, listen to me.

41
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:20,060
You have to save Sakura if
it's the last thing you do.

42
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,560
Once you've got her, I want
you to take her and flee

43
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,660
as fast as you can.

44
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:27,127
It's all up to you.

45
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:33,194
-Sasuke, you--

46
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:39,494
-I can hold him here
a little longer.

47
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,694
If it ends here,
it just means this

48
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:44,494
was as far as I was meant to go.

49
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,027
I lost everything once.

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,027
I don't ever want to
have to see that again.

51
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,294
My trusted comrades falling
right in front of me.

52
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,860
-Your comrades?

53
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:03,360
Sasuke.

54
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:06,660
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I will
not allow my comrades to die.

55
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:07,860
That is absolute.

56
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:15,260
-I get it now.

57
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:19,960
Of course.

58
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,494
He's no different than I am.

59
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,794
Going through life with
the exact same sadness

60
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,327
and loneliness that
I had to carry.

61
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,494
He fought only for himself,
never relying on anyone.

62
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,927
And because of that I thought
that he possessed strength.

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,194
I really did.

64
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:40,960
-Naruto.

65
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:42,027
-I don't know.

66
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,760
I guess I should
have known better.

67
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,727
That's not what
real strength is.

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,527
If you never fight for
anyone but yourself,

69
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,827
you'll never be strong,
no matter what you do.

70
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,460
-So is there someone
who's precious to you?

71
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:57,960
Anyone?

72
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,327
The truth is when a person
has something precious

73
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,727
they want to protect
it's only then

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,694
that they become
genuinely strong.

75
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,427
You will get strong.

76
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,060
Very strong.

77
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:25,094
[gasp]

78
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:25,594
-Haaa!

79
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,527
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
He's releasing

80
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,494
a massive amount of chakra.

81
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,694
How is he doing it?

82
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:47,194
-No matter what happens, I
swear I'm going to protect you!

83
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:55,194
[groan]

84
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,194
Multi-Shadow Clone jutsu!

85
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,694
-Nice, kid.

86
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,694
Not too shabby.

87
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:12,794
-Gee, I'm sorry.

88
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,194
I didn't mean to keep
you waiting so long.

89
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,827
So get ready for an original
jutsu straight from my ninja

90
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,060
handbook!

91
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,127
-What the?

92
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,360
How could he have
summoned so many clones?

93
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:25,694
-You've got to be kidding.

94
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,594
-This is amazing.

95
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,094
I don't believe my eyes.

96
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:31,827
-Way to go there, blondie.

97
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,760
You're showing a lot of promise.

98
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,727
-How did you do this?

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,027
-Sasuke, why don't you
take it easy for a while?

100
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,127
You deserve it.

101
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,394
Just leave the rest
to Naruto Uzumaki.

102
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:47,960
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
What happened to him?

103
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,460
-All right, everyone.

104
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:50,460
Look out.

105
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,927
Here I go!

106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,927
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Unbelievable.

107
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,394
Is that Naruto?

108
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:02,827
-Let's do this!

109
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,794
Direct from Naruto's
ninja handbook!

110
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:10,260
Everywhere!

111
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:13,227
Shuriken!

112
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,727
GAARA (VOICEOVER): My
body hasn't recovered yet.

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,694
Have to use the sand to defend.

114
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:23,160
[shouting]

115
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:26,627
-Na ru to 2K.

116
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,627
Uzumaki Barrage!

117
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:43,960
[groaning]

118
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,527
From Naruto's handbook!

119
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:58,127
GAARA (VOICEOVER): That kid--

120
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,860
-This time I'll use both legs
for a barrage of 4000 kicks!

121
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:07,194
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Where did
this come from all of a sudden.

122
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,360
-Unbelievable.

123
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:11,227
Taking on Gaara in
his current form.

124
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,927
Where did that
strength come from?

125
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,360
There's no way.

126
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:20,327
Not to him!

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,960
There's absolutely
no way I'm going

128
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,660
to lose to a guy like him!

129
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:27,160
-Huh?

130
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,460
-What the?

131
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:40,827
What is that?

132
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,327
-Huh?

133
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:49,960
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): So,
he's finally emerged.

134
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:08,394
The perfect possession.

135
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,794
-So that's it.

136
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,727
The monster inside of him.

137
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,227
-Well, what do you know.

138
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,194
I never thought you would
bring this out of me!

139
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,160
[scream]

140
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,127
-Naruto!

141
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,927
[groan] My body--

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,827
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
used up all my chakra

143
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,260
on all those clones.

144
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:48,260
Sakura!

145
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:48,760
-No--

146
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,627
-Inu, tori, saru, hitsuji--

147
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,227
-This is the end for you.

148
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,527
Sand Bur--

149
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,494
-Summoning jutsu!

150
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,727
-Hm.

151
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,927
-It's amazing that he
could summon in that state.

152
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,427
-Sakura!

153
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,327
I swear I'll protect you.

154
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,455
-Naruto Uzumaki.

155
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:47,788
[chuckling] You really
are good at amusing me.

156
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:52,555
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Naruto,
how on earth can you do that?

157
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,355
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Those hours of practice

158
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,055
are finally paying off.

159
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:58,788
This'll be a breeze.

160
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:01,221
-What the?

161
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:02,621
Not you again.

162
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,021
What is this?

163
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:05,521
Huh?

164
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,821
Well, will you look at that.

165
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:15,755
Shukaku the Sand Spirit.

166
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,021
-What do you say?

167
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:18,921
Will you fight alongside
today, Chief Toad?

168
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,021
-Take a hike.

169
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,988
-Wah?

170
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:30,955
-Why go out of my way to
mess with a guy like him?

171
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:31,555
What am I?

172
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:32,221
An idiot?

173
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:32,821
-Why?

174
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,088
Are you kidding me?

175
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,055
You already told me you
would make me your henchman,

176
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,455
didn't you?

177
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,788
It's only natural a boss would
want to help out his henchman,

178
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,721
isn't it?

179
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,121
Don't you have
any sense of duty?

180
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:43,588
-Yeah.

181
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:44,588
Sure.

182
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,521
I told you I'd make
you my henchman,

183
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:52,455
but we haven't even sealed the
deal over a cup of sake yet.

184
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:53,655
-Give me a freaking break!

185
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,488
I'm not even 21 years-old yet!

186
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:58,188
I can't have any alcohol!

187
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,021
-Ah, come on, pops.

188
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:00,288
Don't be like that.

189
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,721
Why don't you just settle
down and hear the kid out?

190
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:02,355
-Huh?

191
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:03,755
Pops?

192
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,521
-And just what do you think
you're doing here, Gamakichi?

193
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,088
-I had nothing else to do.

194
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,555
I just came to hang out.

195
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:11,121
-Huh?

196
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:12,021
Huh?

197
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:13,688
You're father and son?

198
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,655
-By the way, pops, that
big ugly lug over there

199
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,955
was picking on me before.

200
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:20,188
-Come again?

201
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,388
-Oh yeah.

202
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:24,088
And when he did, my friend
here came to my rescue.

203
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,521
He went head to head and toe
to toe with that monster.

204
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,888
I'm telling you, pops.

205
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:31,121
There's a heck of a lot more
to this kid than meets the eye.

206
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,455
-Is that right?

207
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,488
-OK, kid.

208
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,921
You're hereby accepted
as my henchman.

209
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,721
Sit tight.

210
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:50,488
I'll show you what
duty is all about.

211
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:09,555
I'll take him down, but not
before he's paid for what

212
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:10,555
he's done.

213
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:11,921
That worthless little flunky!

214
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,388
Hang on tight, small fry!

215
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,321
How do you like that?

216
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,288
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Whoa.

217
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:34,821
Awesome.

218
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:58,521
[groaning]

219
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,855
CHIEF TOAD (VOICEOVER):
This guy's no joke.

220
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:04,455
I barely managed to make
that cut he's so heavy.

221
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,221
If I don't end this
quick, the landscape's

222
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:09,288
going to start
changing around here.

223
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,521
-Hey, Chief, hold on a second.

224
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:12,855
Don't go over in that direction.

225
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,521
Sakura's still there.

226
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:17,455
Try and lure him over
this way if you can, OK?

227
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:19,588
-Sakura?

228
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:21,421
-It's his little
girlfriend, pop.

229
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:22,555
Right, kid?

230
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,588
-I have to take him out.

231
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:28,088
Otherwise, Sakura's
as good as dead.

232
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:30,555
[chuckle]

233
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,521
-Interesting.

234
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,055
Interesting!

235
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:36,555
Not bad, Naruto Uzumaki!

236
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:37,521
[gasp]

237
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,021
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
This isn't good.

238
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,521
Gaara-- he's really
going to do it.

239
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,521
I have to get out of here.

240
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,255
-What the?

241
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,755
What the heck is that?

242
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:04,588
-A spiritualist medium.

243
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:07,421
-To thank you for
entertaining me here

244
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:11,288
today, I'll show
you the true power

245
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:16,455
of the manifestation
of the sand.

246
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:21,688
-The circles under his eyes,
they're signs of insomnia.

247
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:26,221
Evidence that the medium's
been possessed by the Shukaku.

248
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:27,088
-Huh?

249
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:27,588
Insomnia?

250
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:34,488
-Those possessed by
Shukaku the Sand Spirit

251
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:38,321
are no longer able to sleep
soundly through the night.

252
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:41,321
The terror is too great.

253
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:47,521
If one does sleep, the Shukaku
will eat away at your psyche,

254
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:50,821
until the person that you
once were ceases to exist.

255
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:59,421
Since he normally
doesn't get much sleep,

256
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:02,755
the medium's personality tends
to become quite unstable.

257
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:08,121
-Great.

258
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:12,455
-But as long as the
spiritualist medium is awake,

259
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:17,088
the Shukaku's true
power is held in check.

260
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:24,488
The only danger is if the
medium finally falls asleep.

261
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,488
-Play possum jutsu.

262
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:40,955
-He's done it.

263
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,788
-I don't like this
at all, Chief Toad.

264
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:45,121
What's going to happen?

265
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:49,788
-If he's set the Play
Possum jutsu in motion,

266
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,921
then the Shukaku
will be unleashed!

267
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,821
[shout]

268
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,755
-I'm finally free!

269
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,655
Here I come, baby!

270
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,255
-So that's the Sand Spirit?

271
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:06,955
-Man.

272
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:08,888
That is one funky demon.

273
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,188
-Yeah!

274
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:11,755
Here we go!

275
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,555
I hope you're ready to die.

276
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:16,788
Let's do this.

277
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,255
-I'm going to jump.

278
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:18,821
-Huh?

279
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,255
-Wind Style!

280
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:21,755
Air Bullet!

281
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:25,755
-Water Style!

282
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:26,755
Liquid Bullet!

283
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:37,688
-Well, this is nice.

284
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:39,688
I didn't know it
was going to rain.

285
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,021
-What kind of a battle
is this turning into?

286
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:46,288
-Remember, Chief.

287
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:47,721
Not in that direction!

288
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:48,921
Will you shut up?

289
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:52,221
I know already!

290
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:54,721
-Air Bullet!

291
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:55,688
-Liquid Bullet!

292
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,155
-Too bad.

293
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,655
-This is bad, Chief.

294
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:04,621
There's one more coming.

295
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:10,588
[groan]

296
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,088
-Yeah!

297
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,021
I did it.

298
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:14,121
I killed him!

299
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,888
I killed him!

300
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:22,355
-Now that kind of hurt.

301
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:25,321
That was an awful lot of chakra
that you blasted me with.

302
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:27,388
I have to admit.

303
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,755
Hit me with a couple
more of those, even

304
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,521
I won't last much longer.

305
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,288
-Chief, what should we do?

306
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:36,155
-Well, for starters,
you could wake up

307
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,588
the spiritualist medium,
to release that jutsu.

308
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:41,655
-How am I supposed to do that?

309
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:46,255
CHIEF TOAD: Just fire
off a few rounds at him.

310
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:48,721
Liquid Bullets!

311
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,155
-You missed!

312
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:54,188
[grunt]

313
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:55,421
-Now's your chance!

314
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:04,721
-Hey, Chief, you're going to
have to keep a grip on him

315
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,255
if you want me get a shot in.

316
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,655
[groan]

317
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:11,555
-My body doesn't have any claws
or horns to dig into the enemy

318
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:13,188
with.

319
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,255
-Ah!

320
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:16,021
Then what the heck
are we supposed to do?

321
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,655
-Use the transformation
jutsu to change

322
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,588
into something that
has what we need!

323
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,855
Then again, I'm not particularly
good at transformation.

324
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,321
-Huh?

325
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:28,821
-Don't worry about it.

326
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,955
You shall act upon my
will and make a handsign.

327
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:32,921
-What?

328
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:35,421
-A combined transformation!

329
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,888
-Uh-- OK.

330
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:40,388
-Conjure up something
with fangs and claws!

331
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:41,355
-Let's see.

332
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:42,355
Uh--

333
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,321
-Here we go.

334
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,155
-Hey!

335
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:47,021
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

336
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,321
Wait a second!

337
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:53,221
Fangs and claws, fangs and
claws, fangs and claws.

338
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:53,755
-Transform!

339
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:01,988
NARUTO: Transformation jutsu!

340
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,988
-That's the--

343
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:05,656
NARUTO: I don't really care
about your past or even my own.

344
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:09,189
All that matters are the
people I have to protect.

345
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,856
All right, you
pasty faced creep.

346
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:14,256
Let's finish this one on one.

347
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:16,589
I'll wrap this up with one hit.

348
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:18,122
I'm through messing around.

349
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:20,522
This blow will be the
last thing you ever feel.

350
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:21,922
You can count on it!

351
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:24,722
Next time-- beyond the
limit of darkness and light.
