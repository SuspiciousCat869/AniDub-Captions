You thought what?

64
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:22,395
-The problem is, you're
actually a right rotation type.

65
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,428
-A what?

66
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,628
-Yeah, that's the
trouble right there.

67
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:28,495
You've got your chakra
working against itself.

68
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:30,728
A good way to build
up chakra in the body

69
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,995
is to spin it into a tight
spiral, like a spring.

70
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:36,695
Whether the chakra spins
to the left or the right

71
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,728
depends on the individual.

72
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,495
Some people are left rotation
types, some are right.

73
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,462
But if you're spinning
the water in the balloon

74
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:46,928
in the opposite direction from
your natural rotation type,

75
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,028
your chakra's just
counteracting itself.

76
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:49,862
Heh.

77
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:51,095
No wonder you're having trouble.

78
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,762
It's something that
most ninja in training

79
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,828
eventually figure out for
themselves, but in your case--

80
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,862
-Yeah, OK, but how
were you able to tell

81
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:01,528
that I'm a right rotating
type or whatever it is?

82
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,728
Dah!

83
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,662
-By the way your hair grows.

84
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,562
If your hair grows
to the right, that

85
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:07,995
means you're a
right rotation type.

86
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,662
If it grows to the
left, you're a lefty.

87
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,362
It's pretty simple, really.

88
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,562
-Huh.

89
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,628
If I ever brushed my hair,
I might have known that.

90
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:17,995
-You get it now?

91
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,195
It might help if you set the
water in the balloon rotating

92
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:21,262
to the right.

93
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,362
-Man, I never even
knew my hair rotated.

94

-I think you'll find this is the
perfect jutsu for you, Naruto.

signs to to mastered.

to be hokage some day!

have this whole thing nailed.

down to us by none other

00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,128
than the fourth hokage!

-Huh?

110
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:01,395
-Yes, and it took the fourth
hokage three whole years

111
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,862
to perfect it.

112
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,295
In terms of difficulty, this
is the second hardest jutsu

113
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:07,662
of all.

114
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:11,795
It's one of the
master-rank ninjutsu.

115
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,262
To learn this move
requires mastering

116
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,462
three different
phases of training.

117

The water balloon burst
is only the first.

118

NARUTO: It took the
fourth hokage three years

119
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:29,028
and he was the best!

120
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:32,662
-And you, who haven't even
finished the first phase yet,

121
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:35,262
you're going to master
it in three days, huh?

He found a way to do it.

By steadying it
with his left hand

and applying chakra
with his right.

-Huh?

256
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:50,850
-I was watching this guy
play around with my balloon

257
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,650
and I got a brilliant idea.

258
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,050
See, he kept knocking
it back and forth,

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,550
which meant the water
inside must be going back,

260
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,517
too, in different directions.

261
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,917
That's when it came to me.

262
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,983
-And what would be, exactly?

263
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,650
-I thought back to
when you were showing

264
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,850
me what to do that first time.

265
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,950
I remembered how bumpy
the surface of the balloon

266
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:13,050
got, like it was boiling.

267
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,850
My problem was, I was
making the water rotate,

268
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,683
but in only one direction.

269
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:20,717
That's why my balloon was
smooth, not bumpy like yours.

270
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,083
If it was going to burst, I
had to get the water spinning

271
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,550
in a bunch of
different directions,

272
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,817
bumping into itself.

273
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,517
So once I finally figured that
part out, the rest was easy.

274
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,517
JIRAIYA: Well, he still may
not be capable of executing it

275
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,850
with only one hand,
but he found a way.

276
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,550
And it works.

up a lot of chakra.

withstand the strain?

332
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,950
like a shinobi.

333
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:34,583
-Uh.

334
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:35,817
All right, I will.

335
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,850
I was just hoping before
you go you could just

336
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:41,817
show it to me one more time.

337
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,617
-Pay me.

338
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,250
-Get out of here, you
greedy old skirt chaser!

339
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,117
You're one to talk about growing
up and acting like a shinobi!

340
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,883
Why don't you act
like a shinobi instead

341
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,017

NARUTO: [heavy breathing]
a Just like he said,

343
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,850
this is way more difficult
than the water balloon!

344
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:18,717
My arms and hands
are killing me.

345
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,750
Don't know how much
more they can take.

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,950
Stop whining!

352
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,650
I'm not holding your hand.

353
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:11,483
You have to do this
yourself or not at all.

354
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:11,983
-All right.

355
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,817
-Hey, Naruto!

356
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,950
-What are you doing
here, Pervy Sage?

357
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,650
-I want you to hop into
town and grab me some lunch.

358
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:23,350
-Huh?

359
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,917
Why do I have to?

360
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,250
-I'm your teacher, and
a student is always

361
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:29,283
obliged to obey his teacher.

362
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:29,850
-Grrr.

363
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,383
-Here you go, son.

364
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,017
-Thanks, thanks a lot.

"I'm your teacher."

366
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,717
Some teacher!

367
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,217
What's he taught me?

368
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,017
Nothin'.

369
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,183
CHILD: I one of those, Dad!

370
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,150
Can I?

371
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,250
The frozen food on a stick.

372
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:50,783
Please?

373
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,250
-There you go.

374
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:56,983
-Awww.

375
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,650
I'm big now!

376
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,383
I can eat the whole
t hing myself.

377
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,617
-No, we'll share.

378
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,050
Besides, what would
your mother say

379
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,150
if I let you spoil your supper?

380
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,650
-OK.

381
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:14,683
-Say, I was wondering.

382
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,483
Well, um, maybe you could
stick around for a while

383
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,483
today, help me train?

384
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:20,617
-Sorry, no time.

385
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,517
I've got to go into town
and keep an appointment

386
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,483
with someone who's helping
me with my research.

387
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,350
It's up to you to figure
out by yourself, Naruto.

388
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,517
Otherwise, there's no
point in even learning it,

389
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,550
for all the good it will do you.

390
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,517
I thought I made it
clear three weeks ago.

391
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,250
Stop acting like
a helpless child!

392
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:40,883
You're a ninja.

393
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,250
-Haha!

394
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:48,883
Oh, sure!

395
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:49,883
Of course.

396
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,450
Don't worry about
me, I understand.

397
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:52,483
Forget about it.

398
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:53,783
I was just asking, that's all.

399
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:57,150
Go on and do whatever you
have to do, Pervy Sage.

400
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:57,750
-No!

401
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:58,817
You did that?

402
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,383
I don't think I believe you.

403
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,817
-Hey, it's true!

404
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,250

What's the use?

411
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,683
It won't pop, no
matter how hard I try!

412
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm just wasting
my time, burning up

413
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,417
chakra for no good reason.

414
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,350
NARUTO: And this pain!

415
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:46,783
The more I try to increase
the flow, the more it hurts.

416
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,083
But I have to.

417
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:51,150
I have to give it all I've
got or it'll never pop!

418
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,417
But what if all I've
got isn't enough?

419

That's it!

420
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,583
If I can work through the
pain to generate more chakra

421
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,983
and then push it right to the
limit of what I can endure--

422

nngh, not enough yet.

Not yet!

00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,050
Still not enough!

Focus, focus, focus!

Doesn't he know I'm
easily distracted?

It's always been my weak
spot all through training.

452
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:12,669
Iruka-sensei used to chew me
out about my lack of focus.

453
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:15,569
I wish I'd paid more attention
to him, but I was, you know,

00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,103
