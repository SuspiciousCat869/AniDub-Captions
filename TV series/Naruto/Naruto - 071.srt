00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,255
-Well, Tomari, what's up?

3
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:06,731
-He's close.

4
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:08,233
Very close.

5
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,068
-I knew it.

6
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,138
What do we do?

7
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,275
-Leave everything to me.

8
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,606
-Well, that was close.

9
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,140
-Whoa.

10
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:54,512
What was that?

11
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,115
-Trip-wire traps.

12
00:02:56,148 --> 00:03:00,590
They're certainly not making
Sasuke's job easy for him.

13
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:01,658
-Sasuke.

14
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,027
Do you think he
might have been--

15
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,298
-Oh, don't worry about Sasuke.

16
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:07,802
It'd take a lot more than
that to get rid of him.

17
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:10,106
He'll be fine

18
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,942
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER) I
sure hope you're right.

19
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:23,963
OROCHIMARU: Now then,
shall we begin this?

20
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,868
First, let me restore
these dear old companions

21
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,541
of yours to something more
like their former selves.

22
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,845
And then, if you're
ready Sarutobi-sensei.

23
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,656
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): An unrivaled
match-- Hokage Battle Royale.

24
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:26,169
-They're coming alive.

25
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,174
What the devil kind
of jutsu is that?

26
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:32,179
A forbidden one.

27
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:35,151
It's a summoning jutsu
called reanimation.

28
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:41,127
Normally, a summoning
jutsu requires

29
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:44,667
the blood of the
casting it, but I've

30
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,272
heard that this
jutsu, which summons

31
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,642
the dead to the
world of the living,

32
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:52,881
demands the sacrifice
of a living body

33
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,786
to be used as a vessel
for the dead soul.

34
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,291
-Then those are
not their bodies,

35
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,961
but two living sacrifices?

36
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,197
-Right.

37
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,134
But then the living
body is encased

38
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,438
in a shell of dust
and earth that

39
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:10,712
takes on the appearance of the
dead spirit's earthly form.

40
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,216
Those spells he implanted
in their skulls,

41
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,286
they sap the spirits
of their will,

42
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,795
and transform them into his
puppets, mere killing machines.

43
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,298
[laughter]

44
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:25,670
-Now they're complete.

45
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:27,473
-You demon.

46
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,978
They look just the
same as I remember.

47
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,816
-Have you ever felt
the joy and fulfillment

48
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,758
of humiliating and destroying
the one you once called sensei?

49
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,325
No.

50
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,727
I suppose not.

51
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,731
Perhaps vicariously
through me you'll

52
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,002
get a hint of what I mean.

53
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:45,805
Just a taste, before you die.

54
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,419
-Lord Hokage!

55
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:15,255
Don't be deceived
by their appearance!

56
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:18,694
That is not the first
Hokage, nor the second!

57
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,799
Whatever they may look like.

58
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,236
-I'm aware of that.

59
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:40,832
All right.

60
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,669
Let it begin.

61
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,904
Fire Style!

00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,106

Water Wall!

66
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:15,959
-Huh?

67
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,433
-Amazing.

68
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,437
To cast so powerful
a Water Style

69
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,508
jutsu where there is no water.

70
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:26,977
It's beyond belief.

71
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:36,293
-It's no less than I'd
expect from a former Hokage.

72
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:41,836
-Water Style!

73
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,504
Water Shockwave!

HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
Fighting the two of you

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,233
at once is quite a challenge.

81
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,344
The hidden jutsu of
the first Hokage.

82
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:07,785
-Secret Earth jutsu.

So this is the
legendary Secret Earth

88
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,248
jutsu of the first Hokage.

89

He who brought peace to the
land and founded the Hidden Leaf

00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,937

this fight is over.

Good.

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,818
All right then.

97
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,321
Let's start evacuating
the building.

98
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:44,496
That's it.

99
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:45,398
No rushing.

100
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:46,700
No panicking.

101
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:50,406
-Konohamaro, is something wrong?

102
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,445
You look like you
have a tummy-ache.

103
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,215
-Mm.

104
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,483
That's not it at all.

-Hm.

109
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:37,954
So, a pesky newcomer
has arrived.

110
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,898
That old monkey, Enma.

111
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,751
-It's you again.

112
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:58,656
I should have known
this would happen.

113
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:01,328
You fool, Sarutobi.

114
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,998
you should have killed
when you had the chance.

115
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,801
-Better late than never.

116
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,037
-Heh.

117
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,540
It's too late now.

Enma, Adamantine Nyoi!

121
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,790
-Stop him now!

122
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:20,260
Do not let him transform.

123
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,168
-All right then.

124
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,505
Understood!

125
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:34,918
[grunting]

126
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:35,486
Transform!

127
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:44,968
-At last.

128
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,949
-Unbelievable.

129
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:59,693
I never dreamed I would live to
see this-- Hokage level combat.

130
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,630
-Good for you, old man.

131
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:04,135
At least you've made this
a little more interesting.

132
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,057
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): What of it?

133
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,060
One swing of the
grass longsword--

134
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,843
-Are you ready, Enma?

135
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:31,715
ENMA: No matter how
strong my body is,

136
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:34,687
the grass longsword
will still hurt me.

137
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:30,615
-He's mine.

138
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,161
-Lord Hokage!

139
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,969
-That was foolish.

140
00:15:43,003 --> 00:15:46,075
Trying to fight the three of us
without using your Shadow Clone

141
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,945
jutsu.

142
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:48,546
-That's right.

143
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,349
He didn't use.

144
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,986
But only because
he couldn't use it.

145
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,092
To disperse his chakra
among a pack of clones

146
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:58,596
and then create more
when those has fallen,

147
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,134
such things are beyond him now.

148
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,039
He hasn't the reserves
of chakra he once had.

149
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,408
It's true.

150
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,610
He's grown old.

151
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,426
-Oh, are you all right, sensei?

152
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,699
Don't tell me you're
through already.

153
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:21,034
You?

154
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,773
The great sage who has mastered
all the jutsu of the Leaf

155
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:24,775
Village?

156
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:27,713
The legendary
professor and warrior?

157
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:30,651
Oh, I'm so disappointed.

158
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:34,825
[laughter]

159
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:35,994
-Lord Hokage!

160
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,062
Please get up.

161
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,030
You must!

162
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,602
Without you the Leaf
Village is lost.

00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:41,569
Lord Hokage!

-Save your breath.

165
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,281
He can't help you now.

[chuckling]

167
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,536
-What's wrong with
you, Sarutobi?

168
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:04,008
Surely you didn't
summon me just for this.

169
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,178
To watch you crumble.

170
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:08,683
What are you waiting for?

171
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,118
Now is the time to defeat him!

172
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,601
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Orochimaru.

173
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:30,420
-Orochimaru, you're a fool!

174
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:30,921
-Huh?

175
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:36,898
[grunting]

176
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,901
ENMA: It's over.

177
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,972
I'm going to snap
you like a twig.

178
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:43,810
It should have been
done years ago.

179
00:17:53,426 --> 00:18:01,840
[shout]

180
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:11,924
[grunting]

181
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:57,468
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
I should have known.

182
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,705
It's useless attacking
their bodies as long

183
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:04,881
as their souls are bound to
this earth by Orochimaru's will.

184
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,050
So be it.

185
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,187
I have only one weapon left.

186
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,090
The fourth Hokage's jutsu.

187
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:18,437
First lord Hokage,
second lord Hokage,

188
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:23,580
forgive me for using
it, but I must.

189
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,283
-What is it, sensei?

190
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:27,520
You look a little out of breath.

191
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:30,057
Long day?

192
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:31,894
You poor thing.

193
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:37,036
All you really want is to take
a long quiet nap, isn't it?

194
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:40,909
[chuckling]

195
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,981
-Why are you're laughing?

196
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,719
-Should I be weeping?

197
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,224
It's sad to see how
old you've grown.

198
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:54,999
You who were once hailed
as the Supreme Shinobi.

199
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:55,500
-Whoa.

200
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:03,714
-What the hell's going on?

201
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:08,823
Who or what is that?

202
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,125
-What is this?

203
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,163
Who the devil are you?

204
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:14,933
-You have lost it, old man.

205
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,670
Don't you recognize me?

206
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:17,905
It's me, Orochimaru.

207
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,415
-It can't be.

208
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:26,788
Then you've mastered even
that forbidden jutsu?

209
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:32,097
[chuckling]

210
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,066
-You're no longer human.

211
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,402
You're a demon!

212
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:45,486
[laughter]

213
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:05,787
SASUKE: I finally caught you.

214
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,825
Did you really think that
I'd let you get away?

215
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,597
-Oh, geez.

216
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,832
-If it isn't Sasuke Uchiha.

217
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:17,875
-This is as far as you guys go.

218
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:30,638
[theme music]

219
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:13,982
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): You were
one of a kind, Orochimaru.

220
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:15,685
The most brilliant
and gifted ninja

221
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:18,189
in that time of
war and darkness.

222
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:21,561
In you I thought I had
found the one to succeed.

223
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,264
How blind I was.

224
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,134
What a trusting fool.

225
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,037
And it is that
blindness of mine that

226
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,641
has led to all this
pain and death.

227
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:34,650
It's time I corrected my
mistake and buried you forever!

228
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,581
NARUTO: Next time-- a
mistake from the past!

229
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:39,848
A face revealed!
