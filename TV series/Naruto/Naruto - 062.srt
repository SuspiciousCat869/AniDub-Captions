00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,678
[music playing]

2
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:18,180
-It's your destiny
to lose to me.

3
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:20,918
And that's it.

4
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:22,153
-Oh, yeah?

5
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,992
Well, we won't know that
until you beat me, will we?

6
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,964
[panting]

7
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:34,873
-OK.

8
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,809
So your father was
killed a long time ago,

9
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:40,181
and I know it wasn't fair and
maybe you're upset about that,

10
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:41,549
I understand.

11
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,019
But that's got nothing
to do with destiny.

12
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:47,257
If you think I'm buying
that, you're wrong.

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,927
-You will never understand.

14
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,526
-It's over.

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,669
Hm.

16
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:17,637
You're a failure.

17
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:34,428
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A
Failure's True Power

18
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:38,769
NARUTO: Wait, don't
walk away from me.

19
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,609
I'm not done yet.

20
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:49,651
I don't quit, and I
don't go back on my word.

21
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,654
That's my nindo, my ninja way.

22
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:09,014
-I never go back on my word.

23
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:15,758
Because that, too, is
my nindo, my ninja way.

24
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,929
-I've heard those words before.

25
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:24,738
All this destiny crap, well,
if you really believe it,

26
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:28,577
why are you the
one walking away?

27
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,879
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

28
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,822
-You impudant little brat!

29
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,395
Why waste my breath
explaining it to you?

30
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:42,798
We are all given a
destiny at birth,

31
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:44,934
and it's pointless
to fight against it.

32
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:55,851
HIZASHI: Neji, my son,
the Hyuga bloodline trait

33
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:59,857
flows stronger in you than in
any other member of our clan.

34
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:05,566
I should have been born
a few moments earlier

35
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,803
and made you part of
the main household.

36
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,980
-You don't know what it's like
to be branded with a mark that

37
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,853
sets you apart, a market
that can never be wiped away.

38
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:38,382
[crying]

39
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:02,952
-Oh yeah.

40
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,889
I know what that's like.

41
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,330
Well, big deal.

42
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,333
Who cares?

43
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,103
-You worthless little--

44
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:19,711
-Man, you think
you've got troubles.

45
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,214
I've got news for
you Neji, you're

46
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,483
not the only special
one around here.

47
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:27,990
Did you ever think
that Hinata might

48
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,993
be suffering as much as you are.

49
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:33,432
it's not her fault that her
father was born ahead of yours,

50
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:35,535
but you resent her for it.

51
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,238
You disrespect her
even when she's

52
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,574
trying so hard to
improve herself.

53
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,345
All she wanted was your respect.

54
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:45,316
That's what she was fighting
for even though it almost

55
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,317
killed her.

56
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:49,222
And what was that
all about anyway?

57
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:52,527
I thought it was your destiny
to serve the main household, not

58
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,163
to neat it to a bloody pulp.

59
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:57,000
After all you said about how
you can't fight your destiny,

60
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,072
you don't really believe
in it either, do you?

61
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,694
AKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Her color
is coming back to her face.

62
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,464
He did it!

63
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:22,939
Woah, these Anbu BlackOps,
they are really good.

64
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,677
-She'll be all right now.

65
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,678
She just needs rest.

66
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,457
[coughing]

67
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:43,738
-I have blocked all 64
of your chakra points.

68
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,240
How are you planning
to keep fighting

69
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:47,710
when you can't use any of
your chakra against me?

70
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,352
It's fitting that you
sympathize with Hinata

71
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:56,423
because you're about
to share her fate.

72
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:57,925
-Oh really?

73
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,030
You think that Byakugan
of yours sees everything.

74
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,502
You know everyone's
weakness, right?

75
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,037
-That's right.

76
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,508
But if you think you're the
one who can prove me wrong,

77
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,744
well, be my guest.

78
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,080
-You got it.

79
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:13,816
I'm going to show you
you're wrong about a lot

80
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,419
of things starting right now.

81
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,260
Yeah, easier said than done.

82
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:24,599
It doesn't feel like I
have any chakra at all.

83
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:27,069
I haven't felt so totally
drained since that time

84
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:28,772
in training with the Pervy Sage.

85
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,383
-Haven't you ever felt the
presence of a different chakra?

86
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,755
You have two types of chakra,
but you must use up all of one

87
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:42,392
before you can assess the
other and, thus, increase

88
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:45,597
the total amount of
chakra you can use.

89
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:46,866
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That's it!

90
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,169
I can use the
Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra.

91
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,322
[growling]

92
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:07,230
OK you stinking fox, if you're
there, give me your strength!

93
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,237
[heart beating]

94
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:15,242
NEJI: Proctor, this has
gone on long enough.

95
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,212
I suggest you stop the match.

96
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:19,482
If he's foolish enough
to continue to fight,

97
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:23,955
I will not be responsible
for what happens to him.

98
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,557
-Fine.

99
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:26,158
NARUTO: Hm.

100
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,668
-It's pointless, I told you.

101
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,444
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can do it.

102
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,779
I won't lose.

103
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,520
I vow to win.

104
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,723
-Why bother?

105
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:48,258
You have no chakra to use.

106
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:52,331
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can do it.

107
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,102
Oh yeah, don't forget
to watch me wipe off

108
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,439
the floor with Neji in
the final competition.

109
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,782
Uh!

110
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,251
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): A
loser beating the genius

111
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:07,254
through sheer willpower.

112
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,492
Now, would not that make
for an exciting match?

113
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:13,930
Of course, if you ended up
fighting him that is fine too.

114
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:28,386
-Why fight a hopeless battle
trying to defy your destiny?

115
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:39,202
-Cause people
called me a failure.

116
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:40,805
I'll prove them wrong.

117
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:58,264
NEJI (VOICEOVER): What?

118
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,634
It can't be.

119
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,971
Where is that
chakra coming from?

120
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,798
It's-- it's not possible!

121
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:36,488
What-- what is he?

122
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,091
HIZASHI (VOICEOVER): Impossible.

123
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,493
That chakra.

124
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:41,662
-This can't be happening.

125
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:42,664
No way!

126
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:46,837
-But how?

127
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,040
All of his chakra
points were blocked.

128
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:00,758
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): No question.

129
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,063
It's the chakra of
the Nine-Tailed Fox.

130
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:07,668
But when did this boy learn
how to harness it's strength?

131
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,505
-Here it goes.

132
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,329
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Incredible!

133
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,330
Twisting energy.

134
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,675
What kind of chakra is that?

135
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,720
Or is it even chakra at all?

136
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,019
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Amazing!

137
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,389
This is even more power
than I felt before.

138
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,529
I like it!

139
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:49,392
NEJI: Rotation!

140
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,712
Take this.

141
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:05,083
What?

142
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,952
He's faster than before.

143
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:07,853
What's going on here?

144
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:39,435
-OK you.

145
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,904
So I hear you like
close combat, huh?

146
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:48,715
NEJI (VOICEOVER): You
thought you could be Hokage?

147
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,651
It's absurd, never.

148
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:54,557
Open your eyes.

149
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,593
Of all the shinobi
in all the world,

150
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:59,898
think how few ever
become Hokage.

151
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:02,836
They were born,
destined to be Hokage.

152
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,141
It's not something you become
merely by trying to become it.

153
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:09,280
They were chosen by destiny.

154
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:12,517
Each person is given his
own path to follow up,

155
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,292
and he must follow it,
obediently, to the end.

156
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,667
-It may be the Hyuga way
to cave in to destiny.

157
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:25,470
It's not mine!

158
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,473
if you think it's futile
to fight, then don't.

159
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,009
Just stand there and take it!

160
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,077
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Quickly!

161
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,080
Must use my rotation.

162
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:40,059
-I'll change the way
of the Hyuga clan

163
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,428
after I become Hokage.

164
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:50,475
[explosion]

165
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:31,904
SHINOBI (VOICEOVER): Man, that's
some chakra that kid's got.

166
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,341
Never seen anything like it.

167
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:36,777
No way that Hyuga
kid could have--

168
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,626
-But, which one's Naruto?

169
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:47,694
-Don't ask me.

170
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,396
I don't even know what
happened just now.

171
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,712
-Huh?

172
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:28,089
[gasp]

173
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:29,691
[sigh]

174
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:31,694
[panting]

175
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:54,762
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): That'S
the secret of Neji's rotation

176
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,366
technique, it not only
blocks any attack,

177
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,170
but it turns the energy of
an opponent's own chakra

178
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:01,372
against him.

179
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:03,909
And Naruto went right into it.

180
00:18:03,943 --> 00:18:06,880
There's not a genin
alive who can beat Neji.

181
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:10,152
But still, I've got to
hand it to you, Naruto,

182
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:12,488
you came closer than
anyone ever has.

183
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:18,464
NEJI: Sorry, but
this is reality.

184
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,534
You're a failure.

185
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,870
This match is over.

186
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:25,241
[explosion]

187
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:39,897
[screaming]

188
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:56,788
-(PAINFULLY) I can't move.

189
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,504
SHINOBI (VOICEOVER): He
used his clone as bate

190
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,775
and waited for his
chance to get Neji.

191
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,811
Even when he was getting
pounded into the ground,

192
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,515
he never stopped
planning his next move.

193
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,019
He never lost his faith
in his ability to win.

194
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:19,790
Naruto knows instinctively
that believing in yourself

195
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,561
can give you the power
to change your destiny.

196
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,599
And on top of that, he's
got one hell of a left hook.

197
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,781
-I should have guessed you'd
use that shadow clone jutsu.

198
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:38,251
It's your specialty after all.

199
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:39,787
I was careless.

200
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,738
-For the record, I failed the
graduation exam three times

201
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:56,378
because there was this one jutsu
that was always on the exam.

202
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,982
And it tripped me up every time.

203
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:02,221
It was the one jutsu that
I just couldn't master.

204
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:22,652
My clones were pathetic.

205
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:23,953
That's right.

206
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:26,190
I flunked the shadow
clone jutsu every time.

207
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:36,272
So don't come whining to
me with this density stuff.

208
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,810
And stop trying to tell me
you can't change what you are.

209
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:52,830
You can do it, too.

210
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,935
Cause, after all, unlike
me, you're not a failure.

211
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:16,699
SHINOBI: The winner
is Naruto Uzumaki.

212
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,839
[cheering]

213
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:33,444
[music playing]

214
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:02,946
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Woohoo!

215
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,515
I won!

216
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,550
Yes, thank you.

217
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,185
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
(ANNOYED) Naruto.

218
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,387
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What is it?

219
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,389
You want an autograph
or something?

220
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:10,658
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): No, shut up.

221
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:12,293
Do you always have
to be such a jerk?

222
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,063
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's wrong, Sakura?

223
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:15,365
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): It's Sasuke.

224
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,301
He's still not here.

225
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:18,803
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh, typical.

226
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:22,075
I almost get killed, and all
she can think about is him.

227
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:24,478
Next time, Hit It or Quit It.

228
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:26,214
The Final Rounds
Get Complicated.

229
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:28,051
Ah, to hell with Sasuke!

230
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:30,821
I won!

231
00:23:30,855 --> 00:23:34,311
