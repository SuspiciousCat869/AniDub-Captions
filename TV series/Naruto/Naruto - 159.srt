[theme music]

00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:05,169
-Akamaru!

00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:08,169
[barking]

4
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:14,103
-Wait up, Akamaru!

5
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,469
[barking]

6
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:27,569
-Naruto, I, uh-- Well, I--
I made some lunch for you.

7
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:29,069
If you're hungry, go ahead.

8
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:32,969
-Ah, thank you.

9
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:33,469
Hm.

10
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:40,303
You gotta be kidding.

11
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:43,003
Why are you guys acting
all goofy out here?

12
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:45,236
This isn't a picnic, you know?

13
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:45,869
-You're right.

14
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:46,436
Sorry.

15
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,269
-Aw, come on.

16
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:48,636
Lighten up, will you?

17
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,836
This mission's gonna be a cinch,
even with only three of us.

18
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,403
You made the stink about
it being boring, remember?

19
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:54,936
-Hm.

20
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,003
This missions boring
and I don't wanna go!

21
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,103
Go catch some petty thief?

22
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:04,069
Come on!

23
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,103
Anybody could do it!

24
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,369
Why's it gotta be us?

25
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,469
-Look, Naruto.

26
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:10,669
I would just send Kiba,
Hinata, and Shino out

27
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:12,436
as a squad like
usual, But the thing

28
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:15,669
is, Shino's already
gone out on a mission.

29
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:18,203
And I figured sending you along
would be better than nothing.

30
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:20,103
-What'd you say, grandma?

31
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:23,636
I am so way better than nothing!

32
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,103
-We'll all do our best.

33
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:28,603
-This mission is kind
of a snooze, you know.

34
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:31,169
-Well, no point
picking a team leader.

35
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,903
Not for this one.

36
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,869
Your mission is to capture
this man, Gosunkugi, also known

37
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:38,536
as The Nail.

38
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,603
He stole the Misogi
tea jar, owned

39
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,703
by the Land of
Tea's feudal lord.

40
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:46,569
He's keeping his head
low, hiding somewhere

41
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,936
in the Land of Stone we believe.

42
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:49,703
Enough talk.

43
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:50,403
Get moving.

44
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,669
I want him caught ASAP.

45
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:54,369
-I thought this mission
couldn't possibly

46
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,769
get any lamer than it
was, but it just did!

47
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:01,203
-Akamaru.

48
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:01,836
Dig in.

49
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,403
You know, the occasional
easy assignment never hurts.

50
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:10,436
Nothing wrong with
taking it easy.

51
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,503
-Exactly!

52
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,269
If it's so easy, let's
just get it done!

53
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:15,069
What if Pervy Sage comes
back to the village

54
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,803
and I'm stuck out here?

55
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,136
-I'm sorry, Naruto.

56
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,236
Forgive me.

57
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,336
I just-- Well I was so
happy to be sent out

58
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:26,236
on something with you.

59
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,236
-Huh?

60
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,236
What are you mumbling
about, Hinata?

61
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,803
Can't hear you!

62
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,003
And how come your
cheeks are so red?

63
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:33,036
You're a weird one.

64
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,303
-Well, good news,
Mr. I'm-In-A-Hurry.

65
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:36,503
Look.

66
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:39,969
The Land of Stone's on the
other side of that pass.

67
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:40,936
Might as well eat it.

68
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,869
No point being bored and hungry.

69
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,803
-I sure didn't expect to
be eating my own face when

70
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:50,836
I woke up this morning.

71
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,736
Oh, wow.

72
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,169
Seriously, Hinata
you're gonna make

73
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:57,836
somebody one heck of a wife!

74
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:00,369
-What?

75
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,369
Once heck of a wife!

76
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:30,503
-There's post station one.

77
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,369
Let's check it out.

78
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:36,103
KIBA: Looks a little
rough, don't you think?

79
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:36,603
-Hm.

80
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,236
The Bounty Hunter
from the Wilderness!

81
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,203
Why are they staring at us?

82
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:16,269
Don't all these slackers
have somewhere to be?

83
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,603
-I'm not getting the easy
vibe on this one anymore.

84
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:25,869
[growling]

85
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:26,736
-What is it, Akamaru?

86
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,869
What do you think?

87
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:38,736
That Gosunkugi guy-- you
figure he's here somewhere?

88
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:42,136
[growling]

89
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,303
-Speak of the devil!

90
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:45,803
-Huh?

91
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,303
-It's a photo.

92
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:53,236
-Well, at least it's
of the right guy, so.

93
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:56,836
-Reward.

94
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:58,403
Three million.

95
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,869
So, what's that about?

96
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,269
-Hey, look.

97
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,236
They've been put up
all over the place.

98
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,336
-All right.

99
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:11,003
I'm gonna ask the
locals what's up!

100
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,003
How's it going?

101
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:22,303
-Can I help you?

102
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,903
-Oh, we're not customers.

103
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:25,669
We just has a question.

104
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,169
-Is that so?

105
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,136
If you kids ain't buying
nothing, then beat it.

106
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,136
-Well, if that's the
way it's gotta be.

107
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:32,303
One ramen!

108
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,103
-Hook me up with a
cheeseburger, and some milk

109
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:35,203
for the little guy.

110
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,203
[barking]

111
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:38,169
[laughing]

112
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,603
-A cheeseburger and milk?

113
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,003
You gotta be kidding me!

114
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:42,836
-Hey, and the ramen.

115
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:43,903
You can't forget that.

116
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:51,336
-I don't care much for smart
alecky brats, so get out!

117
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,403
-We've got the
money to pay for it.

118
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:55,736
-It ain't about the money.

119
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:58,503
-Well, shouldn't carry
such a big bag of coins.

120
00:07:58,536 --> 00:07:59,536
Isn't safe.

121
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,136
I'll do you a favor
and hold onto it.

122
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,403
I mean, you wouldn't want
one of these ruffians getting

123
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,169
his paws on your dough.

124
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:06,136
-Hey, you in or out?

125
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,703
The cards are getting cold.

126
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:08,536
-I'm coming.

127
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,069
Just keep your pants on.

128
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,136
You want some of
this money or not?

129
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:12,869
Huh?

130
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,303
You stupid or something?

131
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,303
Let it go.

132
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,769
-You're the one who's
gonna let it go!

133
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,803
You like that?

134
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,336
-You mouthy little brat.

135
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,503
You wanna fight me?

136
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:28,303
-Something like that, genius.

137
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,069
Bring it on!

138
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:30,903
-You punk.

139
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:33,069
-Are we really gonna do this?

140
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:33,769
-Yeah, Naruto.

141
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:34,436
Look.

142
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,936
-Hm?

143
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:41,836
Man.

144
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,736
This is bad.

145
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,069
-Glass of milk, if you please.

146
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,469
-Who the heck's this guy?

147
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:51,136
-Right.

148
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:54,603
Coming up.

149
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:55,403
Enjoy.

150
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:57,203
-Much obliged.

151
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,369
Now, now.

152
00:08:58,403 --> 00:08:59,669
No need to be shy.

153
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:00,936
Drink up.

154
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:03,569
Courtesy of that gentleman
over there, Old Mr. Cueball.

155
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,636
-So I'm Old Mr. Cueball, huh?

156
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:09,936
Real funny, jerk.

157
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:12,503
And why would I buy milk
for some random mutt?

158
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,903
You gotta death
with or something?

159
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,936
-One Michizo [inaudible].

160
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,403
Reward if captured.

161
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:35,536
The credit goes to you, barkeep.

162
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,336
You can take the milk
money out of his bounty.

163
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,569
And buy yourself a new
table while you're at it.

164
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:44,436
Feel free to keep the change.

165
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:47,236
-That guy's strong.

166
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,303
-I'm sorry.

167
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,436
Was he yours?

168
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:50,969
My apologies.

169
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:56,569
-Hey!

170
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:57,536
Wait up!

171
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,136
-Something you want, young man?

172
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:02,903
-That was awesome.

173
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,703
What's your name old guy?

174
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,703
SAZANAMI (VOICEOVER):
Old guy, is it?

175
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:07,669
Hmph.

176
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:08,869
-The name is Sazanami.

177
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:09,836
I'm a bounty hunter.

178
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:15,769
-That is so cool.

179
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:18,403
-Old guy!

180
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,636
You know what?

181
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,669
That one thing you did
earlier was totally amazing.

182
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:22,669
-Hm?

183
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,569
That business with
the sword, you mean?

184
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,869
-You drew your sword on
Old Mr. Cueball so fast,

185
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:28,236
I couldn't even see it.

186
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,003
-It was really surprising.

187
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,403
-When someone says in
the blink of an eye,

188
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:35,369
I bet you that's the kind of
thing they're talking about.

189
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:36,869
-When you're a
bounty hunter, you

190
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,103
stare death in the
face every day.

191
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,969
I could have more
lives than a cat,

192
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,936
but it wouldn't help any
if I can't draw faster

193
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,969
than the guy in front of me.

194
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:45,969
-Well shucks howdy!

195
00:10:46,003 --> 00:10:48,103
So what do you bounty
hunter guys do?

196
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:50,036
-Well, it's simple.

197
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,903
Sometimes people
put out a reward

198
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:55,069
on the bad guys who are too
tough to catch for free.

199
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,136
Bounty hunters round
up those bad guys

200
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,103
and earn the reward, or bounty.

201
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:02,003
It's the same thing.

202
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,369
-I get it.

203
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,436
Then this guy has a
bounty on him too, right?

204
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:09,069
A really big one!

205
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,036
-That's a picture of--

206
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,703
-But how come they put so
much money on this guy's head

207
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:16,169
if he's nothing but
your everyday crook?

208
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,169
-An every day crook,
you called him?

209
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,869
Boy, that man's a
hardened killer.

210
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,003
He's murdered dozens
of people for the sake

211
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,236
of robbing their courses.

212
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,369
They don't get any
worse than this fella.

213
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,803
-No way.

214
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:28,969
-Are you kidding me?

215
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,003
Can that really be true?

216
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,703
They didn't tell us
anything about it.

217
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,936
-Well, perhaps the feudal lord
who's paying for this mission

218
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,269
didn't even know it himself.

219
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,169
-A mission, huh?

220
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:40,203
-Uh huh.

221
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,836
The three of us are
Hidden Leaf ninja

222
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,469
out on a super
important mission.

223
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,603
We came to this town
to capture Gosunkugi.

224
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,036
SAZANAMI (VOICEOVER):
Hidden Leaf?

225
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:51,403
-Is that so?

226
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:52,569
You mean you kids are ninja?

227
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,669
Well, I'll be.

228
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,236
Can't say I've ever
met a ninja who

229
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,036
wasn't old enough
to shave before.

230
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,736
-Hey!

231
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:01,936
Don't make fun of us!

232
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:02,869
Got it old guy?

233
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,369
-Begging your pardon there, kid.

234
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:06,069
Didn't mean to rile you up.

235
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:08,236
What's say you let
me make it up to you?

236
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,436
Some milk, maybe?

237
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:10,269
-Get serious!

238
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:11,736
Do I look like a puppy to you?

239
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:12,769
Ramen!

240
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:13,736
-Yeah.

241
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:14,936
I'll forgive you
for a cheeseburger.

242
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:19,203
-I guess, if it's OK,
then I'll have ramen also.

243
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:20,569
-Fair enough, then.

244
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,603
Right this way.

245
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:25,003
Ramen and a cheeseburger
from that place?

246
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,969
When pigs fly.

247
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,403
-Hey old guy!

248
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:29,836
What about miso ramen with pork?

249
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:30,936
-Fine by me.

250
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:31,903
Have whatever you like.

251
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,069
-So, where the
heck are we going?

252
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:48,436
Man, we're not even
in the town anymore.

253
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,203
Hey!

254
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,569
I don't see any ramen shop.

255
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:56,936
-This should do.

256
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:07,936
I don't see a ramen shop either.

257
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:12,203
Guess I'll just have to
forget about my treating you.

258
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:14,536
Would've been a tasty last meal.

259
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,703
I'm sorry you're gonna miss it.

260
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:17,569
-What are you saying?

261
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:34,137
-This is the end of the line.

262
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,437
You kids are going
to die out here.

263
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:37,871
-Now wait a sec!

264
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,237
What's the big idea?

265
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,437
-Well, you three kids
know Gosunkugi is here,

266
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:44,571
and that is a right fatal fact.

267
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,037
-Yeah?

268
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:45,737
So what?

269
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,737
Why does it matter?

270
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:49,604
-Gosunkugi is my prey.

271
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:50,971
Mine alone.

272
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,504
I'm not handing him over
to you or anyone else.

273
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:54,871
-Well, good for you.

274
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,804
So why don't you go catch him
already and leave us alone?

275
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,237
-Sorry.

276
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,071
Wet behind the ears
though you may still be,

277
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:04,671
it doesn't change the fact
any that you're Leaf ninja.

278
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:07,637
It's better to have
fewer competitors.

279
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,871
Best to have none whatsoever.

280
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:12,804
-Don't do this.

281
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:13,304
-Now.

282
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:22,304
-Hinata!

283
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:23,737
-You rat!

284
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,637
-Naruto, help!

285
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:27,104
-Ninja Art, Beast Mimicry!

286
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:29,837
All Fours Jutsu!

287
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,771
-Ain't that a sight?

288
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,271
Your move.

289
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,237
-I'm way faster than this guy.

290
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,004
Darn it.

291
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:45,904
Where'd you go?

292
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,404
-You're too slow.

293
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:56,804
Just you and me, son.

294
00:14:56,837 --> 00:15:00,271
We gonna do this the
easy way or the hard way?

295
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:02,004
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

296
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,271
-Bravo.

297
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,337
-You're gonna pay for
this, you hear me?

298
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,771
-This ends now!

299
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:24,137
-Up here!

300
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:32,471
Now, gotcha!

301
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,837
-Well, almost had me there.

302
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:45,304
Forgive me, kid.

303
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:47,371
I did what I had to do.

304
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,804
I'll defeat him
whatever the cost.

305
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:20,004
[barking]

306
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:22,571
-Akamaru.

307
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:23,537
-Aw, man.

308
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,904
For an old guy, he
kicked our butts.

309
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:28,237
Hinata, are you
feeling all right?

310
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:30,904
-Uh, yeah.

311
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:33,071
-Where is Sazanami?

312
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,271
-Huh?

313
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,071
Could he have gone
after Gosunkugi?

314
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,704
-What are we just
sitting here for?

315
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:39,604
I'm not letting him
beat us to the draw.

316
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:47,204
-Ugh.

317
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:47,971
Come on.

318
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:49,137
Where did that old guy go?

319
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,804
[barking]

320
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:55,504
-What do you think?

321
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,404
Figure he skipped town by now?

322
00:16:57,437 --> 00:17:00,704
-Going after Gosunkugi.

323
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,104
[barking]

324
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:03,437
-We're counting on you, Akamaru.

325
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:38,037
-I'm hunting bigger game,
but I don't see him.

326
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:40,071
GOSUKUGI: Quiet, you
opportunistic hyena.

327
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:50,637
-I waited a long time for
you to make your move.

328
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,671
-Unfortunately, I
have an important task

329
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:55,537
that needs attending to.

330
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:59,037
Time is money, so let's kill
you as cheaply as possible.

331
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:13,637
Ninja Art.

332
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:14,871
Torpedo Nail.

333
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:17,137
-Gosunkugi-- it's over.

334
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,704
-Should've watched your step.

335

[shout]

336
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,204
-It's over.

337
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:45,071
Now finish him off!

338
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,304
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

339
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,204
Gosunkugi, we're placing
you under arrest!

340
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:56,504
-Curses.

341
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,237
Reinforcements.

342
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,171
Retreat!

343
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,171
-Not so fast!

344
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:03,171
SAZANAMI: Wait.

345
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:03,671
-Huh?

346
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:08,771
-Don't go.

347
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:10,571
It'll be the death of you.

348
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,571
-Old guy!

349
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:17,737
You alive?

350
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:18,304
Hey.

351
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:20,871
Sazanami!

352
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,604
-Don't you go after him.

353
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:25,737
He's too strong for you three.

354
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:46,337
-How could such a tough
old coot get beaten?

355
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:47,704
-Think about it.

356
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,471
Gosunkugi isn't
just another thief.

357
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:54,104
He's a shinobi, same as us.

358
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:54,771
-A shinobi, huh?

359
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,237
-Sazanami!

360
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:08,737
Huh?

361
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:21,071
-So are you one of
Gosunkugi's goons?

362
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:26,004
I remember you.

363
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,937
You were at that tavern.

364
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:29,371
Yeah, sitting at the table!

365
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:38,371
-Man, what was that
guy's problem, anyway?

366
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,037
Huh?

367
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,537
What's this?

368
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,071
A wanted flier?

369
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,171
-What a dummy.

370
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,904
I mean, none of us even
look like Gosunkugi.

371
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:48,837
-Naw, man.

372
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:51,371
It's somebody else.

373
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:54,404
This fugitive who
calls himself Tokichi

374
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:58,604
is a murderer known to have
killed a family of three.

375
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,171
He has a bird-shaped
birthmark on his chest.

376
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:03,004
-A bird-shaped birthmark?

377
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:04,971
It couldn't be--

378
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:05,637
-Hinata?

379
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:06,837
What is it?

380
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:10,571
-His face is covered with
scars, so I can't tell.

381
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,437
but he has a birthmark--
shaped like a bird.

382
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:19,604
-So there's a bounty
on the bounty hunter?

383
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,771
-Man, could this
mission get any weirder?

384
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:22,837
What's going on?

385

NARUTO: A long time
ago, but not really,

387
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:07,969
on an overcast,
clear day, a day that

388
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:10,069
was night right from
the start, the righteous

389
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:13,702
rogue Sazanami's past
unwinds and frays!

390
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:16,035
Ah, Gosunkugi, the fatal foe.

391
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,869
Though the truth is uncovered,
sometimes a shinobi's

392
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,069
gotta do what a
shinobi's gotta do.

393
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:22,702
Hey, Gosunkugi!

394
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,569
Give yourself up, or else!

395
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:28,269
Next time, Hunt or be Hunted,
Showdown at the OK Temple.
