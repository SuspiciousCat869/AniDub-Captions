[music playing]

2
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,468
-This is a custom
in which balance

3
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:49,937
is preserved by
fighting and dying.

4
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,008
In the world of the
Shinobi, that is friendship.

5
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,078
The third exam is
a fight for life

6
00:01:56,111 --> 00:02:01,317
with the pride of your village
and your own dreams at stake.

7
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,586
-Well, he sure convinced me.

8
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,088
-Any test is fine.

9
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:08,024
Just tell me what the details
of the exam are already.

10
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:11,328
I can handle anything
you throw at me.

11
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,664
-Very well then.

12
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:13,998
Now listen closely.

13
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,667
I'm going to tell you
exactly what you'll all

14
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,169
be doing on the third exam.

15
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:24,277
-Lord Hokage, before you do,
please allow me, Hayate Gekko,

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,112
to speak first.

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,248
-So be it.

18
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:33,288
-There's something I
would like all of you

19
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,823
to do before the third exam.

20
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,933
We have to have a
preliminary exam

21
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,304
before we can move
on to the real one.

22
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:49,172
-Huh?

23
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:50,608
A what?

24
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,675
-Preliminary?

25
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,611
Just what do you mean by that?

26
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,046
-I'm sorry.

27
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,950
Sensei, excuse me, but I
really don't see the point.

28
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:00,152
What's this
preliminary all about?

29
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:04,557
Why can't we just move
on to the third exam?

30
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,494
-Well, you see, the
first and second exams

31
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:08,962
might have been too easy.

32
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:11,733
The fact is, we never
expected so many of you

33
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,067
to still be here.

34
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,303
According to the rules
of the Chunin Exams,

35
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:18,206
a preliminary round can be
held at any stage in order

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,210
to reduce the number of
candidates remaining.

37
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,446
-But is that fair?

38
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,914
-It's just that
at this stage, we

39
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:27,317
have to speed things up a bit.

40
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:30,420
As Lord Hokage said, a
lot of important guests

41
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:31,622
will be watching.

42
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:34,024
We can't afford to
waste their time.

43
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,928
They've come to
see only the best.

44
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:38,296
So if there are
any of you who feel

45
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,832
you're not in top
physical condition,

46
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,135
now's your chance to--

47
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,406
-Talk about not being in
top physical condition.

48
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,243
-That proctor doesn't
look so good himself.

49
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,612
-Sorry about that.

50
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:55,049
As I was saying, any of you who
don't feel up to this, now's

51
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,352
the time for you to bow out.

52
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,754
The preliminaries will
be starting immediately.

53
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,791
-Come on, you mean right now?

54
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,360
-We just finished barely
surviving the last exam.

55
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,262
Don't we get a break?

56
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,099
-Man, what a drag.

57
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:10,367
When do we eat?

58
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:15,307
-Narrowing the Field:

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,641
Sudden Death Elimination!

60
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:21,847
Well, they pulled a fast one.

61
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,848
But I'm in.

62
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:24,851
All the way, no matter what.

63
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:29,223
I gave my word to Kabuto.

64
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:30,590
-Oh yeah.

65
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:33,594
The winners will be determined
by one-on-one combat,

66
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:35,062
sudden death.

67
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,432
So like I said, if there's
anyone who doesn't feel up

68
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:40,302
to it, now's the time
to raise your hand.

69
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:45,241
-Does he really think
anyone's going to quit?

70
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:45,842
-Sasuke?

71
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:52,516
-Waves of pain, they're
coming sooner and sooner.

72
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,152
-Oh no.

73
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,588
I knew it.

74
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,290
Sasuke, listen to me.

75
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:01,226
You have got to quit.

76
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,261
-Huh?

77
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:03,696
-You've been like
this ever since you

78
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,030
tangled with Orochimaru.

79
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:08,301
And it's getting worse.

80
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:12,539
It's that mark he
put on you, isn't it?

81
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,141
-Mark?

82
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,643
-You can't deny it, Sasuke.

83
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,789
-I just gave him a
little parting gift.

84
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:28,625
Sasuke will definitely
seek me out.

85
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:30,394
He'll desire my power.

86
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:51,451
-It looks like you're
the only one left.

87
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,586
-Please.

88
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,588
-Huh?

89
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:59,961
-Please, Sasuke, quit now
before-- I don't know what.

90
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:02,364
I'm scared.

91
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:02,965
-Sakura.

92
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:10,841
-It's just as I feared.

93
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:12,476
-What do we do with him?

94
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,212
-We take him out of the exam,
hand him over to black ops,

95
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:17,281
and let them keep him locked up.

96
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,417
We have to keep that
seal under control.

97
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:23,589
-And he's just going to quietly
go along with all of this, huh?

98
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,158
You really think so?

99
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,628
You're forgetting, he's
of the Uchiha Clan.

100
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:29,996
-I don't care what
the heck he is.

101
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,799
If he stays, he's a
danger to everyone.

102
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:34,101
Don't you see?

103
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,703
As he gets stronger,
so does the curse mark.

104
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:38,373
That thing is feeding
off his chakra.

105
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:43,445
It's a forbidden Jutsu that
devours the one who bears it.

106
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,817
It's incredible the
kid is still standing.

107
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,887
By now, he should be dead.

108
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,688
Lord Hokage.

109
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,294
-Come on, you know
as well as I do.

110
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:58,129
We are in no condition
to keep on fighting.

111
00:06:58,162 --> 00:06:59,363
-Shut up, Sakura.

112
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,933
-You think I'm
blind or something?

113
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:03,502
-Will you please be quiet?

114
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:07,440
-You think I don't see the
suffering you're going through?

115
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:09,409
-That's enough, Sakura.

116
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,343
-I'm sorry.

117
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,913
I can't let you
do it to yourself.

118
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:15,883
I'm going to tell
them about that mark.

119
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,184
Then maybe you'll--

120
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:21,157
-Hm.

121
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:24,460
-What the?

122
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:29,766
-OK.

123
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,567
You got me.

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,234
I'm out.

125
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,740
-But Kabuto--

126
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:47,720
-Kabuto Yakushi of the
Leaf Village, right?

127
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:48,721
OK.

128
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:49,922
You can go on and step back.

129
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:52,559
-Gotcha.

130
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:53,493
-Kabuto!

131
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:54,628
Hold on a second!

132
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,996
You can't quit.

133
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,064
I don't get this.

134
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,334
What's going on?

135
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:02,637
-Pathetic.

136
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:04,073
-Oh, Naruto.

137
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:07,977
I'm sorry, but my
body's just too beat up.

138
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,247
I can't hack it.

139
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:14,818
The fact is, ever since
orientation and that dust up

140
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,587
with the sound
village team, I've

141
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,157
had no hearing at
all in my left ear.

142
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,560
And now to have to put
my life on the line,

143
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:25,731
to fight again right
away without a break?

144
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,799
I can't do it.

145
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,477
-Seems to me I've
seen that one before.

146
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:40,715
If memory serves, this
isn't the first time

147
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:42,951
he's dropped out
before a battle.

148
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:46,989
What kind of game is he playing?

149
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:47,723
-Anko.

150
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:48,624
-Oh, right.

151
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:53,663
Kabuto Yakushi.

152
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:58,001
Says here he's failed
six times in a row.

153
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:01,305
-What do you have
on his background?

154
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,010
-His time at the academy was
not what you'd call impressive.

155
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,578
Average grades.

156
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,948
Took him a full three tries
before he passed the graduation

157
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,383
exam.

158
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,352
As far as the missions he's
carried out since then,

159
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,656
there's been two C
ranks and 14 D ranks.

160
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:20,461
It's not exactly a battle
record to write home about.

161
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:22,630
However--

162
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:23,831
-Go on.

163
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:27,002
-There's something before
his time in the academy.

164
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:28,371
-Huh?

165
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:30,473
-Do you remember the child?

166
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:34,110
The one who was found after
the Battle of Kikyo Pass?

167
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,881
The only survivor.

168
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:38,583
-I remember the story.

169
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,485
It was said a
small boy was found

170
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,921
among the enemy dead
on the battlefield.

171
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:46,157
He was found barely alive
and brought back by a Jonin

172
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,526
from the medical unit.

173
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,830
You're saying this is that boy?

174
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:53,333
-Kabuto, what do you
think you're doing anyway?

175
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:57,370
Have you forgotten
Orochimaru's orders?

176
00:09:57,404 --> 00:09:59,973
-I'm leaving all that to you.

177
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,709
What's the problem?

178
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:05,247
For someone with your abilities,
it should be no trouble.

179
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,853
This is your chance to
prove yourself, Yoroi.

180
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:14,625
After all, you've always wanted
to take my place, haven't you?

181
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:16,427
Go for it.

182
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,162
-You may be
Orochimaru's favorite,

183
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:21,666
but be careful you
don't push it too far.

184
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:22,934
-Thanks for the advice.

185
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:23,935
I'll keep it in mind.

186
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,613
-Huh?

187
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,214
-Sorry, Naruto.

188
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,417
Sorry, Sasuke.

189
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:41,188
Wish I could stick around
and play a little longer.

190
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:46,995
But if I did that, the old
me might get stirred up.

191
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:48,764
Can't have that.

192
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,632
Might blow my cover.

193
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,471
Wouldn't be much use
as a spy after that.

194
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:57,407
Besides, I've
already done my job.

195
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,843
With you here looking after
things, you don't need me,

196
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:03,147
do you, Lord Orochimaru?

197
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:06,318
Guess I'll just have to
save my fun for later.

198
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:09,288
Until we meet again, Sasuke.

199
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:13,058
Oh, and you too,
of course, Naruto.

200
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,663
-Now then, does anybody
else want to quit?

201
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:37,735
-I can't let this go on.

202
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:39,136
I have to tell them.

203
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,680
-Don't you even think of
telling them about this mark.

204
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:58,025
-I don't get what
you're trying to prove.

205
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:00,761
Am I supposed to just stand
by and watch you tear yourself

206
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:01,830
apart?

207
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,998
I can't bear to watch it.

208
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,100
-Then don't watch.

209
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:08,270
But stay out of it.

210
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,072
This has nothing to do with you.

211
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,481
I told you before.

212
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:25,123
What I am is an avenger.

213
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:28,494
For me, this is something
far more than just an exam.

214
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:32,431
Whether I become a Chunin or not
means less than nothing to me.

215
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:38,205
Am I as strong as I can be?

216
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:41,276
All I want is the
answer to that.

217
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:45,847
I can only find out by fighting
the strongest, the best.

218
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:49,718
-My name is Gaara of the desert.

219
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,654
-Hey you, over here.

220
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,855
What's your name?

221
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,724
-Accept it.

222
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,727
You have no chance against me.

223
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,829
Your skills are inferior.

224
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,398
-For the moment, we're even.

225
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,301
But if it should happen that
we ever meet again in combat,

226
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:06,271
I promise you we
won't run or hide.

227
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:10,042
-And the best of the
best are all here.

228
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:17,117
This is the path I walk.

229
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,522
Not you or anyone
can change that.

230
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:22,957
-Oh, Sasuke.

231
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,726
-Man, you don't
know when to quit.

232
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,162
What are you butting your
head up for, you idiot?

233
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:29,264
It's just because
she cares about you.

234
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:29,732
-Naruto.

235
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:31,968
-Huh?

236
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:35,405
-You're one of the ones
I want to fight the most.

237
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,187
-Huh?

238
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,419
-I'm still concerned about
what all Orochimaru said.

239
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,156
Allow the boy to continue
with the exam for now,

240
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,657
-and we'll see what happens.
-What?!

241
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,426
-But Lord Hokage--

242
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,230
-However, at the first sign
of the curse mark growing

243
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:59,166
or his power getting
out of control,

244
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,834
he will step in and stop it.

245
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:01,769
-Right.

246
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:06,240
-But-- as you wish.

247
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:14,517
-All right, then.

248
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,188
We will now begin the
preliminary round.

249
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:22,694
This round will consist of
one-on-one individual combat

250
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,196
at full battle intensity.

251
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,965
This is not an exercise.

252
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,968
There are 20 of you
remaining, so that

253
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,737
means we will need ten matches.

254
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,974
The surviving candidates
from these ten matches

255
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,243
will advance to the third exam.

256
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,313
As for the rules,
there are none.

257
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:43,150
You will fight until one dies or
concedes defeat or is rendered

258
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:46,154
physically incapable of
continuing the contest.

259
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:47,723
Naturally, those
who are losing are

260
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:51,560
urged to concede defeat promptly
to avoid a fatal outcome.

261
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:54,531
Furthermore, as proctor,
I'm given a certain amount

262
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:56,266
of leeway in
judging the matches.

263
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:01,439
I might occasionally
intervene if a match seems

264
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:04,976
hopeless to save as
many lives as possible.

265
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:08,480
Now it's time to reveal what
fate has been chosen for you.

266
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:12,484
-Open the panel.

267
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:25,132
-The names of each
pair of opponents

268
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,835
are chosen completely at random.

269
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:30,005
Before each match,
these names will

270
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:33,776
appear on the display behind me.

271
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,713
As there's nothing more
to say, let's begin.

272
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,449
In a moment, the names of
the first two opponents

273
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:40,590
will appear.

274
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,285
YOROI AKADO VS SASUKUE UCHIHA

275
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,769
-Didn't waste any
time, did they?

276
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,943
-I couldn't ask
for anything more.

277
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:03,977
-No!

278
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,347
Why did it have to be Sasuke?

279
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,690
-All right now.

280
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,926
Those whose names have
been drawn, come forward.

281
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,004
-You have been chosen for
the first match, Yoroi Akado

282
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:29,875
and Sasuke Uchiha.

283
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,576
Are there any objections?

284
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,011
-None here.

285
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:33,612
-No.

286
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,128
-Wow, that's it.

287
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:50,498
All I can do now is watch.

288
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:55,805
-You better win, Sasuke, if
you ever hope to take me on.

289
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,707
-Something is wrong.

290
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,377
He's acting strangely.

291
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,013
-Could it be the curse mark?

292
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:06,384
-Sasuke, good luck.

293
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,687
-Now we just sit back
and see what happens.

294
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,461
-The pain won't go away.

295
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:19,933
-That curse mark
giving you trouble?

296
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:21,267
-All right then.

297
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:22,669
Let's begin the first match.

298
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:26,841
OK.

299
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,610
Everyone other than the
two opposing candidates

300
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:31,413
will now clear the area and
move to the upper level.

301
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:42,659
-Hey!

302
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:45,830
Kakashi Sensei!

303
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:46,431
-Sasuke.

304
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,336
Don't use your Sharingan.

305
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,474
-So you know about it?

306
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,245
-If that mark on your
neck gets out of control,

307
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,083
your life could be in danger.

308
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,785
-I'm aware of that.

309
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,388
-Just to let you know,
if it gets to that point,

310
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,058
I'll have to step in
and stop the fight.

311
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,893
Good luck.

312
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:12,961
-Stop the fight?

313
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:19,835
This thing, it seems to be
responding to my chakra.

314
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,280
Got to try.

315
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:33,251
Use the last of my chakra.

316
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:36,855
Sharingan!

317
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,859
[screams]

318
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:40,694
-Sasuke, please!

319
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,228
Stop using your Sharingan!

320
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,463
Don't do it!

321
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,834
-Every time I use my
chakra, this thing

322
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,603
gets a little stronger.

323
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:52,007
It gains a little
more control over me.

324
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,743
I've got to fight him without
using my Sharingan,

325
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:57,947
and even my own
Jutsu is off limits.

326
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,550
Maybe I can make him
laugh himself to death.

327
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:08,259
-The thing is, Sasuke,
Yoroi's unique skills

328
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,494
are going to be
disastrous for you.

329
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,003
-Whatever.

330
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,472
Let's get on with this.

331
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:33,188
-Watch yourself, Sasuke.

332
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:35,357
Don't push it.

333
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,026
-Then if you're ready,
let the match begin.

334
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,396
-Oh, I'm ready.

335
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,031
-So am I.

336
00:19:59,085 --> 00:19:59,652
Already?

337
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:04,892
-Huh?

338
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,901
-Hey, he got him!

339
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:13,502
-Really?

340
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,178
-What's happening?

341
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:37,262
All my strength,
suddenly it's gone.

342
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,835
-Sasuke, no!

343
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,326
-[laughs]

344
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,522
-Sasuke!

345
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,426
-What the-- my chakra,
what are you doing?

346
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,595
-[laughs]

347
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,230
You're just noticing it now?

348
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:23,652
[music playing]

349
00:22:50,985 --> 00:22:54,455
-It's like fighting with both
hands tied behind my back.

350
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:58,860
If I try to defend myself, this
mark on my neck will take over.

351
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,263
But if I don't,
they'll call the match

352
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,099
and give Yoroi the victory.

353
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,301
That is, if he
doesn't kill me first.

354
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,471
Either way, my whole purpose
for being here is lost.

355
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:09,940
I've got to find a way.

356
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,576
I can't let it end like this!

357
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,085
Next time, Bushy Brow's
Jealousy- Lions Barrage

358
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,719
Unleashed!
