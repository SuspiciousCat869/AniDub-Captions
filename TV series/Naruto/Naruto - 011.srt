TAZUNA: You always is lazy?

4
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:10,626
Where's that weird blonde kid
and the one with the attitude?

5
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,761
-They're training
climbing trees.

6
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,397
-To tough for you?

7
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,298
-No.

8
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,700
In fact, I'm the best.

9
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:21,405
That's why the sensei
sent me here to guard you.

10
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:22,139
-You're joking.

11
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:30,248
-Tazuna, uh, I need
to talk to you.

12
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:30,981
-Uh?

13
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:31,916
What about?

14
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:34,185
-The thing is,
I've been thinking

15
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,021
a lot about the bridge.

16
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:39,224
And I decided I've push
my luck far enough.

17
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:40,426
I want out.

18
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,162
-Now you're going to quit
on me, just like that?

19
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,931
You're kidding!

20
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,334
-You know, I stayed on
because of our friendship.

21
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:51,170
But I'm putting my life on the
line every day I stayed here.

22
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:53,906
Gato and his thugs will
show up eventually.

23
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,608
-Hmm.

24
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,911
-When they do, they'll
kill you and the bridge

25
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,914
will never get finished anyway.

26
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,783
It's a lost cause, Tazuna.

27
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,518
Why don't we stop now
while we can still

28
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,819
get out of this alive?

29
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:13,595
-No chance.

30
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,165
This is our bridge.

31
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:19,301
Our island is poor, and
it will stay that way

32
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:22,071
until this bridge connects
us to the mainland.

33
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:24,440
Commerce, trade,
and hope-- that's

34
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,808
what we're building here.

35
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,379
-There's not going to be
much if we're all dead.

Let's break for lunch.

00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:37,354
-Tazuna, let's not
end it like this.

-Save your breath.

00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:43,194
Oh, and Giichi, don't bother
coming back after lunch.

00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:54,762
Uhh!

00:03:58,344 --> 00:03:59,545
Why is it so hard?

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I'm not
going to lose out to you.

00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,986
-Um, where are we going?

-You want to eat
tonight, don't cha?

48
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:42,892
I got to pick up some
things for dinner.

wrong with these people?

SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
This is a store?

55
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:14,294
There's nothing here.

56
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,662
-Hehe.

57
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:17,863

surprised me back there.

61
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,343

don't fight like that.

-They should.

00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,046
Something's
seriously wrong here.

64
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:35,517
Again!

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,518
Hey, buster!

66
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:42,124
-Please?

[giggling]

68
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,337
-Hmm.

69
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,706
Uhh, here.

70
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:01,278
-Aw, thank you.

71
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,487
TAZUNA: This is how it's
been since Gato came here.

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,156
The children suffer.

73
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:13,992
And the adults are afraid
to stand up to him.

74
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,799
They've lost all hope.

75
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,435
That's why we have
to finish the bridge.

76
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:25,371
It will bring
commerce and trade.

77
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:29,008
But much more importantly, that
bridge is a symbol of courage.

78
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,078
We must restore the
spirit of our people.

79
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:38,619
When the bridge is
finished, people

80
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:42,456
will start to believe again.

81
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,060
They'll believe that they
can live with dignity.

82
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,496
We can't let Gato stop us.

83
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,374
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke,
Naruto, we have to help them.

84
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,762
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
He's still climbing.

85
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:20,197
That's impossible.

86
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,904
SASUKE (VOICOVER): Damn.

87
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,406
He's catching up
to be inch by inch.

88
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,678
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ahh!

89
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,112
No, no, no!

90
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:36,849
If I think about Sasuke
I'll lose my concentration.

91
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,584
Believe it.

92
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:39,618
Come on, Naruto.

93
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,621
Center yourself.

94
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,057
Hey, you're good at this.

95
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,191
How about some advice?

96
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:51,198
SASUKE (VOICOVER): All right.

97
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,467
Chakra requires
spiritual energy.

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,170
So if you get all anxious
and frantic, it doesn't work.

99
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:59,440
You have to relax, and
totally focus on the tree.

100
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:01,009
That's how you get
a steady chakra

101
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,111
flow in the bottom's
of your feet.

102
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,781
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Relax, focus on the tree.

103
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,083
Yeah, I can feel it.

104
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:10,085
I'm going all the way this time.

105
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,687
SASUKE: Hey, Naruto.

106
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,125
-Sasuke, what are you doing?

107
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:18,661
I was trying to focus my chakra.

108
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:23,233
SASUKE: Well, uh, you
know, the thing is--

109
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,002
-The thing is what?

110
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,536
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's strange.

111
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,871
He never talks to me.

112
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:29,272
What's he up to?

113
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:36,347
-You-- you know you asked Sakura
for advice when she was here.

114
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,449
So what did she tell you?

115
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:43,888
-I'm not telling you.

116
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,862
[elephant trumpeting]

117
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,041
TAZUNA: Hahaha.

118
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,009
Hey, this is fantastic.

119
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,279
It's been ages since
we've had so many guests

120
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,280
around our table.

121
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,656
-(TOGETHER) I want some more.

122
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:15,257
Huh?

123
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:22,765
-Don't eat so much if
you're going to puke it up.

124
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,833
-I have to eat.

125
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,835
-And I have to be more than him.

126
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:30,239
It's the only possible way I'll
get strong enough to beat him.

127
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,440
-That's true.

128
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,743
But puking won't help you.

129
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,253
-Excuse me, this
picture is torn.

130
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,523
Is there some reason for that?

131
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:48,559
Inari, you kept glancing
at it all through dinner.

132
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,929
It looks like there was
someone else in the picture,

133
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:52,230
but they got torn out.

134
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:53,765
I mean, that's kind
of strange, isn't it?

135
00:09:59,037 --> 00:09:59,771
-It's my husband.

136
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:05,377
-They used to call him
a hero in this land.

137
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:10,517
-Inari, where are you going?

138
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,961
Father, you can't talk about
him like that in front of Inari,

139
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:21,962
you know that.

140
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:37,146
-Inari's so-- I mean,
what happened to him?

141
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,180
-Hmm.

142
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:41,451
Is there a story behind this?

143
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,018
-He wasn't his real father.

144
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:45,555
He came into our family later.

145
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,991
And he brought so
much happiness.

146
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,826
He and Inari were very close.

147
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:55,599
In those days, Inari used
to laugh all the time.

148
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:07,412
But then, all that ended.

149
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:11,383
He never laughs
or smiles anymore,

150
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,686
ever since the day
everything changed.

151
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:21,975
The word courage was
stolen from this island.

152
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,111
We were left feeling
powerless, hopeless,

153
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:28,382
and Inari suffered the
most, ever since that day,

154
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,851
ever since it happened.

155
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,086
-Tell us.

156
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:35,056
What happened to Inari?

157
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,760
-First you need to know
about the man, his father.

158
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,630
The man who taught
us the word courage,

159
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:43,765
who was a hero in this land.

160
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,334
NARUTO: A hero, really?

161
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,104
-You can decide
that for yourself.

162
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:52,842
He came here about
three years ago.

163
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,444
-Pochi!

164
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:57,847
Pochi, no!

165
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:59,116
-That's not his name.

166
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,919
Starting today his
name is Shooting Star.

167
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,787
And he's my dog now.

168
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,155
-No he's not.

169
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,158
He's my dog and his
name's not Shooting Star.

170
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,526
I've had him since
he was a puppy.

171
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,532
He's my friend, and he
doesn't belong to you.

172
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,298
-Just shut up!

173
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:21,073
[pochi howling]

174
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,414
-See what happens when
you don't listen to me?

175
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,651
Now I'm not going to lift
a finger to help him.

176
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,518
OK.

177
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,088
You can let him go.

178
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,089
-Why did you do that?

179
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,659
My dog is going to drown!

180
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,960
Ha!

181
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,795
If he's your dog, then
jump in and get him.

182
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,464
Be a big hero and
save your friend.

183
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:49,204
After all that big talk, you're
not going to let him go under,

184
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,040
are you?

185
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,514
INARI (VOICEOVER): I've got
to jump in and save him.

186
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:01,284
I've got to, but--

187
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:04,788
AKANE: Haha, he won't even
help his precious little Pochi.

188
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,591
INARI (VOICEOVER):
I, I can't swim.

189
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:09,659
And I'm scared.

190
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,261
I'm sorry, Pochi.

191
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,764
-Hey, you made such
a big deal about him.

192
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:15,733
Go get him!

193
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,508
-I think you went
too far, Akane.

194
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,411
I mean, he could really
drown or something.

195
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:27,679
-Ahh!

196
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,614
Help!

197
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:29,515
Please!

198
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,016
-Forget about it.

199
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,352
-I don't know.

200
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:36,288
-You say one more word
and you're going in next.

201
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,023
Got it?

202
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,190
-I don't want to die!

203
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,801
-Pooch!

204
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,102
Pooch!

205
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:52,305
-Interestingly enough,
at that exact moment

206
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,775
Pooch figured out
how to dog paddle.

207
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,278
[dog howling]

208
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:57,980
-Pooch!

209
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,256
-Hey, Shooting
Star's running away.

210
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,223
Get him!

211
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,436
INARI (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

212
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,437
I can't breathe.

213
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:32,349
KAIZA: Waking up, huh?

214
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:32,912
Finally.

215
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,857
I had a little talk
with those kids.

216
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,060
They won't bother you again.

217
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,395
Here, eat.

218
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,163
INARI (VOICEOVER): Am I alive?

219
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,332
Is this for real?

220
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:50,068
-Did you pull me out
of the water, mister?

221
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,704
-Have a bite to eat, first.

222
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:55,374
Then we can talk all about it.

223
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:56,275
Hm, I see.

224
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:58,211
Your dog abandoned you too, huh?

225
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:00,180
In my country, dogs
are very loyal.

226
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:02,682
They stand by their masters.

227
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:06,821
Then again, you abandoned
the dog first, so what can

228
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:09,524
you expect?

229
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:12,360
-I really wanted to save
him, but I just froze.

230
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:17,265
I was just so scared.

231
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:20,035
I guess that I just
don't have any courage.

232
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,303
-Hey, come on.

233
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,738
Don't be so hard on yourself.

234
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,972
You're a kid.

235
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,976
When I was your age,
I was scared too.

236
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,611
It's no big deal.

237
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:33,450
But always remember
this: live your life

238
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,318
so you have nothing to regret.

239
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,990
If you care about something,
protect it, no matter

240
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,694
how tough, no matter how sad,
you've got to keep trying.

241
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,564
Even if you have to put
your life on the line,

242
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:49,567
protect it with both
arms, never get in.

243
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,475
-His name was Kaiza.

244
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,443
A simple fisherman
who'd come here

245
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:01,446
from another land to
follow his dreams.

246
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,150
After that, Inari and
Kaiza were inseparable.

247
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,120
The boy had never
known his real father,

248
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:09,055
so you can imagine
what it meant to him

249
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,690
to have Kaiza in his life.

250
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:13,226
He looked up to him and
followed in his footsteps,

251
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,196
like a real father and son.

252
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,932
Kaiza spent more and
more time with us,

253
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:23,838
until he just naturally
became a member of our family.

254
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:29,311
And then when this town needed
him, he became something more.

255
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:31,279
-We've got trouble, Kaiza.

256
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:33,515
The flood gate's and
the water's rising.

257
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,652
If we don't stop it, the lower
district will be flooded.

258
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:37,653
-What?

259
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:38,421
-Father!

260
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:39,922
-Inari, get me some rope.

261
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:40,556
Hurry.

262
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:41,357
-Right.

263
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,758
MAN: See where the gate is?

264
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,828
We need to get a line out
there to pull it closed.

265
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:46,062
-A line?

266
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:47,196
You have to swim out
there to do that.

267
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,465
It's impossible.

268
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:50,534
No one can make it
through that current.

269
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:54,104
-If we don't do it, the whole
district will be wiped out.

270
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,372
It's the only way.

271
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,908
KAIZA: I'll do it.

272
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,910
MAN 1: Kaiza.

273

MAN 2: Don't be foolish.

274
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,882
MAN 3: You'll never make it.

275
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:06,284
-Father.

276
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,252
-Don't worry.

277
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:08,654
Nothing can stop your dad.

278
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,056
This is our village,
so we've got

279
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,425
to do everything we can to help.

280
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:19,799
KAIZA (VOICEOVER): If you care
about something, protect it.

281
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:33,514
Even if you have to put
your life on the line.

282
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:35,683
Protect it with both arms.

283
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:39,087
Never give in.

284
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,055
-Father, I know you can do it.

285
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:49,464
MAN 1: He made it.

286
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:50,833
He tied the rope on.

287
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:51,701
MAN 3: All right.

288
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:52,468
Let pull it closed.

289
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,871
MAN 2: Everybody, come on.

290
00:17:55,905 --> 00:18:00,243
-From that time on, Kaiza was
considered a hero in this land.

291
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:02,212
He taught us all the
meaning of courage,

292
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:06,049
and Inari was so
proud to be his son.

293
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:11,422
But it wasn't long after that
Gato showed up and took over.

294
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:13,858
He terrorized the whole village.

295
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,928
Only Kaiza stood up to him.

296
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:20,565
Gato couldn't have a local
hero getting in his way.

297
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:25,037
It took his whole
gang to stop one man.

298
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,039
GATO: You overplayed
your hand Kaiza.

299
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,874
All that talk about
how you're going

300
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,911
to protect this village
with your two arms.

301
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,248
Those arms aren't much
worth now, are they?

302
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,052
Still got that defiant
look in your eye though.

303
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,787
Well my men will
get rid of that.

304
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,792
get to work on him.

305
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,525
-Get down there.

00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:58,139

GATO: Listen up.

309
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:15,826
This man has defied
the Gato Corporation.

310
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:20,964
He has disturbed the
order of this land.

311
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,167
His punishment is execution.

312

again.

315

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,016
-Inari don't.

317
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:45,491
-Do it.

318
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:50,897
-Father, no!

00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,041

[explosion]

321

-You told me that
you'd protect me,

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,197
and this land with
both your arms.

323
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,101
You made me believe
you could do it.

324
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:27,170
But it was just a lie.

325
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,211
TAZUNA: Since then,
Inari has changed.

00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:35,312
So did Tsunami.

327
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:37,147
And all our people.

328
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:38,549
We lost our will.

329
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:44,389
-Ha. there's no such
thing as a hero.

330
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:46,592
Only stupid kids believe that.

331
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:07,080
-What are you doing
down there, Naruto?

332
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:08,616
-You better take the day off.

333
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,217
No more training.

334
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,452
You've used too much chakra.

335
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:14,155
If you push any harder,
it could kill you.

336
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,891
-I'm going to prove it.

337
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:17,826
-Prove what?

338
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,964
-I'll prove that,
that it's true.

339
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:29,905
That in this world,
there are real heroes.

340
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,313
[music: Akeboshi, "Wind"]

341
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:08,079
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Huh?

342
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:09,914
You want something lady?

343
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:11,583
I'm in training
right now, because we

344
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,652
don't know when Zabuza
will strike next.

345
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,756
See, I got the message
loud and clear.

346
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,991
You have to protect
you care about,

347
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,794
but to do that you
have to be strong.

348
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:23,763
I'm getting stronger every day.

349
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:26,566
I'll show Inari there
are heroes in this world.

350
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,069
Next time-- Battle
On the Bridge!

351
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:30,621
Zabuza Returns!

352
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:33,021
I'm going to kick
more butt than ever.

353
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,888
Believe it.
