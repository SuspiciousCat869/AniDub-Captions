Agh!

-I'm telling you this
because you don't get it.

You think you get
it, which is not

Another substitution jutsu.

And now, he knows
where I'm hiding.

caught Sakura with it.

That was ninjutsu, the

You have talent,
and you are right.

You are different
from the others.

But different isn't
always better.

They say "the nail
that sticks up

then we don't get any lunch.

there's nothing he could do.

00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:16,625
That doesn't leave much time.

173
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:20,162
-Sasuke, you're still trying
to get one of those bells?

174
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,098
-A while ago, I touched one.

175
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:25,001
Next time, I'll get one.

176
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:26,770
-That is really great.

177
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,105
I can't believe you did that.

178
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,774
You're amazing.

179
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:30,742
I can't believe it!

180
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,078
He touched one of the bells!

181
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,980
I'll never get my hands
on one of those things,

182
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,915
which means Sasuke
will pass and I won't.

183
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,150
And we'll be separated forever!

184
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,053
No, no, no, no, no!

185
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,322
Uhh, it's almost lunch.

186
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,958
There is not really
enough time left.

187
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:47,697
So maybe we should just give up,
and then try again next year.

188
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,698
-[grunts]

189
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:55,239
-Hmm.

190
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,497
-I'm the only one who
can destroy that person.

191
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,070
-What?

192
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,306
Who?

193
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,875
You mean the sensei?

194
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,914
-That day, I was crying.

195
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:30,818
-When were you crying?

196
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,121
-It was my--

197
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,056
-What?

198
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,159
What happened to you?

199
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,793
-I am an avenger.

200
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:42,065
That means I must be
stronger than my prey.

201
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,166
I need this training.

202
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,437
There's no time for setbacks.

203
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,839
-Uhh.

204
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:52,779
-I'm going to restore my clan
and destroy a certain someone.

205
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:55,382
[alarm clock rings]

206
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,182
Ugh.

207
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,787
I've wasted too much time.

208
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,388
-Sasuke.

209
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,427
[stomach growling]

210
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,303
-Uh-oh, stomach's growling, huh?

211
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,072
That's too bad.

212
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,908
Oh, by the way,
about this exercise?

213
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:22,148
Well, I've decided I won't send
any of you back to the academy.

214
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,151
-Aah, hah!

215
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:24,952
-What?

216
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,120
I passed?

217
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,189
All I did was faint
and fall over.

218
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:30,092
Do you get points for that?

219
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,594
Love wins out!

220
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,496
Cha cha cha!

221
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,798
-Hm.

222
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,999
-Yay!

223
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:38,635
-Then, then that means
all three of us-- I mean,

224
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:39,938
all three of us?

225
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,407
-Yes.

226
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,177
All three of you are being
dropped from the program.

227
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,078
Permanently!

228
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:47,046
-Uh?

229
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:47,680
-Huh?

230
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:48,156
-Aah!

231
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,423
MALE SPEAKER: Unbelievable!

232
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,827
Kakashi has never
passed a single student.

233
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,662
He fails all of them.

234
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,432
-Iruka, this group is young.

235
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:08,204
Even I cannot see if it is good
for them to face the rigors

236
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:10,373
and dangers of ninja life.

237
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:14,412
However, Kakashi was correct
about all those he failed.

238
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,646
-Hm.

239
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,881
-Drop us from the program?

240
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,783
That means we can
never become ninja.

241
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,320
You said if we couldn't
take the bells,

242
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,988
we'd be sent back
to the academy.

243
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,224
You can't just change
your mind and kick us out!

244
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,492
Why would you do that?

245
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,528
-Because you don't
think like ninja.

246
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,666
You think like little
kids-- like brats.

247
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,537
-[grunts]

248
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,538
-Haah!

249
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,874
-Sasuke!

250
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,644
-You think it's all about you.

251
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,911
-[grunts]

252
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,180
-Let go of Sasuke!

253
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,083
You can't step on
him like he's a bug!

254
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:50,357
-You don't know what
it means to be a ninja.

255
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,460
You think it's a game, huh?

256
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:53,427
-Uhh.

257
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,163
-Oh.

258
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:57,532
-Why do you think we
put you on squads?

259
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,270
Did you consider that
question for one moment?

260
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:02,538
-Uh, I don't know what you mean?

261
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:07,078
-I mean, you never realized
what this exercise is all about.

262
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,512
Not even close.

263
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,182
-What it's about?

264
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:14,520
-Yes, that's what determines
whether you pass or fail.

265
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:17,924
-But that's-- I mean, I wanted
to ask you about that from

266
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:18,993
the beginning.

267
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:19,894
-Tch.

268
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,262
Use your head.

269
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,464
Three people on a squad.

270
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,702
Why do you think
we would do that?

271
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,237
-Aah!

272
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,273
How are we supposed to know
why you picked three people?

273
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,742
We didn't make the rules.

274
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,544
-It's so basic.

275
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,814
Teamwork!

276
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,081
-It means working together.

277
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,182
Is that what you mean?

278
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,852
-That's what I mean.

279
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,254
It's too late now.

280
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,456
But if all three of
you would come at me,

281
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,893
you might have been
able to take them.

282
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,998
Well, anyway, it's over.

283
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,467
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Wait a minute.

284
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,470
-You set it up with three
people but only two bells.

285
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:57,507
If we worked together and
got the bells, only two of us

286
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,543
could keep them.

287
00:13:58,576 --> 00:13:59,777
And that would lead
to group conflict.

288
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,847
And the squad would break up.

289
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,148
-Exactly.

290
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,885
I purposely pitted you
against each other.

291
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,753
-Hm.

292
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,322
-Huh?

293
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,325
KAKASHI: I wanted to see if
you could overcome that and put

294
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:14,528
the squad ahead of
yourselves, A Genin should

295
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,065
have a natural
feel for teamwork.

296
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:20,703
But you-- it never
even crossed your mind.

297
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:24,408
Sakura, you obsessed
about Sasuke who was gone;

298
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:26,443
while Naruto was
right in front of you,

299
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,546
and you wouldn't lift
a finger to help him.

300
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,682
-Uhh.

301
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:33,486
KAKASHI: Naruto, you do
everything on your own.

302
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,821
Everything.

303
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:38,326
And you Sasuke thought the
others were so far beneath you,

304
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,995
they were worthless.

305
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,262
Arrogance.

306
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,565
Ninja missions are
carried out in squads.

307
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,567
Of course, you need
individual skills.

308
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,371
But teamwork is the
most essential element.

309
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,674
Every shinobi understands this.

310
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,644
When individuals put
themselves above the squad,

311
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:56,548
this can lead to
failure and death.

312
00:14:56,581 --> 00:15:03,790
For example, Sakura, kill
Naruto now or Sasuke dies.

313
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:06,093
[both gasp]

314
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,594
That's what happens
on a mission.

315
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:11,934
-Oh, boy.

316
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,102
That was really scary.

317
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,570
-[sighs]

318
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,440
-The enemy takes a
hostage, and you've

319
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,276
got an impossible choice.

320
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:21,212
And someone ends up dead.

321
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:25,084
On every mission, your
life is on the line.

322

-[grunts]

323
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,994
-Did you look at this stone,
the names engraved on it?

324
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,029
They are all ninja
who are honored

325
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:38,234
as heroes in our village.

326
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:40,203
-That's it, that's
it, that's it!

327
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:41,805
Now, I know!

328
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:44,741
I've decided I'm going to have
my name engraved on that stone.

329
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,444
I'm not going to live and
die for nothing like a dog.

330
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:49,081
I'm going to be a hero!

331
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,983
A hero!

332
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,787
-They are a special
kind of hero.

333
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,888
-Huh?

334
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,423
What kind of heroes are they?

335
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,792
Come on, tell us.

336
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,029
Well?

337
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:01,997
Well?

338
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,233
KAKASHI: They're all KIA.

339
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:05,134
-Ooh.

340
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,504
That sounds real cool.

341
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:09,039
-It means "killed in action."

342
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:10,474
They all died.

343
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,443
-Huh?

344
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,779
Uhh.

345
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:17,750
Oh.

346
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,519
-Hm.

347
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,722
-This is a memorial stone.

348
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:25,993
The names of my closest
friends are engraved here.

349
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:26,593
-Oh.

350
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,436
-[grunts]

351
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,780
-All right, I'm going to
give you one more chance.

352
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,350
But I'm going to make
it much harder on you.

353
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,618
You'll have three
hours to get a bell.

354
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,022
Eat lunch now to
build up strength.

355
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,325
But Naruto doesn't get any.

356
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,660
-[grunts]

357
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,563
-It's your punishment
for breaking the rules

358
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,798
and trying to eat by yourself.

359
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,170
And if anyone tries to
feed him, that person

360
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,772
will immediately fail.

361
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,607
-Nyaah.

362
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,777
-Hm.

363
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,680
-I make the rules.

364
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:09,248
You follow them.

365
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,717
Got it?

366
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,853
-I'm leaving.

367
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,922
-Iruka, listen to me.

368
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:17,458
-Huh?

369
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:20,829
-Whether they pass or fail,
you must not blame Kakashi.

370
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:23,965
-Right.

371
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:32,911
[stomach growls]

372
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:33,912
-Huh?

373
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:37,450
[stomach growls]

374
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,752
-This is no big deal.

375
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,154
I can go without eating
for days, for weeks.

376
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,155
Believe it!

377
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,191
This is no big deal.

378
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,793
[stomach growls]

379
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:49,131
No problem.

380
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:50,333
-Hm.

381
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:52,601
-Mm.

382
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,237
-Here.

383
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,238
-Huh?

384
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:56,273
-What?

385
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:57,742
No, Sasuke, you can't do that.

386
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,444
You heard what the sensei said.

387
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,279
-Kakashi's gone.

388
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,582
We need to get those
bells as a team.

389
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,587
If Naruto's hungry, he'll
be weak and ineffective.

390
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,890
That hurts the team and
jeopardizes the mission.

391
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,791
-Um.

392
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,075
-Sasuke.

393
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,767
[gulps]

394
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,802
Uhh.

395
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,040
-Sakura?

396
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:26,612
-Hm.

397
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,854
-OK, thanks.

398
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:35,922
-Don't thank me.

399
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,158
Just hurry up and eat.

400
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,960
-But isn't that your lunch?

401
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,496
-Uh, I'm on a diet.

402
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:42,831
I mean, I don't eat
at as much as Sasuke.

403
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,735
So, uhh, just take it, Naruto!

404
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,507
-I can't take it because
I can't move my hands.

405
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,441
You've got to feed me.

406
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:51,409
-Huh?

407
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,443
-Hurry up.

408
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,313
He could come back any minute.

409
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,917
-[grunts] This is one time only.

410
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,683
That's it!

411
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,185
I'll never do this again.

412
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,521
Is that clear?

413
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:04,158
-Clear as a bell, Sakura.

414
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:07,363
Ah, hm, mmm.

415
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,297
-[grunts]

416
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,969
-You!

417
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,938
-Aah!

418
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,341
-Aah!

419
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,308
-Ugh.

420
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:18,910
-You broke the rules.

421
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,812
I hope you're ready
for the punishment.

422
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:28,589
Any last words?

423
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:33,362
-[whimpers]

424
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,332
-[whimpers] But you said--

425
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:37,734
-Yes?

426
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,736
-You said that there
were three of us.

427
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,704
That's what you said!

428
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:43,841
And that's why Sakura and--

429
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,276
-We're all on this squad.

430
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,546
And we're all in it together.

431
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,015
-Yeah, that's right.

432
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,118
We gave our lunch to him
because the three of us are one!

433
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,487
-Uhh, yeah!

434
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,120
Yeah!

435
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:54,754
Yeah!

436
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:55,289
Yeah!

437
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:56,057
Believe it!

438
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,859
That's right!

439
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:01,062
-"The three of you are
one," that's your excuse?

440
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:07,871
Hm.

441
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:09,073
You pass.

442
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,074
-Huh?

443
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:10,674
-Haah?

444
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,549
-You pass.

445
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,517
-What do you mean?

446
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,553
How did we pass?

447
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,056
-You're the first squad
that ever succeeded.

448
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:26,429
The others did exactly what I
said and fell into every trap.

449
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,797
They couldn't think
for themselves.

450
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,935
"A ninja must see
through deception."

451
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:35,406
In the ninja world, those
who break the rules are scum.

452
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,942
That's true.

453
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:44,250
But those who abandon their
friends are worse than scum.

454
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,619
-Ah.

455
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:47,555
-[whimpers]

456
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,523
-Hm.

457
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:54,696
-He's a-- you know,
he's kind of cool.

458
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:57,000
-The exercise is over.

459
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,569
Everyone passes.

460
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,906
Squad 7 starts its
first mission tomorrow!

461
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:02,688
-Yes!

462
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,379
-I did it!

463
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:07,280
I did it!

464
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:08,014
Believe it!

465
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:08,848
I'm a ninja!

466
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:09,315
Ninja!

467
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:10,650
Ninja!

468
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,251
-Let's go home.

469
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:17,693
-Cha!

470
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,194
I did it!

471
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,563
-Aah! [grunts]

472
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,165
I knew they'd do this.

473
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,166
It happens every time.

474
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,536
Believe it!

475
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,538
[grunts]

476
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:29,708
You guys forgot to untie me!

477
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,666
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

478
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:53,237
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

479
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,642
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

480
00:21:56,675 --> 00:22:00,146
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

481
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:06,720
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

482
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:09,991
Sneaking out of the
classroom by the backdoor.

483
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:13,828
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

484
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:17,534
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

485
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,804
Don't try to live so wise.

486
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:23,808
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

487
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:28,381
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

488
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,984
will hate yourself in the end.

489
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:43,733
Don't try to live so wise.

490
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:47,105
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

491
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:51,075
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

492
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:54,046
will hate yourself in the end.

493
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,618
Don't try to live so wise.

494
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:01,222
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

495
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,056
Don't try--

496
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:07,363
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What's up with this?

497
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:10,099
All we're doing are these
boring training missions.

498
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,502
Then finally, we get a
chance at something big,

499
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,940
and it turns out it's just
guarding this old man.

500
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:18,310
And he says, I'm only a
kid, and calls me a loser.

501
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,212
I won't tell you what
I called him back.

502
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:23,049
But I did tell him, look,
someday I'll be-- hey,

503
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,685
are you listening to me?

504
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,979
Next time, "A
Dangerous Mission--

505
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:28,812
Journey to the Land of Waves."

506
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:32,028
Don't miss me as
a full-on ninja!
