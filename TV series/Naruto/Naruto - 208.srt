515
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:18,899
Sorry.

516
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:20,067
But I still think
there's nothing

517
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,835
more valuable than a human life.

two suggest I do now?

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,842
-Well, uh--

527
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,043
-I don't know.

528
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:05,746
It's a shame about
your national treasure.

529

-What are you gonna do?

530
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,515
Sit around and cry about it?

00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,117
I didn't think you
ninja were supposed

532
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,618
to give up that easily.

533
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,954
-The priceless treasure
was lost forever.

534
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,455
There's no changing that.

535
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,591
-So I'll just have
to make another one.

536
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:18,225
-Huh?

537
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,693
-What are you talking about?

just make another one?

-Appearing this week famed
Potter and living national

00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,209
treasure Shin'emon, creator
of The Beauty of Nature.

-Ehh

-Woah.

547
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,844
Wait a minute.

-Huh?

549
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:41,014
-So the national
treasure was you?

550
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:43,150
You're the one who
made that thing?

551
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:47,020
-But I thought you were,
you know, just a client.

552
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:48,655
-What's wrong?

553
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,691
You never been hired by living
national treasure before?

554
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,192
You got a problem with that?

555
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:55,095
-No, but it's just kinda--

556
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,898
-Come on, where's that
indomitable ninja spirit?

557
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,766
Cheer up you guys.

558
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,501
You got me here safe and sound.

559
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:03,470
And as we've all come
to learn, my life

560
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,839
is the greatest treasure of all.

561
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,975
So give yourselves a
big pat on the back.

562
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,643
You did a good job.

563
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,745
For Genin, that is.

564
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,013
Later.

565
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,615
I'm off to make another
priceless irreplaceable

566
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,449
masterpiece.

LADY TSUNADE: Your mission is to
help escort a captured renegade

00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:06,550
to the capital.

572

NARUTO: What do
you mean, renegade?

573
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,686
LADY TSUNADE: He's from a
gang of rogue Shinobi who

574
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,454
no longer owe allegiance
to any master.

575
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:14,124
MAN: They have betrayed
their own ninja way.

The worst of the worst.

LADY TSUNADE: You all
understand the assignment?

578

WOMAN: You said a gang.

579
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:20,130
So chances are, his comrades
will try and free him.

580
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:21,164
LADY TSUNADE: Exactly.

581
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,332
And that's why I'm sending you.

582
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,167
To make sure they don't succeed.

583
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,669
GROUP: Right.
