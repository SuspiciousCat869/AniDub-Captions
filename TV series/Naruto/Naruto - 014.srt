MAN (VOICEOVER): The Village
Hidden in the Leaves--

5
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:47,967
many of the world's
greatest ninja

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,102
have come from this
secret village.

7
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:50,937
-(ANGRILY) Naruto!

8
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,838
Come back here!

9
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,973
When I get my hands on you!

10
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,541
MAN (VOICEOVER):
Naruto Uzumaki--

11
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,977
he's the number one
prankster of the village.

12
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,082
He's also determined to become
the greatest ninja of all.

13
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:04,987
-Give it up, losers!

14
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,655
Transform!

15
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,658
MAN (VOICEOVER):
The sexy jutsu is

16
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:10,893
one of the unusual
techniques he developed.

17
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,329
-(ANGRILY) Cut
the stupid tricks!

18
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:15,832
This is your last warning!

19
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,834
MAN (VOICEOVER): But
Naruto had a secret inside

20
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,436
that even he didn't know about.

21
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,841
12 years ago, a nine-tailed fox
nearly destroyed our village.

22
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,544
To save us, the
spirit of the beast

23
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:28,814
was sealed in the
body of a child.

24
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,117
That child was Naruto.

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,419
The adults of the
village shunned him

26
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,990
because they knew he had the
beast spirit inside of him.

27
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:37,557
-You see him?

28
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,792
It's that boy.

29
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,294
-I heard he's the
only one who failed.

30
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,261
-Hmph.

31
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,697
Well, it serves him right.

32
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,102
-Just imagine what would
happen if he became a ninja.

33
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:47,903
MAN: Ok.

34
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,640
You can open your eyes now.

35
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,442
Congratulations!

36
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,412
You graduate.

37
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,013
MAN (VOICEOVER):
With my approval,

38
00:02:57,046 --> 00:03:01,151
Naruto finally graduated from
the Academy and became a ninja.

39
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,120
[laughing]

40
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:06,357
MAN: Say cheese!

41
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,794
MAN (VOICEOVER): At last he was
ready for his first mission.

42
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,368
Ninja missions are carried
out in squads of three.

43
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:19,640
Naruto's group includes Sasuke
Uchiha of the legendary Uchiha

44
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,774
clan.

45
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,843
Sasuke's superior
skill constantly

46
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:27,148
frustrates Naruto to no end.

47
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:30,718
The other member of the
trio is Sakura Haruno,

48
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,455
a Kunoichi-- a female ninja.

49
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:37,994
Naruto likes Sakura, but she
has a big crush on Sasuke.

50
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:41,865
To succeed, they'll have
to learn to work as a team.

51
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:44,234
Their sensei is Kakashi Hatake.

52
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:47,738
Known as the Copy Ninja, he's
one of the most exceptionally

53
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:52,711
skilled Jonin in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

54
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,913
The group's first
major mission was

55
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:57,416
to guard Tazuna,
the master bridge

56
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:00,853
builder from the Land of Waves.

57
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:02,789
-(YELLING) Yeah!

58
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:03,991
All right!

59
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,193
MAN (VOICEOVER):
However, an evil tycoon

60
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,497
named Gato sought the
bridge builder's life

61
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,167
and control of his country.

62
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,504
MAN: Stop whining.

63
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:17,106
[groaning]

64
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,775
MAN (VOICEOVER): Gato hired an
assassin to eliminate Tazuna.

65
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:22,412
ZABUZA: This time,
I'll go personally.

66
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,682
And this sword will be the
last thing he ever sees.

67
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:28,785
MAN (VOICEOVER): Zabuza
Momochi, a rogue ninja

68
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,055
known as the Demon
of the Hidden Mist.

69
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:34,926
A master of the silent killing
technique, he had many victims.

70
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,330
No one had ever
escaped his soul.

71
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,933
[groaning]

72
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:46,973
MAN (VOICEOVER):
Naruto and his group

73
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:49,243
struggled against Zabuza's
punishing attacks.

74
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:56,384
-(WEAKLY) Hey you, the
freak with no eyebrows--

75
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,988
put this in your bingo book--
the ninja that will become

76
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,758
Hokage of the Village
Hidden in the Leaves--

77
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,895
he never backs down.

78
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:09,566
His name's Naruto Uzumaki.

79
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,703
[yelling]

80
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:13,904
-Not smart enough.

81
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:22,948
A second shuriken in
the shadow of the first.

82
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:26,085
MAN (VOICEOVER): By disguising
himself as a skuriken,

83
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,289
Naruto turned the tables
on the Demon Assassin.

84
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:38,165
Kakashi used the Sharingan
eye to copy Zabuza's jutsu

85
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,538
and reflect those techniques
back at his opponent.

86
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:44,940
[groaning]

87
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,509
-What is that?

88
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,111
It's me.

89
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:48,911
But how?

90
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:52,281
Is it his illusion jutsu?

91
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:55,852
-Water style--
giant vortex jutsu!

92
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,421
-Impossible!

00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:00,024

[gasping]

101
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:32,595
MAN (VOICEOVER): But
the one who dealt

102
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:35,731
the final blow was a tracker
ninja from the Village

103
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:37,233
Hidden in the Mist.

104
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,570
-There are many
secrets in this body.

105
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:42,239
They must not be allowed to
get into the wrong hands.

106
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,978
Please excuse me.

107
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:47,579
Farewell.

108
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,289
MAN (VOICEOVER):
However, this boy, Haku,

109
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,958
was actually Zabuza's partner.

110
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:02,262
-Will you be all
right next time?

111
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:06,334
ZABUZA: Next time, I'll see
right through his [inaudible].

112
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,775
MAN (VOICEOVER): Realizing that
Zabuza must still be alive--

113
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,044
-I got it!

114
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:16,412
MAN (VOICEOVER): Kakashi
prepared his squad

115
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:18,381
to face their enemy
by teaching them

116
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:21,351
special techniques
to control chakra.

117

[grunting]

119
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,794
MAN (VOICEOVER): One week
later, Kakashi's suspicions

120
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:30,829
were confirmed.

121
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:32,964
-His mist.

122
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,067
Sasuke, Sakura, get ready.

123
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,942
-Looks like you've
got a rival, Haku.

124
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:42,575
-So it seems.

125
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,717
MAN (VOICEOVER):
The time has come.

-Secret jutsu.

128
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:05,469
Now, we'll begin, and I'll show
you what speed really means.

129
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,470
-Take this!

Yeah, believe it.

-Ha!

139
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:07,006
Now that I'm here,
everything will be all right.

140
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,541
-Huh?

141
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:09,609
-Naruto!

142
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:11,278
-You know how in
stories, the hero usually

143
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,780
shows up at the last
minute and then kicks butt?

144
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:16,817
Well, that's what I'm
going to do right now!

145
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:17,652
Believe it!

146
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:18,186
-(VOICEOVER) Ugh.

147
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:19,820
This brat again.

What an idiot.

152
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:27,329
If he'd have stayed
hidden, he could

153
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,365
have been so much
more effective.

-Impressive.

Are you training for
something dangerous?

skills so I can get stronger.

-All right!

-Huh?

167
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:03,905
-Naruto!

168
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,107
Move!

169
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,578
[groaning]

[gasping]

171
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,084
-Oh.

172
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,953
-They didn't get him.

173
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,923
-Their weapons cancelled
each other out.

174
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:20,157
Amazing.

175
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,493
Now, that's what I
call lucky, I think.

176
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:23,828
-What are you doing, Naruto?

177
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,030
Are you crazy?

178
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:26,364
-This is a battle,
not a talent show!

179
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:28,900
Don't let your opponent
see your jutsu.

180
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,168
-Uhh.

181
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,071
KAKASHI: The Shinobi's
art is deception.

182
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:34,941
Always keep the enemy guessing.

183
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,809
Even when executing
a single jutsu,

184
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:39,212
one must distract their
opponent's attention--

185
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:42,082
catch them off balance
and outmaneuver them.

186
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,518
You just turned yourself
into a human target

187
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:47,188
when you enter a
battle like that.

188

-(SCREAMING) I'm sorry!

190
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,727
I was just trying
to rescue everybody!

191
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:55,765
-But there's another
mystery here.

192
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,940
-(VOICEOVER) Him.

193
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:07,579
-Haku, what are you doing?

194
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:13,485
-Zabuza, this boy-- let
me fight him my own way.

195
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:14,620
Please.

196
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,388
-Bring it on!

197
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,400
[music playing]

198
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,559
-Hm.

199
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,794
So you want me to
leave this to you.

200
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:52,697
Is that it, Haku?

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,037
As usual, you're too soft.

202
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:03,843
-Forgive me.

203
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:05,645
-(VOICEOVER) Soft?

204
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:08,114
He's right.

205
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,450
Look at these wounds.

206
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:13,020
He cut me up with
his needles, yet he

207
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:15,657
didn't hit a single vital spot.

208
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,419
Why?

209
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,831
Is he just trying
to humiliate me?

210
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:24,000
-I'm warning you!

211
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,437
One way or another, I'm
going to rip off that mask

212
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:30,207
and take you apart!

213
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,342
-(VOICEOVER) It's impossible.

214
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,745
Naruto can't match this kid.

215
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,681
I've got to--

216
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,051
-Don't even think about it.

217
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,953
You know the score, Kakashi.

218
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:46,158
If you go after Haku, I go
after the bridge builder.

219
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,126
[grunting]

220
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,961
-(VOICEOVER) He's got me.

221
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:53,166
I can't protect Tazuna
and help Naruto and Sasuke

222
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,403
at the same time.

223
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:59,140
Sakura's feisty, but she
can't fight Zabuza alone.

224
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:00,942
-Relax, Kakashi.

225
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,445
Sit back and enjoy the show.

226
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:08,083
Let's see how they
do-- one on one.

227
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:10,686
-That mask and your bogus story!

228
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,123
You were with Zabuza all along!

229
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:17,328
You think you can get away
with a stunt like that?

230
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,595
-I'm sorry.

231
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,797
-Huh?

232
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:23,068
-But as your sensei said,
deceiving your opponent,

233
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:27,506
catching them off guard-- that
is the art of the Shinobi.

234
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,974
Please don't take it personally.

235
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,012
-(VOICEOVER) And while
you're jabbering,

236
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,848
I'll catch you off guard!

237
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,856
[gasping]

238
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,258
-Sasuke?

239
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,426
-I haven't forgotten about you.

240
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,096
Not for an instant.

241
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,703
-(VOICEOVER) So that's where
Sasuke is-- he's pinned down.

242
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:56,539
-Some warriors accept
defeat gracefully.

243
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,441
They know when they are beaten.

244
00:13:58,475 --> 00:14:00,010
Others do not.

245
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:01,379
So be it.

246
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:05,083
Let us finish our battle
then-- to the death!

247
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,885
-Wha-- hey!

248
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:07,952
Where are you going?

249
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,688
-It's all right, Naruto.

250
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,157
We'll have our fight next.

251

00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,498
-(VOICEOVER) What is he?

254
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:19,966
-(VOICEOVER) Here he comes.

255
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:30,746
The real one is over there.

256
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:31,446
Now--

257
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,681
HAKU: I'm behind you.

258
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:39,789
-(VOICEOVER) He transported
himself in an instant.

259
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:40,570
How?

260
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,471
[gasping]

261
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:57,043
[groaning]

262
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,044
-Sasuke!

263
00:14:58,077 --> 00:14:59,812
-Sasuke!

264
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,215
(VOICEOVER) What is that?

265
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,386
Sasuke's getting all
ripped up, and I can't even

266
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,355
tell where the attacks
are coming from.

267
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,557
How's he doing that?

268
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,597
[groaning]

269
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,168
-(VOICEOVER) What
kind of jutsu is this?

270
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:23,539
Could it be he has clones
hiding in the mirrors

271
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,709
all throwing needles
at the same time?

272
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,213
No.

273
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,516
They're too fast for that.

274
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:34,419
I can't even see where
they're coming from!

275
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,755
And if it was just
a clone jutsu,

276
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,693
then he wouldn't
need the ice mirrors.

277
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:43,697
Those mirrors are definitely
the key to his attacks,

278
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,300
but what's my next move?

279
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,342
-Sasuke, Naruto, think!

280
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,077
You need to attack
from the outside

281
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:58,914
and from the inside
at the same time!

282
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:01,984
-(VOICEOVER) To figure
out how the mirrors work!

283
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,086
-I've got it!

284
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,157
-(VOICEOVER) Yes, it's
all about positioning,

285
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,061
and Naruto and I are in
the perfect position.

286
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:14,198
If I attack him from
here, and Naruto hits him

287
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:17,335
from the outside, we can do it.

288
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,337
-Hey!

289
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,306
I snuck in here to save you!

290
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,442
Pretty cool move, huh, Sasuke?

291
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,578
[groaning]

292
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:30,383
-Naruto, you sneak up on
your enemy, not your ally.

293
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,118
-(ANGRILY) You are
a complete loser!

294
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:32,953
You're a Shinobi.

295
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:34,221
Think carefully before you more.

296
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,290
-(ANGRILY) What the
heck's your problem!

297
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,593
You should thank me for
coming in here to help you!

298
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:41,196
-Naruto, if we're both
inside here-- ugh!

299
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,297
Forget it!

300
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,666
I've had it with your mistakes!

301
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,169
-(ANGRILY) And I've had
it with your attitude!

302
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,570
Believe it!

303

a solid reputation as the most

304
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,608
clueless ninja in history.

305
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:55,179
The more he helps,
the worst things get.

306
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,280
-That's it.

307
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,949
I'm going to destroy
these mirrors right now.

308
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,418
Fire style.

309
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,386
-Hey!

310
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,420
What attack are you using?

311
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:03,388
-These mirrors are made of ice.

312
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:04,623
So how do you destroy ice?

313
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,894
Figure it out. (YELLING)
Fire ball jutsu!

-(YELLING) That didn't
do anything at all!

00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,681
-You'll need much more heat
than that to melt this ice.

-Where is he?

Where's the needle
attack coming at us from?

322
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:47,239
Are they clones?

[groaning]

324
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,175
We've got to find the real one!

325
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,277
Which one is it?

326
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,080
-Look into every mirror
as hard as you like.

327
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:57,150
You will never learn the secret.

00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,520
-No, don't!

331
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:02,122
[yelling]

332
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:06,094
-You've got 100 mirrors, then
100 of me will smash them all.

333
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,632
Then I'll find where
you really are!

334
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,601
[grunting]

335
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,204
[screaming]

336
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,548
[screaming]

337
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:31,423
-These mirrors only
reflect my image,

338
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:35,127
allowing me to transport
myself at light speed.

339
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,100
Through my eyes, you appear
to be moving in slow motion.

340
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:40,734
[groaning]

341
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,068
-I knew it.

342
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:45,306
It's a bloodline
trait-- Kekkei Genkai.

343
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,541
[laughing]

344
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:48,510
-Kekkei Genkai?

345
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:49,611
What is it?

346
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:51,546
-It's like my Sharingan.

347
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,148
You can't learn it.

348
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:56,885
It has to be in your blood-- in
your genetic code passed down

349
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,891
from generation to generation
within a single clan.

350
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,159
-But that means--

351
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:03,993
-Yes.

352
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:06,263
Even I can't copy that jutsu.

353
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:11,769
There's no way to destroy
it and no way to stop him.

354
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:15,040
[groaning]

355
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:17,042
-I couldn't break through.

356
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,477
-Huh?

357
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,545
-So what?

358
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:21,413
He's not going to stop me.

359
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,815
[gasping]

360
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:25,118
I'm not giving up, and I'm
not going to lose here.

361
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:26,887
Because I have a
dream, and no one's

362
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,789
going to take it away from me.

363
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,391
Some day, I'll be
respected in my village.

364
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:35,530
That's my dream-- to
be the greatest Hokage!

365
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:36,130
-Dreams?

366
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:52,116
[foot steps]

367
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,488
[laughing]

368
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,922
ZABUZA: Pathetic little urchin.

369
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,534
No one wants you, huh?

370
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:12,372
Before winter ends, you'll
die with nothing-- not even

371
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,574
a dream.

372
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,174
Huh?

373
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,080
-Your eyes are just
like mine, mister.

374
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,649
We're both the same.

375
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:28,625
-It was not my desire
to be a Shinobi.

376
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,128
It's painful.

377
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,997
I don't want to kill you.

378
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:39,137
But if you advance, I
will have no choice.

379
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,272
Then I will kill the
kindness in my own heart

380
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:44,910
and fully embrace
the Shinobi way.

381
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,714
And there will be no
mercy-- no turning back.

382
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,683
This bridge will
be the battlefield

383
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,053
where our dreams collide.

384
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:59,093
Now I must fight for my dream
just as you fight for yours.

385
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,396
Please do not blame me.

386
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,166
I fight for someone
who is precious to me.

387
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:07,202
I live for him, and
I face death for him

388
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:11,007
so that his dream
may become reality.

389
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,109
That is my dream.

390
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:15,445
And for the sake of
that dream-- if I must,

391
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:19,283
I will act as a Shinobi
and take your lives.

392
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:40,297

[music playing]

394
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,733
NARUTO: Crystal
ice mirrors-- wait

395
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,468
til you see how I smash them!

396
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:14,506
I finally figured out
how to break through.

397
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,507
[laughing]

398
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,942
All right, Sasuke,
we got to get out

399
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,944
of here so we can
help Kakashi Sensei.

400
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:22,315
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

401
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:23,049
Sensei!

402
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,017
Sakura!

403
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,785
Hold on til we get there!

404
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:29,625
Next time-- "Zero Visibility--
The Sharingan Shatters."

405
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,692
If I don't pull this
off, we're all done for!
