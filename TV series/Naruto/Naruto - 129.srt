35
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:29,055
It's headquarters for
the Leaf Police Force.

36
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:33,022
-I was wondering, how come
the crest of the Uchiha clan

37
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,022
is part of the Leaf
Police Force insignia?

38
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:39,022
-Well, what do you know,
You finally noticed.

39
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,755
-Course I did.

00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:42,188
-Right.

41
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:45,255
Let me see if I can
explain it for you.

42
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:48,522
It was the Uchiha clan's
earliest ancestors

43
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,188
who established the police
here in the village.

44
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:55,355
So, when they created the
symbol for the organization,

45
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:58,222
they used the family crest.

46
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,588
Since a long time
ago, the Uchiha

47
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:03,155
have always ensured
the peace here.

48
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:05,655
The crest is a testament
of our clan's pride

49
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:09,055
and a way of life centuries old.

50
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:12,788
Over the years, the Uchiha
clan has grown smaller.

51
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:16,588
But even now, nearly all of
us are a part of the force

52
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:20,322
and work to uphold the
peace in this village.

53
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,855
Which is good because only the
most exceptional of shinobi

54
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:28,155
can weed out the criminals
hiding among their brethren.

00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:32,755
-Wow, Dad is the coolest.

56
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:35,355
Are you going to
join the force too?

57
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:37,488
-Well, I'm not sure.

58
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:40,288
-Why not?

59
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,055
Oi, when I grow
up, I'm definitely

60
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,988
going to enter the police force.

61
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:46,755
And Father's coming to
tomorrow's entrance ceremony.

It's the first step to my dream.

-You don't have to worry
about me out there.

And more importantly--

tomorrow afternoon is--

it's not just about you.

reflect on our entire clan.

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,117
-I can't tell you.

166
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,117
The mission is covert.

167
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,617
-Hm.

168
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:03,617
Itachi, you also serve as
the Uchiha clan's pipeline

169
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,184
to the Village Nerve Center.

170
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:09,150
You know that, don't you?

171
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:10,817
-Yes.

172
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,150
-Well, make sure
you don't forget it.

173
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,117
You will be at that
meeting tomorrow.

174
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:20,717
-Sasuke--

175
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,650
-Uh, ah.

176
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:26,017
-Use the bathroom
and go to sleep.

177
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,784
-OK.

178
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:30,217
-What are you doing roaming
the house at this hour?

179
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,084
Get to bed.

180
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,850
-Yes, sir.

181
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:37,184
[crickets]

182
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,584
[crow squawk]

183
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:45,350
-Father only cares
about you, Itachi.

184
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:52,450
-You probably hate me, huh?

185
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,450
It's all right.

186
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:57,417
people often think
ill of shinobi.

187
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,284
It's only logical.

188
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,750
-That's not how I feel.

189
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,350
He's right, though.

190
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,950
I do.

191
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:09,750
I do feel that way.

192
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:14,584
-Huh, being the best isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

193
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:17,284
When you have power, you
become arrogant and isolated

194
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:20,417
from the world, no matter
how coveted and sought

195
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,517
after you are in the beginning.

196
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,084
But with us, it's
different because you and I

197
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,017
are flesh and blood.

198
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,584
I'm always going to be
there for you, even if it's

199
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:33,517
only as an obstacle
for you to overcome.

200
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,550
Even if you do hate me, that's
what big brothers are for.

201
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,884
-Is Itachi in there?

202
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,450
We need to talk.

203
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:42,084
Get out here.

204
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,350
-What's going on?

205
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,684
What are you all doing here?

206
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:51,450
-There were two people
who didn't show up

207
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:53,584
at yesterday's assembly.

208
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:57,217
Do you want to tell me
why you weren't there?

209
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,317
-The meeting Father was
talking about last night,

210
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,450
he didn't go after all.

211
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:04,217
-You're in the
ANBU Black Ops now.

212
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,917
I know, full well,
you can be called away

213
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,584
at the drop of a hat.

214
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,117
And that's the case
your father was

215
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,084
trying to make when we
asked why you weren't there.

216
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,484
-But we're not your father.

217
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:17,384
You will be getting any
special treatment from us.

218
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,050
-I understand.

219
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,450
I should have been more careful.

220
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:23,750
Will that be all
then, gentleman?

221
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:25,217
-Sure thing.

222
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,717
But you know what?

223
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,517
Before we go, there's
just one other thing.

224
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,950
-Mhm.

225
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:35,917
-Do you know anything about
Shisui Uchiha ending his life

226
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,717
in Naka no River?

227
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,117
-Ending his life?

228
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,984
-Shisui was the other guy who
never turned up at the assembly

229
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,384
yesterday.

230
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,617
It's funny.

231
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,984
If I remember correctly,
you kind of looked up to him

232
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:50,484
like an older
brother, didn't you?

233
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:51,917
-How terrible.

234
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,250
Forgive me, I haven't
seen him at all recently.

235
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,217
What a tragedy.

236
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:02,150
-Yeah.

237
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:02,750
Well.

238
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:03,717
At this point.

239
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,150
The police force
sees no other choice

240
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,684
but to launch an all-out
investigation into the matter.

241
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:08,317
-Investigation?

242
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,517
-This is a note
Shisui left behind.

243
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,150
We've already had it analyzed.

244
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:19,017
There's no question,
this is his handwriting.

245
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,717
-But if it wasn't homicide,
why the investigation?

246
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,517
-It'd be no great
feat for someone

247
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,784
who possesses Sharingan
to copy his handwriting.

248
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,850
-The most talented
of all our clan,

249
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:36,350
feared as Shisui
the teleporter--

250
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:38,317
he was a man who
would do anything,

251
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,784
take any mission, if it was
for the good of the clan.

252
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,917
-Hard to imagine a man
like that ending his life,

253
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,750
don't you think?

254
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:49,417
-You shouldn't judge
people by their appearance

255
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,784
or by your own preconceptions.

256
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,117
-We'll leave that with
you for the time being.

257
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,917
Take it to ANBU Black Ops
and put in a request for them

258
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,017
to start sniffing
around on this, as well.

259
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,550
-Understood.

260
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,984
-Let's just hope we get
a lead on this soon.

261
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:10,117
By the way, we have our
own connections inside

262
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,950
of ANBU Black Ops.

263
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:14,517
You try and sweep this
investigation under the rug,

264
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,884
and we're going
to know about it.

265
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,350
-Why don't you just
come out and say it?

266
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,450
You believe I had a
hand in this, don't you?

267
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:30,250
-Yeah, that's
right, little punk.

268
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,784
-Listen, Itachi.

269
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,617
If I find you
betrayed this clan,

270
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,550
I want you to know you'll
pay for your wrongs.

271
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:41,984
[punches]

272
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:45,950
[groans]

273
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:50,384
-Like I said before,
appearances and preconceptions

274
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,850
aren't going to
tell you anything.

275
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:54,850
For instance, you've
made the mistake

276
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,417
of assuming I'm a patient man.

277
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,584
The clan, the clan-- you
overestimate your own abilities

278
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:06,284
with no idea of the
depth of my own.

279
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,617
And look at you now,
groveling in the dirt.

280
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,184
-I've never seen him
like this before.

281
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:18,450
-Shisui, Shisui, I've been
keeping an eye on you recently.

282
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:21,484
The strangeness of your
behavior-- half a year

283
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:25,484
into your time at ANBU, it
was impossible to overlook.

284
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:29,017
What the heck are you playing
at, you filthy little wretch?

285
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,317
-Obsessed with the organization,
obsessed with the clan,

286
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,117
obsessed with our lineage--
a worthless compulsion

287
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,784
that enslaves us and
limits our capabilities,

288
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:45,517
leading us to fear what
you don't understand.

289
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,984
-Stop it, Itachi.

290
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:50,284
What on earth is
the matter with you?

291
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:53,084
Itachi, you've been
strange lately.

292
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,250
-Nothing strange about me.

293
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:02,084
I have my own duties
to fulfill, that's all.

294
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:03,217
-So what's your story?

295
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,784
Why didn't you come last night?

296
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,384
-To achieve the next state.

297
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,884
-What are you talking about?

298
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:12,384
-Oh.

299
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,950
-I've had enough.

300
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:27,384
There's no hope left
for this pathetic clan.

301
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:30,417
Since a very long
time ago, the Uchiha

302
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,417
have always ensured
the peace here.

303
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,817
The crest is a testament
of our clan's pride

304
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,284
and a way of life centuries old.

305
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:43,284
-That's my boy, you'll go far
in the ANBU ranks, no question

306
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:44,917
about it.

307
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,984
-The people of this
clan are all the same.

308
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:49,917
You focus on the
trivial and lose sight

309
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,117
of what's most important.

310
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,917
Change is impossible in
this fog of ignorance.

311
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,050
How can we evolve when
regulation is all we know?

312
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,650
-Such arrogance.

313
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:01,917
That's enough.

314
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,450
If I hear one more
word of this nonsense,

315
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:07,550
I'll have you
thrown behind bars.

316
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:11,750
-Hm, being the best isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

317
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,650
When you have power, you
become arrogant and isolated

318
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:17,784
from the world, no matter
how coveted and sought

319
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,284
after you are in the beginning.

320
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:23,150
-Brother, why?

321
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:26,250
-Well, what's it gonna be?

322
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:28,217
I cant take this anymore.

323
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,484
Please sir, just
give me the order.

324
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:33,084
-Big Brother, you have to stop.

325
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:33,550
-Huh?

326
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,517
-I'm not the one
who killed Shisui,

327
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,684
but I apologize for the
words I have spoken.

328
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:49,650
I am truly sorry.

329
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:58,217
-Hm, he's been pretty tired
lately, up to his ears

330
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,984
in missions from
the ANBU Black Ops.

331
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,284
-But, Captain--

332
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:06,017
-ANBU are under the direct
control of the Hokage.

333
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,984
Even if you wanted to
arrest one of them,

334
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,517
we would need to
get a warrant first.

335
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:17,617
As for Itachi, I take full
responsibility for him.

336
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,617
You've my word.

337
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,517
[sigh]

338
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,484
-Very well, sir.

339
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:58,317
-I hope that woke you up.

340
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,784
Now you know I'm
not messing around.

341
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,284
-Ha.

342
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:08,284
-We had a bit of an
interruption that day.

343
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,750
But that won't happen this time.

344
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,750
-Ah.

345
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:17,717
-Let me show you the true
power of the Sharingan.

346
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:35,151

347
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:04,073
-What's wrong, Naruto?

348
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:06,073
What are you holding back for?

349
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,873
Or is this the full
extent of your power?

350
00:23:09,907 --> 00:23:14,640
So you went on and on about
you Nindo, your ninja way.

351
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:17,673
And this is the best
you can do, huh?

352
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:18,307
Ha.

353
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,507
Give me a break.

354
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,207
In this state, you're
not even worth defeating.

355
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,273
NARRATOR: Next time, Father
and Son, the Broken Crest.
