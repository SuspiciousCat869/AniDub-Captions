2
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,876
-You're an embarrassment
to our village.

3
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,446
Had you forgotten the reason
we came all the way here?

4
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,480
-I know.

5
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,316
I, I mean, they challenged us.

6
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,750
They started the
whole thing, really.

7
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,119
-See here's what happened.

8
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,353
-Shut up.

00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,622
-[groan]

00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,090
-Or I'll kill you.

11
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,858
-Ah, right.

12
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,392
I was totally out of line.

13
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,161
I'm-- I'm sorry, Gaara.

14
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,563
I was totally out of line.

15
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:14,266
I'm sorry for any
trouble he caused.

16
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:17,703
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): This guy
has an evil look in his eye.

17
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,639
GAARA (VOICEOVER): He stopped
Kankuro with a pebble.

18
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,507
Made it look easy.

19
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,909
This guy is someone
to keep an eye on.

20
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,750
Let's go.

21
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,452
We didn't come
here to play games.

22
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:35,519
-All right, sure.

23
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:36,520
I get it.

24
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:37,788
-Hold on!

25
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,056
Hey!

26
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,123
-What?

27
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:42,059
-I can tell from your
headband that you

28
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:45,863
come from the village
hidden in the sand.

29
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:49,031
Of course the land the fire and
the land of wind are allies.

30
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,568
But no Shinobi can
enter another's village

31
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,436
without permission.

32
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,637
So state your purpose.

33
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,438
And it better be good.

34
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,874
-Really.

35
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:59,976
Have you guys all been
living under a rock or what?

36
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,678
You don't know what's
going on, do you?

37
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,313
We have permission.

38
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:05,747
-[gasp]

39
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,248
-Of course, you're correct.

40
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,784
We are hidden Sand Genin.

41
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,919
Our home is the
land of the wind.

42
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:13,188
And we're here for
the Chunin exams.

43
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:14,822
Get the picture?

44
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:16,224
-The Chunin exams?

45
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:18,793
What's that?

46
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:23,363
Identify yourself,
powerful new rivals!

47
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:27,167
Well, I've never heard of
any Chunin exams, believe it.

48
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,437
-I believe it, all right,
that you're totally clueless.

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,671
-Hey, boss!

50
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,206
Those are the exams
that every Genin's

51
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,342
got to take in order to graduate
to being a full-on Chunin.

52
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,311
-Oh, well why didn't you say so?

53
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,612
I am so there!

54
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,146
-Huh.

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,815
Hey, you.

56
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,983
Identify yourself.

57
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:45,684
-Hm?

58
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,152
You mean me?

59
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,086
-No, him.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,388
The guy with the
gord on his back.

61
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,989
-Huh?

62
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:55,427
My name is Gaara of the desert.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,129
I'm curious about you, too.

64
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,664
Who are you?

65
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,865
-I am Sasuke Uchiha.

66
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:09,873
-Hi there!

67
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,742
I bet you're dying to
know my name, right?

68
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:12,943
-I couldn't care less.

69
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:17,880
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Hm.

70
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:20,816
Things are getting interesting.

71
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,951
-Hey, Konohamaru.

72
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:24,419
Do I seem uncool or something?

73
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,255
-Well, compared to Sasuke, yeah.

74
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,122
You're pretty lame.

75
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:28,190
NARUTO: Nah!

76
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:30,259
You're not going to
show me up, Sasuke!

77
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:30,825
SASUKE: Hm.

78
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,861
Back off, loser.

79
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,162
-What do you think, Dosu?

80
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:37,331
-The usual weaklings--
nothing special.

81
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,768
But the one from the
Uchiha clan and that desert

82
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:44,037
rat-- we should
watch them carefully.

83
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:48,208
-All right, it is time we chose
our candidates for the Chunin

84
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,409
examinations.

85
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,379
To begin, will those in
charge of the rookie Genin

86
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:55,015
step forward?

87
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:58,818
Kakashi, Kurenai, and Asuma.

88
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,553
What do you say?

89
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,088
Are there any in
your squads you'd

90
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,623
recommend who are
ready for the exams

91
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:06,725
despite their inexperience?

92
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,128
As you know, any
Genin who has carried

93
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,530
out eight or more
missions is technically

94
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,465
eligible for the examinations.

95
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:17,068
Beyond that, only you can
decide when they are ready.

96
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:21,039
Of course, most Genin require
a much longer training period--

97
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,341
at least twice
that many missions.

98
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,643
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): There's
no need to say all this.

99
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,878
It's way too soon
for their squads.

100
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,079
-So, Kakashi.

101
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,647
You begin.

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,751
-I lead squad seven--
Sasuke Uchiha,

103
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:38,622
Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno.

104
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:41,758
I, Kakashi Hatake,
recommend all three

105
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,361
of these Genin for the
Chunin selection exams.

106
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:46,895
[gasp]

107
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,097
-And my squad is number eight.

108
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:55,070
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,
Shino Aburame, and now I,

109
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:58,740
Kurenai Yuhi,
recommend all three.

110
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,908
-And my squad is number 10.

111
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:06,080
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru
Nara, Choji Akimichi.

112
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:10,517
And now I, Asuma Sarutobi,
recommend all three.

113
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,252
RABBLE: Rookies?

114
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,019
[chatter]

115
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:14,988
-It's been five years since--

116
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,591
-It doesn't make any sense.

117
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,125
-Hold on, just a minute.

118
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:19,760
-Yes.

119
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:21,227
What is it, Iruka?

120
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,495
-Lord Hokage.

121
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:25,198
With all respect, the nine
names that were just given

122
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:28,100
were all my students
at the Academy.

123
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,803
I know their skills
and abilities.

124
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,638
Every one of them
has great promise.

125
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,039
But it's too soon.

126
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,508
They need more experience
before they are tested.

127
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,478
If they try now, they're
sure to fail the exam.

128
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:43,314
When I became a Chunin, I was
six years younger than Naruto

129
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:44,415
is now.

130
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,885
-Naruto is nothing like you!

131
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,853
Are you trying to destroy him?

132
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,788
-Well, they're
always complaining

133
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,056
about not being
challenged enough.

134
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,560
Maybe wiping out on the exams
will teach them a lesson.

135
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:58,461
A little pain is good?

136
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,864
-What-- what did you say?

137
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,865
-Oh, nothing fatal, of course.

138
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,567
But seriously, Iruka.

139
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:05,602
Relax.

140
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,536
-[groan]

141
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,504
-Listen.

142
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:08,838
I understand how you feel.

143
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,307
It's very personal for
you and it upsets you.

144
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,974
But--

145
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:13,175
-All right, Kakashi.

146
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:13,843
Back off.

147
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,311
You've said enough.

148
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:17,579
-On the contrary, Kurenai,
Iruka needs to hear this.

149
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:21,450
He needs to realize that they're
not his students anymore.

150
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,283
They're mine.

151
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,686
-[growl]

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,089
-[groan] Enough already.

153
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,892
-[sigh]

154
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:34,261
-But these exams
could destroy them!

155
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:35,229
You know that.

156
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:36,964
-Iruka!

157
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,698
You have made your point.

158
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,634
I understand.

159
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,269
-Lord Hokage.

160
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,705
-Accordingly, I have decided
that the best thing to do

161
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:48,608
is to hold a special
preliminary test.

162
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,609
-Pre-- preliminary test?

163
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:00,853
-[sigh] [scream]

164
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:02,387
Why, why, why?

165
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,722
It's always the same!

166
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:05,858
He sets the time and then we
have to wait hours for him.

167
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:07,659
-It's not fair!

168
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,026
-What about my feelings?

169
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,962
I rushed here so
fast, I didn't even

170
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,430
have time to blow-dry my hair!

171
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:14,932
-And I didn't even have
enough time to brush my teeth

172
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,633
or change my underwear!

173
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,769
-You didn't?

174
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,337
That's really
disgusting, Naruto.

175
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:22,273
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): First
thing in the morning

176
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:24,408
and they're already
driving me nuts.

177
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:28,745
-Hey.

178
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,313
Good morning, everyone.

179
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:31,347
Sorry I'm late.

180
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,549
Afraid I got lots
on the path of life.

181
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,619
-You liar!

182
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:39,221
-I know this is a bit
sudden, but I recommended you

183
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,191
for the Chuning exams--
all three of you.

184
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,693
These are the application forms.

185
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,695
-Application forms?

186
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,530
-You're repeating me, Sakura.

187
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:49,898
This is all voluntary.

188
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,232
It's up to each of you.

189
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,501
If you don't feel ready,
you can wait until next

190
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,803
-All right!

191
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,971
Kakashi Sensai, you rock!

192
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,706
-Don't slobber on my vest!

193
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,909
Whoever wants to take the
exams, sign the application

194
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,311
and come to room
301 at the Academy.

195
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,514
It's at 3:00 PM
five days from now.

196
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,415
That's it.

197
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,616
-[laughter]

198
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,750
Chunin exams.

199
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,019
Chunin exams!

200
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:17,990
Hm.

201
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,325
Chunin exams.

202
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,229
I'll be up against a lot
of really wicked ninja!

203
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,366
Like the guy with the
mummy on his back!

204
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,100
And, of course, Mr. Attitude.

205
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,740
All right!

206
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,142
Who's the grand champion?

207
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,777
That would be me!

208
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,214
If I come out on top, becoming
Hokage will be easy after that.

209
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,016
-I have to accept it.

210
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,152
Naruto is better than
an old geezer like me.

211
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,887
So I'll just retire
and let him be Hokage.

212
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,389
-Yay!

213
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:55,258
[giggling]

214
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,127
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I hope I get
the chance to fight that guy.

215
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,936
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
This is hopeless.

216
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,872
I can't keep up with Sasuke.

217
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:11,940
I can't even beat Naruto!

218
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:14,209
I'll never pass these exams.

219
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,232
-Hey, Naruto!

220
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,601
Come and play ninja
with us, please!

221
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,002
-Sure!

222
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,538
I don't have any dangerous ninja
missions today, so no problem.

223
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,071
-Excellent!

224
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,608
-All right!

225
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:49,074
-[gasp]

226
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,943
-Huh.

227
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:51,643
-[laughter]

228
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:52,277
-[scream]

229
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,512
-[gasp]

230
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,879
-[scream]

231
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:55,847
Naruto!

232
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,815
Konohamaru!

233
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,116
Help!

234
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:00,151
-What are you doing with
Moegi, you big slug?

235
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,319
-Let her go!

236
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,320
Now!

237
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:03,687
-Ha ha!

238
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:05,056
[growl]

239
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,657
-Come on, Konohamaru!

240
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,658
[grunt]

241
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:08,659
-I'm with you, boss!

242
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:09,260
-Hold on!

243
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,973
-[sigh]

244
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:25,675
Chunin exams.

245
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,643
-Hey.

246
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:27,610
-[gasp]

247
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:28,778
-Sasuke!

248
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,179
What's up?

249
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:32,714
-Let's take a walk, just and me.

250
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:34,015
-No way!

251
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,150
You mean it?

252
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:38,954
-[laughter] Well, well.

253
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,889
He can keep up with
me at this speed.

254
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:42,490
-I'll get this creep!

255
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,005
Moegi!

256
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:47,791
-Oh, man.

257
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:48,625
This is bad.

258
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:49,426
Where's the boss?

259
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,594
We've got to find the boss!

260
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,063
-Are we lost, or is he?

261
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:53,830
MOEGI: No!

262
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:55,031
You let me go!

263
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,532
-[laughter]

264
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,768
I thought that Hidden Leaf
Village had powerful ninja.

265
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,805
But now I see you're nothing--
just a bunch of weaklings.

266
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,940
Hm?

267
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,575
Well, that's was quick.

268
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:07,609
-Hey, you!

269
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:08,510
Yeah, you!

270
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,578
The fat old guy!

271
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,613
What do you think
you're doing with Moegi?

272
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:12,681
-What am I doing?

273
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,215
Is that your question?

274
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,117
You really want to know?

275
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,251
-[gasp]

276
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,954
-If you move, the
brat's finished.

277
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:20,889
-Hey!

278
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,590
Why are you doing this?

279
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:23,557
She's just a kid.

280
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:24,625
Let her go!

281
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,627
-I want the first Hokage
scroll of sealing.

282
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,129
Bring it to me and
I'll let the girl go.

283
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:32,866
-The scroll of sealing?

284
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,601
-Um, Sasuke?

285
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:38,538
How come all of a sudden you,
you know, want to walk with me?

286
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:42,341
-Because I need to tell you to
give up on the Chunin exams.

287
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:45,111
There's no way you
can pass them, Sakura.

288
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:47,179
-I was afraid of that.

289
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,647
You're right.

290
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,617
-These ninja are very advanced
and they have no mercy.

291
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,120
If you try to fight them,
you could lose your life.

292
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,588
-But Sasuke!

293
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:59,290
you're telling me this
gives you care about me!

294
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,726
-I, uh, guess that's true.

295
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,760
-Ha ha!

296
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:03,961
Two sweethearts.

297
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:05,095
How touching.

298
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,164
-Get lost, unless
you want to die.

299
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,365
-Talk is cheap!

300
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:09,166
Ra!

-[grunt]

302
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,937
Now I'm really mad!

303
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,072
-Careful, Sasuke!

304
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,808
-No way!

305
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:19,409
[gasp]

306
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:23,680
-Sasuke!

[gasp]

308
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,827
Sasuke?

309
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,429
Sasuke!

310
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:43,798
Sasuke!

-[mumbling]

312

-Don't just stand
there like a fool!

313
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,636
Hurry up and get the scroll!

314
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,838
-Oh, yeah right.

315
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,539
And what happens if I say no?

316
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:55,709
-Then I guess you don't care
what happens to this girl.

317
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:56,943
-What girl?

318
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:59,646
I see is two dummies-- you,
and the one next to you

319
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,113
made of straw.

320
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:00,881
-What?

321
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,515
Where'd she go?

322
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,417
Huh?

323
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,487
-She's right there with the
greatest ninja in the world.

324
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,088
-Yeah, that's you, boss!

325
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,756
You're my hero!

326
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,891
-A clone Jutsu?

327
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:13,192
I'll waste you, punk!

328
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:17,296
-You just don't know
when you're outclassed!

[grunting]

We're here!

332
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,668
-Yeah, well, it's
about time, you guys!

-Konohamaru!

00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:26,838
I was really scared!

335
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:28,840
-OK, it's all right.

336
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:30,208
-Did you catch him, boss?

337
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,043
Can we see him?

338
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:32,810
-Sure!

339
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:33,611
He's right here.

340
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:35,546
I'll show you what he-- huh?

341
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,148
-Hey, he used the
substitution Jutsu on you!

342
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,116
-Copycat!

343
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,984
That's what I did to him!

344
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:41,618
-I see.

345
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,756
-[crying]

346
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,024
-Ha ha ha ha!

347
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,592
He's finished.

348
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:52,795
And that's how you'll end up
if you take the Chunin exams.

349
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:53,695
-Oh, Sasuke!

350
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:56,765
Ha!

351
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,167
I'm no idiot.

352
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,269
I saw right through that cheap
Genjutsu from the first moment.

353
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,571
-What?

354
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:05,573
-Sasuke inviting me out
then suddenly acting

355
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,475
like he's all worried about me?

356
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,444
Yeah, like he'd ever.

357
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:11,479
That was a foolish mistake.

358
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:13,514
You thought I'd fall for that?

359
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:15,149
-Are you calling me a fool?

360
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,884
-I would if you
were really here.

361
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,118
But you're just an illusion.

362
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,754
The real ninja ran
away like a coward.

363
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,855
So you're just the
illusion of a coward.

364
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,158
-[laughter]

365
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,859
Are you show I'm not real?

366
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,032
-Yeah, I'm sure.

367
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,567
-[laughter]

368
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,403
Just what I'd expect from a
kunoichi trained by Kakashi.

369
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,338
But the Chunin exams will
be more than illusions.

370
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,074
We'll see if you can cut it.

371
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,441
-You don't scare me!

372
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,744
Illusions or not, bring them on!

373
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,480
The Chunin exams!

374
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:51,749
Take that, Chunin exam!

375
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,385
Oh, actually, I'm really
worried about them.

376
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:01,292
-[groan]

377
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,893
-Stay out of our village.

378
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,369
-So, how did it go?

379
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:15,838
-They all mad it-- your
squad and the others.

380
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,510
All nine Genin proved
themselves ready for the exam.

381
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:21,711
-You were right, Kakashi.

382
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:22,845
They're good.

383
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,547
They've all developed
very impressive skills.

384
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,648
Hm.

385
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:29,484
But the Chuning exams
can break anyone.

386
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:32,053
We'll see if they
can tough it out.

387
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:34,022
-Did you jear?

388
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,556
We're going to have
rookies at the exams.

389
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,758
First year Ganin.

390
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,193
That has not happened
in five years.

391
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:40,694
-No way.

392
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,997
I bet it's just some Jonin
trying to boost their egos.

393
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,734
-No, there's more to
the story than that.

394
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,803
Three of them are
from Kakashi's squad.

395
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:50,938
-Huh.

396
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,172
Interesting.

397
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,140
-But not very.

398
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:58,010
-Either way, it's
too bad for them.

399
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:02,815
-Sakura!

400
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,051
Hey, you're late.

401
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,318
-Uh, right.

402
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:07,519
Sorry, guys.

403
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:16,327
Good morning, Sasuke.

404
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:18,429
-Yeah.

405
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:20,097
What's up with her?

406
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,199
She's different.

407
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,067
[chatter]

408
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,001
-What's going on?

409
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,002
-Can you see?

410
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,403
-I don't know.

411
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:27,972
-[groan]

412
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,373
-Huh.

413
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,708
You're taking the Chunin exams,
but you can't even get past us?

414
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:34,678
-Why don't you just give
up now before you get hurt?

415
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:38,314
-Yeah, I think I hear
your mommy calling you.

416
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,348
-Please let us through!

417
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,851
We're supposed to go in there.

418
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:43,819
[smack]

419
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:46,088
-[groan]

420
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,357
-That's harsh!

421
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,125
-Did you say harsh?

422
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,193
Don't kid yourself.

423
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:52,761
We're being nice by comparison.

424
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:55,964
The exams are going to make
this look like a picnic.

425
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:58,300
-Some of you won't
survive the exams.

426
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,734
Others will be wrecked for life.

427
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,769
And some of you may go crazy.

428
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:04,505
For Chunin, it's
always life and death.

429
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:06,007
-You think it's a joke?

430
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,509
Chunin are qualified
to lead missions.

431
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,811
The lives of your squad
members are in your hands.

432
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:12,846
So you better be tough
enough to take the heat.

433
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:16,382
Delicate little girls
don't belong here.

434
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,984
-We're just thinning
out the heard.

435
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:18,952
You won't pass anyway.

436
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:21,154
So go home and play
with your dolls.

437
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,522
-Real nice speech.

438
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:26,692
Now both of you step
aside and let me through.

439
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,028
And while you're at it,
reverse the Genjutsu.

440
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:31,496
We can see through
your illusion anyway.

441
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,166
We're going to the third floor.

442
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,134
-What does he mean?

443
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,168
We're on the third floor.

444
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,469
-I know.

445
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:38,603
-Well, well.

446
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:42,040
-So you noticed
the Genjutsu, huh?

447
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:42,674
-Go ahead.

448
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,975
Tell them, Sakura.

449
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,177
I'm sure you saw it
before anyone else did.

450
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,745
-Huh?

451
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,547
-You have the sharpest eyes
and the best analytical skills

452
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,848
on our squad.

453
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,150
You must have seen this
coming a mile away.

454
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:55,953
-I must have?

455
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,855
Well, sure!

456
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:58,922
Of course.

457
00:18:58,956 --> 00:18:59,622
Sure!

458
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:00,690
I spotted it right away.

459
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,825
This is only the second floor.

460
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:03,344
-Right!

461
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,830
-Huh.

462
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,298
Well, aren't we the smart ones?

463
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,700
So you noticed an illusion.

464
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,471
Now let's see you
deal with this!

465
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:21,843
-[grunt]

466
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,578
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
How did he do that?

467
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,946
I thought he was some weakling
getting knocked around

468
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:26,881
like that.

469
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:30,117
But he's as fast as Sasuke.

470
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,385
-[grunt]

471
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,620
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
He stopped my kick.

472
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,289
That's some chakra
he's got in his arm.

473
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:36,256
-Hey.

474
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,791
What happened to the plan?

475
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,127
I thought you were the one
who said to keep a low profile

476
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,362
and don't let anyone
see our skill level.

477
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,630
-I know, but--

478
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,331
-Never mind, its over.

479
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,066
Forget it.

480
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,435
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Hey,
what happened to the bruises

481
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,569
he had before?

482
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:51,637
They're gone.

483
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,371
Were they fakes?

484
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,044
-My name is Rock Lee.

485
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,313
You are Sakura, right?

486
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,547
-Huh?

487
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,016
-Please be my girlfriend.

488
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,454
I vow to protect
you with my life.

489
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:12,189
-Definitely-- not.

490
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:12,790
-Hoy!

491
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:17,261
-Because you're a weirdo.

492
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:18,195
-Aw.

493
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:19,129
-[laughter]

Over here.

00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:22,766
What's your name?

-Hm?

[growl]

00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:26,202
Again?

00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:28,138
It's always about Sasuke!

501
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:31,074
-It's common courtesy to give
your own name before asking

502
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,041
someone else's.

503
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,143
-Hey, you're a
rookie, aren't you?

504
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:36,445
How old are you, anyway?

505
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,480
-I'm not obliged to answer.

506
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:40,049
-What's that?

507
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:41,383
-[giggle]

508
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:41,984
Cute!

509
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:48,557
-A weirdo?

510
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,658
-[groan]

511
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:52,326
No one wants to know my name.

512
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,862
-Hey, Naruto, Sasuke!

513
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:55,363
Come on.

514
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:56,364
Let's go.

515
00:20:56,397 --> 00:20:57,798
-Heh.

516
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:59,700
So that's the bunch of
misfits that Kakashi and Guy

517
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,201
have been going on about.

518
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,403
I guess they passed
their first test--

519
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,372
getting their
applications through.

520
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:07,374
-Right.

521
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:11,378
-It looks like the exams are
going to be fun this year.

522
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,144
-[sniff]

523
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:12,845
Yeah, for us.

524
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:16,883
But maybe not for them.

525
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,219
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): So this is
the big, bad Chunin exam, huh?

526
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:21,053
Heh.

527
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,121
It's a freak show.

528
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:42,406
[theme music]

529
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:51,180
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

530
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:54,517
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

531
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,820
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

532
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:01,290
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

533
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,963
My knee is still shaking
like I was twelve.

534
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:11,566
Sneaking out of the
classroom by the backdoor.

535
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,735
A man railed at
me twice, though.

536
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:14,969
But I didn't care.

537
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,405
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

538
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:21,943
Don't try to live so wise.

539
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:25,512
Don't cry because
you're so right.

540
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,282
Don't dry with fakes or fears.

541
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:32,052
Because you will hate
yourself in the end.

542
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,597
Don't try to live so wise.

543
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,533
Don't cry because
you're so right.

544
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,903
Don't dry with fakes or fears.

545
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:55,474
Because you will hate
yourself in the end.

546
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,843
Don't try to live so wise.

547
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,813
Don't cry because
you're so right.

548
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:03,981
Don't dry--

549
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:09,887
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Bowl cut,
bushy brows, and bug eyes!

550
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,622
This guy is freaky!

551
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,690
No wonder Sakura told
him to take a hike.

552
00:23:13,723 --> 00:23:14,992
The weird thing
is, they say he's

553
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:16,893
one of the best
fighters at the exams.

554
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:18,595
Well, I say prove it!

555
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:19,362
Bring it on!

556
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,430
Just you and me!

557
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:21,163
Hey!

558
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:21,831
You and me!

559
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:22,732
Not you and Sasuke!

560
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:23,666
What's wrong, weirdo?

561
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,134
You chicken?

562
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:28,847
Next time, Chunin Challenge--
Rock Lee versus Sasuke.

563
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,680
I don't care how good
he's supposed to be.

564
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:33,480
I still say he's a freak!
