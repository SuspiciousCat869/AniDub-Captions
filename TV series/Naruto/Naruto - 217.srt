1
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,130
-Gaara.

2
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,698
-Kankuro.

3
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,001
-Gaara.

4
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:43,701
-Primary Lotus!

5
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,607
-I'm at the end of my rope.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,976
I can't hold on any longer.

7
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:53,945
-[laughing]

8
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:55,780
-You're staring
death in the face.

9
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,482
Shouldn't you be
screaming for mercy?

10
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,884
Huh?

11
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,853
-[laughs]

12
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:04,455
-Now die!

13
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,224
-You're mine!

14
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,458
-You're gonna die, kid!

15
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:11,162
Wipe that grin off your face!

16
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:13,131
-[scream]

17
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:18,703
-What the--

18
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,677
-[scream]

19
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,046
-Who are you?

20
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:35,987
-What do you know?

21
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,990
Looks like we're
on the same side.

22
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:47,932
-Who are you?

23
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,535
-Allies of the Leaf Village.

24
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,903
-We're shinobi.

25
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,471
-Of the Sand.

26
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,454
-Yeah.

27
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:11,856
Well, careful getting home.

28
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:12,457
-OK.

29
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,696
-I'll see you next time
you need to be rescued.

30
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,599
Just let me know and I'll
come, you big crybaby.

31
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:23,701
-You girls are all alike.

32
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:27,138
You had to get the
last word in, huh?

33
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,107
-[laughing]

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,110
-Hmph.

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,679
-We owe you for that one.

36
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:37,048
Time we paid you back!

37
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:52,697
-What's up, Shikamaru?

38
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:54,599
What's the matter?

39
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,501
-We're going to
wait here for now.

40
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:57,535
-Wait here?

41
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:58,836
Are you out of
your mind, or what?

42
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,572
It's no time to
be taking a break.

43
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:02,740
-Put a lid on it, Naruto.

44
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,909
-[barking]

45
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:05,877
-That's right.

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,978
Shikamaru's leading
this mission,

47
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:08,479
not you, you knucklehead.

48
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:09,314
-Yeah.

49
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:09,814
Come on.

50
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,854
Get with it.

51
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:13,584
You have to obey
your leader, Naruto.

52
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:14,185
-Hmph!

53
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:14,785
Fine.

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,701
Whatever.

55
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,506
-I'm counting on you, Shino.

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,008
[theme song]

57
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,759
-What's happening?

58
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,194
Are they still coming?

59
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:30,662
-Oh, yes.

60
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,098
We made sure that by leaving
tracks, they couldn't miss.

61
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,167
They're hot on our
trail, all right.

62
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,175
It's perfect.

63
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,744
They'll be within range shortly.

64
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,513
There are three of
them, including Gaara.

65
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,182
-As for the other
two, divvy them up

66
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:53,618
however you like, and take
them on in one to one combat.

67
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:57,489
Meanwhile, I'll lure Gaara into
the reverse scale position.

68
00:05:57,522 --> 00:06:00,058
-OK, but I get
first crack at them.

69
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:00,692
-All right.

70
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:01,526
You're on.

71
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:18,577
-Hokyo's clever little plan is
a waste of time, if you ask me.

72
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,112
There's only three of them.

73
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,180
No reason I can't take
care of them myself.

74
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,520
Kujaku, double edged sword!

75
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,488
Tempest wind!

76
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:37,129
-What's going on?

77
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,665
-A wind user.

78
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:41,700
Just my thing.

79
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:00,819
-Excellent.

80
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,521
-Not bad, Temari.

81
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,022
-What did you expect?

82
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:05,123
-Not bad at all.

83
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:17,636
Not everyone can blow
away my tempest wind.

84
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,570
And look at you.

85
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,572
You're just a kid.

86
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,541
Ha.

87
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,942
-You two go on ahead.

88
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:24,976
-What?

89
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,112
You're good taking
her on by yourself?

90
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,647
-Are you sure of this?

91
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:29,181
-No problem.

92
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,483
We're two peas in a pod.

93
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:35,086
She and I are going to
swap wind jutsu techniques.

94
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,189
Get moving, Gaara.

95
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,158
Save your student.

96
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,526
-You're right.

97
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,594
Thank you.

98
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:43,595
-Be careful.

99
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:44,729
-Right.

100
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,531
-You're finished!

101
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,133
-I was about to
say the same thing.

102
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,668
Cyclone scythe jutsu!

103
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:56,908
-Wind slash!

104
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,084
-What kind of wind?

105
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,854
-My twin swords can twist
the wind in counter currents,

106
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,222
increasing its power.

107
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,191
You've only just begun
to see what I can do!

108
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,560
Having second thoughts?

109
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:18,663
With these, I need only
a fraction of my chakra.

110
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,599
You have to use all of yours.

111
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,501
How long can it last?

112
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,503
I guess we'll find out.

113
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,655
-Matsuri.

114
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:36,948
There they are.

115
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:37,949
-Where am I?

116
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:41,653
-So, you're awake.

117
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:42,787
Good.

118
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,824
You'll see the trap unfold
as you lure your teacher

119
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,659
right into it.

120
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,961
-Huh?

121
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:50,595
Gaara-sensei!

122
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,036
-Dragon eye, fang release!

123
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,037
Dark sword!

124
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,043
-What the heck?

125
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,664
-[laughing] What do you think?

126
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,234
Bet you've never seen
a sword like this one.

127
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:30,502
-He's just a kid!

128
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:34,573
Hmph.

129
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:35,640
I get it.

130
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:38,176
That sword's made up
of sections connected

131
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,180
by a wire running
through the center of it.

132
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,214
What do you know?

133
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,483
It's like one of
those bamboo snake

134
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,919
puppets I used to scare
people with when I was a kid.

135
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,058
What are you planning to
do with that kids' toy?

136
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:57,796
I hope you got something better
than that up your sleeve.

137
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,632
Because I'm warning you, little
man, when it comes to puppets,

138
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,601
you're playing with the master!

139
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,635
You go on ahead.

140
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:04,903
-I can leave him to you?

141
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:05,737
-Yeah.

142
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,571
Don't worry.

143
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,939
He's not worth your trouble.

144
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:08,907
I'll catch up with you.

145
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,209
-You got it.

146
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,145
-OK, sonny, I'll play with you.

147
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,748
-I wouldn't be so
confident if I were you.

148
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,651
It could be the last
mistake you ever make.

149
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,120
-Kid, you're going
to get a spanking.

150
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:26,725
-I'm going to wipe that
makeup right off your face!

151
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:27,492
-Let's play!

152
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:38,243
-Gotcha!

153
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,612
What, is that it?

154
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:52,183
I wasn't expecting
much, but come on.

155
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,120
Huh?

156
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,655
How did he--

157
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,526
-Now are you starting to get it?

158
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,095
This sword is hardly
a child's toy.

159
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,164
I only have to exert
a tiny bit of chakra,

160
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,166
and it amplifies it
tenfold and channels it

161
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,636
into the form of a dragon.

162
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,637
-Gaara, sorry.

163
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:18,576
This could take
longer than I thought.

164
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,179
-Suiko, this is the spot
to stop and ambush him.

165
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,248
Draw him into the
reverse scale position.

166
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,743
Got it?

167
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,302
-Got it.

168
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,529
[yelling]

169
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:41,800
[laughing] This is as
far as you go, Gaara.

170
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,469
Unless you go through me.

171
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,638
-If you insist, fine.

172
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,494
-Hey, Shikamaru!

173
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,696
How long are we
supposed to wait?

174
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,997
-Use your head.

175
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,766
You can't just throw
an ambush together.

176
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,801
You've got to set
it up, and it means

177
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,837
doing reconnaissance,
which is what Neji, Shino,

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,739
and Hinata are doing
for us right now.

179
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,974
-They're doing what?

180
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,486
-So you found them.

181
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,668
Byakugan!

182
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,366
-I see.

183
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,301
They're just up ahead.

184
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:49,898
Byakugan!

185
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,217
-Understood.

186
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,352
Three separate battle zones.

187
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,600
-This sack carries the
scent of the female.

188
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,202
As long as you keep
it on you, they'll

189
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,871
find you no matter how
far away you may be.

190
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,506
-OK, guys.

191
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,908
We're counting on you.

192
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,843
-We'll be off, then.

193
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,279
-Be careful.

194
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:33,913
-That's it.

195
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,648
The news I was waiting for.

196
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,482
-Good!

197
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,850
I was starting to cramp up.

198
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,617
-OK.

199
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,518
What's the word?

200
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,825
-Well, that's a drag.

201
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,961
Things have already
gotten started.

202
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,931
All right, Kiba and Choji
take to the west forest.

203
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,500
Ino and I will take the
hills to the northeast.

204
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,637
Naruto and Lee, take
the northwest forest.

205
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,607
We'll operate in
backup squads of two.

206
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,675
Ready?

207
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,344
Let's begin Operation
Return The Favor.

208
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,139
-Right!

209
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,846
-[bark]

210
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,882
-Finally some action!

211
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:10,649
-Move out!

212
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,563
-What is it?

213
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,332
-Let's hold up a minute.

214
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,469
If they're really
trying to get away,

215
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,938
why would they stop and
turn on their pursuers?

216
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,209
Take them one by one,
in separate battles.

217
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,378
Unless it's a trap!

218
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:39,878
-Huh?

219
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,747
-Just to be safe.

220
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,495
-That should do it.

221
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,262
Let's go.

222
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,218
-Right.

223
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,252
-Aww, nowhere left to hide,
and you feel helpless.

224
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,787
Poor thing.

225
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,356
-She can take everything
I throw at her.

226
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,758
I've got no choice.

227
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,326
I have to try it.

228
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:33,499
-Wind style sea dragon!

229
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,572
-I'm waiting.

230
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,941
Isn't something
supposed to happen?

231
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,477
[laughing] It
looks like the wind

232
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,579
has turned its back on you.

233
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,781
-I wouldn't be so sure.

234
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,221
The wind and I are good friends.

235
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,344
-Then let the battle
begin in earnest!

236
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:19,845
Wind reversal!

237
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,489
-[screaming]

238
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,764
-Get off!

239
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,734
Get off, you-- ugh!

240
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,901
-What a shame.

241
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:43,902
The game's over already?

242
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,339
I expected to have
a lot more fun.

243
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,241
-[grunting]

244
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,612
-Hm?

245
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,347
Now that's more like it.

246
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,357
I wonder what kind
of toy this is.

247
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:18,403
-[groaning]

248
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:18,937
-Ha!

249
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,339
You're so pathetic.

250
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,442
Is this silly little puppet
the only trick you have?

251
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:27,446
-Better than that piece
of junk you've got.

252
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,469
-Damn!

253
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,537
The dragon has three heads.

254
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,474
-You're quick, when
you're running away.

255
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,209
-It's no use.

256
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,578
Crow's playing at
a disadvantage when

257
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,613
he's not teaming up
with the black ant.

258
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:26,405
-Well done, Gaara of the Desert.

259
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:31,476
Just how much of your chakra
is that sand infused with?

260
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,445
-You really want to know?

261
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,849
Very well, but it's
gonna cost you your life.

262
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,456
Sand coffin!

263
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,709
-It can't be.

264
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,310
-Thank you.

265
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,879
That was very refreshing.

266
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,347
-But how?

267
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,983
How could you break out?

268
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,517
-It's my armor.

269
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,585
It absorbs chakra.

270
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,420
It feeds on it.

271
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,863
-Aww, are we tired?

272
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,999
Well, don't let me wake you.

273
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,367
You can sleep forever!

274
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,341
How did she--

-[groans]

my shadow possession jutsu.

277
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,299
-Playtime's over!

278
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,635
-Oh no.

279
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,236
-What?

280
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,888
-I-it's you guys!

281
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,357
-And who are you?

00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,626
-Who are you?

-Allies of the Sand.

-We're Shinobi.

285

-Of the Leaf Village!

286
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,832
-So you better watch out!

287
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,933
They're not here.

288
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:35,701
-Just up ahead!

289
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,569
-Right!

290
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,603
-Don't worry, guys.

291
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,672
It's a straight up battle.

No sign of chakra surges
anywhere in the valley.

There is no trap.

-Gaara-sensei.

-Hang on.

298
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,346
We're coming, Gaara.

299
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,349
We owe you one, and
we haven't forgotten!

So that's what these guys
have been after all this time.

Gotta hand it to
them, they're really

using the terrain
to their advantage.

If we don't turn the tables
quick, Gaara's in big trouble.
