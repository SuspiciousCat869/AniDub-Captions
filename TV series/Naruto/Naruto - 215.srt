anything that
happened in his past.

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,790
His memory is totally blank.

you know everything.

He's a filthy bandit.

And whether or not
he may have amnesia,

and I get this

-Listen, Neji's right.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,129
If we restore his memory
and get him to talk,

57
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,798
we can find out who those
attackers really were.

58
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,834
And if we use this guy
as a bargaining chip,

59
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,669
we might be able to
save your village.

He seemed like such
a kindhearted person.

78
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,598
But he's really a
low-life bandit?

00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,801
-Maybe the amnesia just made
him act like he was good.

that he has the same
markings as those guys did.

If he was evil deep
down inside, he

couldn't act that nice, even

-It worked for two places.

00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,597
-What?

172
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,965
They were here a second ago.

173
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:44,766
-It's like they just vanished.

Of course, that
strange tone mixed

177
00:09:58,146 --> 00:09:59,882
in with the sound of the wind.

178
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,584
They've got us in a genjutsu.

-Be careful, you two.

180
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,789
We've been put under some
kind of sonic genjutsu.

-You caught on too late.

You finished already?

That was easy.

197
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,396
I don't even have
a scratch on me.

198
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,096
Huh?

199

-I wasn't trying to hurt you.

200

back to the others.

-OK.

226
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,037
-Huh?

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,374
-Yeah.

231
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,643
-Hey, my buddies and I
took care of those bandits.

232
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,378
-But what about their leader?

233
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,413
What about Shiin?

234
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,582
-I-- yeah, sorry.

235
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:20,650
I chased after him,
but he got away.

236
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,718
-He did.

237
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,953
This is terrible.

238
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:24,487
Now that Shiin knows
the villagers haven't

239
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:27,324
fled the town, he'll
use his last resort.

240
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,326
Way up at the upper
end of the river,

241
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:33,430
there's a dam built to store an
emergency reservoir of water.

242
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,565
Even during an extended
drought, the village

243
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,769
would have plenty of water
resources to draw from.

244
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:42,472
His plan is to blow
the dam and sweep away

245
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:46,042
the entire village
with a giant flood.

246
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,344
-What?

247
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:50,013
-He doesn't care as long
as the mine is intact.

248
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:50,981
-Oh, man.

249
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,983
To stop a flood
that big, we'd have

250
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:55,085
to move a bunch of
mountains or something.

251
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,353
-Mountains?

252
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,654
[gasp]

253
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:58,688
That's it!

254
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:00,490
We need to move the mountains.

255
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,627
Naruto, you've got to
take me to the mine now.

256
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:04,861
-Wha--

257
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,730
-There should be a stash
of paper bombs kept

258
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:08,331
inside the mine.

259
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,399
-Paper bombs?

260
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:11,901
What are you planning
on doing with those?

261
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:13,970
-I'm going to blow
up the entire mine.

262
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,439
All that gravel and sand
will fill up the valley.

263
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,341
Maybe the flood
waters can be stopped.

264
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:24,914
-This is bad.

265
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:26,383
I hope we aren't too late.

266
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,485
We got to hurry, Menma.

267
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:31,755
-Uh, Naruto, there's something
that's been eating away at me,

268
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,323
and I need to tell you.

269
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:34,891
-Come on, can't it
wait till later?

270
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,627
-I-- I remember
everything about my past.

271
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,895
-That's great.

272
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:39,963
But right now, we got
to focus on stopping

273
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,098
this flood from happening, OK?

274
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:45,502
-No, this is something I've
got to get off my chest.

275
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:48,071
I lost both my parents
when I was very little.

276
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,074
And Shiin's clan took
me in and raised me.

277
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,009
Even though they were
a relatively small band

278
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:55,945
of shinobi in the
Land of Rice Paddies,

279
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,815
they made a name for themselves
because of their strong will

280
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:00,483
and determination.

281
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:03,887
However, about a year
ago, a new shinobi village

282
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,056
was founded in the
Land of Rice Paddies--

283
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,891
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

284
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:10,060
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The
Hidden Sound Village.

285
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:13,430
-One by one, Shiin's clan
lost their most skilled ninja.

286
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,599
They kept defecting over
to the Sound Village.

287
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,635
Before long, the
feudal lord stopped

288
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:21,771
hiring the clan altogether.

289
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,940
Shiin was still
leader of the clan.

290
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,342
He needed to
provide for his men.

291
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,912
So he set his sights
on this village's mine.

292
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:35,618
The plan was just to scare the
villagers and chase them off.

293
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,721
But they resisted.

294
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,423
And things turned ugly.

295
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:41,858
I wanted to escape.

296
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,761
I tried to run, but--

297
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,496
-What are you waiting for?

298
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:47,831
Did you forget what your job is?

299
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,733
Do I have to do it for you?

300
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:50,433
-Father!

301
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,289
Father!

302
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,071
Get up!

303
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,036
Father!

304

305
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:58,041
-Don't you touch her!

306
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,376
-Ugh!

307
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,746
You--

308
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:03,680
-Aah!

309
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,648
-Watch out!

310
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:07,617
[grunts]

311
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,318
Aah!

312
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,090
I'm one of them.

313
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,860
A member of a clan
full of criminals.

314
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:19,896
It would have been better
if I had fallen to my death.

315
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:23,533
At least, that ending
would have been a just one.

316
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,905
The image of all those
villagers dying at our hands

317
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,006
was too much.

318
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,076
I wanted to forget
every bit of it.

319
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:36,713
And so, like a coward, I used
a secret jutsu passed down

320
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,582
to the clan that
erases one's memory.

321
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:43,386
However, the jutsu didn't
work like it's supposed to.

322
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,687
It didn't last.

323
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,990
My vile memory came
flooding back to me

324
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,591
after only a few hours.

325
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:57,033
-Are you telling me you could
remember this whole time?

326
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,368
-I'm sorry.

327
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:58,835
-You!

328
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,436
Get off of me!

329
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,672
I can't believe you didn't
come clean and tell me

330
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:03,940
the truth from the get-go.

331
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:06,609
Your lies put a lot
more people in danger!

332
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,711
-The truth was too shameful.

333
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:12,382
I couldn't let our
clan's sins be known.

334
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,716
Don't you see?

335
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,353
I wanted to stop Shiin's group
from wreaking any more havoc.

336
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,888
-Uhh.

337
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:22,625
-That's why I was
pretending to have amnesia

338
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:27,363
so I could turn over a new
page and protect the village.

339
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,598
I needed help.

340
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,834
I thought if I could bring
the mighty Leaf Ninja here,

341
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,969
you would be able
to defeat them.

342
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:35,505
I knew what Shiin
was capable of.

343
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:37,740
And I knew I couldn't
stand by and watch

344
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,577
more innocent villagers die.

345
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,845
Fate spared my life.

346
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,480
And now, my purpose is
to save those people.

347
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,481
-Your purpose?

348
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,816
-Do you see now?

349
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,785
I had to tell you those lies.

350
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,420
I needed the help
of the Leaf Ninja

351
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:53,756
to stop Shiin from carrying
out his final plan.

352
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,892
-Huh?

353
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:58,595
-I was hoping to round them
all up during their raid

354
00:16:58,628 --> 00:16:59,996
on the village earlier.

355
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,765
But since I've come
this far, I guess

356
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,802
I'll have to stop the flood.

357
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,105
Naruto, thank you.

358
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,041
You'll have to take
care of Shiin for me.

359
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:15,511
No matter what happens,
you must stop him.

360
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:17,614
-Why are you giving me--

361
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,582
-Because this is goodbye.

362
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:23,052
Somebody has to set off the
paper bombs inside the mine.

363
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,354
-What?

364
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:25,788
If you do that, there's
no way you're going to--

365
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:28,758
-Thanks to you and your
friends, Naruto, my life

366
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:31,327
is going to mean something.

367
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,022
-Ugh!

368
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,522
Aah!

369
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,568
[rumbling]

370
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,036
-Oh, what's that rumbling?

371
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,906
-I'm sensing a chain of
large explosions occurring

372
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,374
upstream from here.

373
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,842
-But if the dam
breaks, the village

374
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,777
will be engulfed in a mudslide.

375
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,479
[murmurs]

376
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,781
-Neji.

[rumbling]

378
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:07,430
-Here comes the flood.

379
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,432
-[gasping]

380
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:17,407
Hm.

381
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,346
So long, my friend, Naruto.

382
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:29,652
-Menma!

383
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:30,353
No!

384
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:36,592
-Huh?

385
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,061
-Wha-- what's happening?

386
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:41,331
-It appears that the mountain
exploded and blocked the water

387
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:42,398
flow.

388
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:44,701
-So then, does that mean
the village is safe?

389
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,369
-It does.

390
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:47,837
-Oh, this is great.

391
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:02,885
-How could he?

392
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:05,521
How can he just
sacrifice himself?

393
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,022
Menma!

394
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,567
That scum.

395
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,634
He won't get away!

396
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:20,336
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

397
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,075
Hold it right there!

398
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:27,076
-What?

399
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,012
Another pest interfering
with my plan?

400
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:35,485
You think I'd fall for
that easy jutsu, huh?

401
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,823
Now, die!

402
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:48,631
-If Menma's not here
to defeat you, I will!

403
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:49,632
-What?

404
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:51,067
-Rotation!

-[grunts]

406
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,950
-He gave his life to
save these people.

407
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:11,687
-Despite his evil deeds in the
past, deep down he was good.

408
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,857
-Goodbye, mister.

409
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,760
-I owe him an apology.

410
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,063
-We didn't know it
then, but in the end,

411
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,799
wiping away that memory
was the only salvation

412
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:23,900
that Menma needed.

413
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,782
-Well, I promised you we'd
eat this ramen together.

414
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:41,851
And I always keep my word.

415
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:44,887
-So do you really think
he's going to be all right?

416
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,956
-If I know Naruto,
we only need to worry

417
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,891
if he loses that appetite.

418
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:51,360
Over time, he'll get
past this on his own.

419
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,496
-But until then,
he'll probably think

420
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:56,632
about losing his friend
whenever he eats ramen.

421
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,734
-And that's OK.

422
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:00,870
Bad memories stay
with us forever.

423
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:03,606
They even make us stronger.

424
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,408
It's how we grow as people.

425
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,851
-Man, that was so delicious.

426
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,593
Bye, Menma.
