1
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:11,282
[theme music]

2
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,082
-Does Moso really live here?

3
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:13,348
Come on, look at this place.

4
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,282
TENTEN: Yeah.

5
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:15,782
He's a very important official.

6
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,415
I expected luxury.

7
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,348
Golden sliding panels,
stuff like that.

8
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,648
NEJI: Keep your voices down.

9
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,615
You're being rude.

10
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,248
-No, it's quite all right.

11
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:27,715
The trappings of wealth and
power don't interest Lord Moso,

12
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:31,015
so he lives frugally, as
suits a man of his wisdom.

13
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:34,382
-Yeah, that's great and all, but
this is the most important guy

14
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,515
in the country after
the feudal lord, right?

15
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,415
So how come he acts
like he's broke?

16
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:39,282
-Naruto.

17
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:42,148
[laughing]

18
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:52,448
-My, my, how shameful of me to
receive you in such squalor.

19
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:55,848
-My Lord Moso.

20
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,782
-Huh?

21
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:59,682
You mean this old guy
who looks like he should

22
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,482
be working in some
dumpling shop?

23
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,082
[laughter]

24
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:07,182
-The old guy from some
dumpling shop, am I?

25
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:07,882
-Eh.

26
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:09,582
You gotta me kidding me.

27
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:10,848
-You idiot.

28
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:11,348
-Neji!

29
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,015
Hey!

30
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,915
What's the big idea?

31
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,648
-Please, my friends, make
yourselves comfortable.

32
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,082
It's a pleasure to meet you.

33
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,048
I take it you are the
ninja from the Village

34
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,448
Hidden in the Leaves?

35
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:25,282
-From your right, Lord, allow
me to introduce Naruto, Neji,

36
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:26,348
and Tenten.

37
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,982
-Hm.

38
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:30,915
I hear you came face to face
with a Cursed Warrior that

39
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:33,948
appeared in Lord Moso's
residence last night.

40
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,615
-Yes, we did.

41
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,482
-Well then, how did it go?

42
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:40,715
Did you figure out the true
identity of the Cursed Warrior?

43
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:42,115
-You betcha, we did.

44
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,815
Turns out it's a real ghost.

45
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,115
-A ghost?

46
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:46,515
Oh, you don't say.

47
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,215
-You shouldn't just assume that.

48
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:51,348
-But it appears out of
nowhere and flies around,

49
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,882
because it's a ghost, Neji.

50
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,148
-Yeah.

51
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,548
And don't forget how when
we knocked off his helmet,

52
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:56,748
the armor was empty.

53
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,415
-There's always a
rational explanation

54
00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,915
if you know where to look.

55
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,815
Sir, I'll give you my word.

56
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,882
I'll get to the bottom of this.

57
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:06,482
-Your resolve is
encouraging, young man.

58
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,615
we just installed
a new feudal lord.

59
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,782
This is no time for unrest.

60
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,548
Please eliminate these harmful
rumors of the Cursed Warrior

61
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,115
as soon as possible.

62
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:17,282
You are our only hope.

63
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,282
-Uh.

64
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,215
-I beg of you.

65
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:27,982
-Here are your chicken wings.

66
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:28,815
Dig in.

67
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,115
-You don't gotta tell me twice!

68
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,315
These look awesome!

69
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:39,815
That Moso dude seems like a
good guy, even if he is cheap.

70
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,048
-Oh yes.

71
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,782
For example, Lord Moso
allowed me to become a page,

72
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,648
saving me from poverty.

73
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:48,615
-The son assumes the throne
of his father, supported

74
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:51,482
and guided by a wise
second in command.

75
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:54,582
At first glance, it looks
like a stable government.

76
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,748
-What about the rumors
saying the old feudal lord

77
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:59,915
is back from beyond the
grave as the Cursed Warrior?

78
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:01,115
-Jealousy.

79
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:03,448
Maybe somebody doesn't
approve of the current feudal

80
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:04,882
lord having succeeded him.

81
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,582
-Got any idea who'd want
to say stuff like that?

82
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:13,415
-I hate to say it, but the
first one who comes to mind

83
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,782
is Lord Kome.

84
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,648
-You mentioned that name before.

85
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:19,515
That strategy guy who wanted
to become the big boss himself,

86
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,215
right?

87
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:21,648
-OK.

88
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,182
But then why would the Cursed
Warrior pay his place a visit?

89
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:27,682
-Maybe it was done to try
and deflect suspicion.

90
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:28,882
-You're a genius!

91
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,415
Yeah, that's gotta be it!

92
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:33,315
And, now that we figured
the whole thing out,

93
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:36,115
we nab old souffle or
toupee, or whatever

94
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:38,082
his name is, and
convince him to fess up!

95
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,015
Come on!

96
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,248
Pay for my wings and let's go!

97
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:42,382
-Idiot.

98
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,948
We can't just charge in
there without any proof.

99
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:48,182
-He is one of our
top strategists, so--

100
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,015
-Aw, man.

101
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,882
Way to spoil my fun.

102
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:54,848
-Your current feudal lord, Sagi.

103
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,215
I'd like to meet with him.

104
00:05:56,248 --> 00:06:00,248
-I'm sorry, but Lord Sagi isn't
seeing anybody at this time.

105
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:04,215
-Aw, but you and Sagi are
bosom buddies, well, ain't you?

106
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,415
Help us out.

107
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,815
come on, please?

108
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,948
-Childhood friend
is a bit better.

109
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:31,215
-Sitting out here's gonna
help us meet Sagi how?

110
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,548
-It's worth a shot.

111
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:36,715
Many of his fondness
memories are of this lake.

112
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:37,948
Many of mine, as well.

113
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:42,748
Back when we were
children, Lord Sagi

114
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:45,482
would always come here to play
with his little sister, Lady

115
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:45,982
Toki.

116
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:57,815
I figured he might come around
today with his attendants,

117
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:59,915
if we're lucky.

118
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:02,182
-Only if we're lucky, huh?

119
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:02,682
-Sh.

120
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:12,548
Look.

121
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:13,948
There he is.

122
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:14,448
-Huh?

123
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:42,729
-Excuse me, Lord Sagi.

124
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:43,796
We've arrived.

125
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,696
-Thank you.

126
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,163
-Wow.

127
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:49,963
So that's Lord Sagi, huh?

128
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:51,763
What a cutie.

129
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:52,963
He's definitely my type.

130
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:13,863
-My watch's hands haven't moved.

131
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:17,163
Not since that one
fateful moment.

132
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,196
-Hey.

133
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,163
What's he doing just
sitting in there?

134
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,929
-Thinking back to
happier days, probably.

135
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,629
His memories of Lady
Toki are the only thing

136
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:30,496
that can comfort
my Lord's heart,

137
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,263
and even that
comfort is fleeting.

138
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,263
-Byakugan!

139
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:45,196
NEJI (VOICEOVER): This
feeling of menace--

140
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:48,029
but where is it coming from?

141
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:50,463
If it's not above the ground--

142
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,096
-It's coming from there!

143
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:56,829
In the water!

144
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:02,463
-Assassins!

145
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:03,629
Protect Lord Sagi!

146
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,463
-Not today!

147
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:26,563
-All right.

148
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,063
Who the heck are
you clowns, anyway?

149
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:34,996
Darn it.

150
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,329
You're not getting away!

151
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:36,829
-Wait!

152
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:37,696
Naruto!

153
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,429
-Huh?

154
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,029
What am I waiting for?

155
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,396
-They set off a paper
bomb in the water.

156
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,063
-That was a close one.

157
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:00,729
Chased after them
any further, and that

158
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:03,929
would've been the end of you.

159
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:04,929
-Whoa there.

160
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,429
Whoa.

161
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,629
Easy now.

162
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,763
Lord Sagi.

163
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,196
Are you all right?

164
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:13,263
-Yes.

165
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:14,729
I am unhurt.

166
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:17,163
-I'm glad.

167
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,196
Lord Sagi, it's
my great pleasure

168
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,963
to introduce these ninja
from the Hidden Leaf village.

169
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,629
They have come to our
land to figure out

170
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:26,129
the true identity of
the Cursed Warrior.

171
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:28,029
-They shouldn't have bothered.

172
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:28,863
Let me guess.

173
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,296
This was Moso's idea, wasn't it?

174
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,429
-Yes.

175
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,596
Because he feared for
your life, Lord Sagi,

176
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,429
and with very good reason.

177
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:38,463
If these three hadn't
been here, then--

178
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,229
-Hold your tongue.

179
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,096
-Forgive me.

180
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:42,796
-Wait just a second.

181
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,029
Don't you realize how
dedicated this guy is?

182
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,563
You don't know how he feels.

183
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,929
Chishima cares about
you, even if you don't.

184
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:49,929
And this mission?

185
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,396
Man, we're working for peanuts!

186
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,663
But the Hidden Leaf
Village agreed to send us,

187
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,396
'cause this guy's
such a loyal friend.

188
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,063
-I don't require his help.

189
00:10:58,096 --> 00:10:59,663
-How very annoying.

190
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,329
-What did you say?

191
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,296
-That friendship is now
consigned to the past.

192
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,896
I have become a feudal lord,
but he remains the page

193
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,463
now and forever.

194
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,463
I have risen to great heights.

195
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,429
I can no longer see him.

196
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,829
-You dissin' friendship?

197
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:16,896
Go ahead, ya big snob,
and say it again.

198
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:18,563
I dare ya!

199
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:19,696
-No, Naruto!

200
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:20,396
-Hey, what gives?

201
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,929
Come on, let me go!

202
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:24,796
Guys like this are
just askin' for it!

203
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:26,629
-Guys like this
are feudal lords.

204
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,196
-Would that this shuriken had
buried itself in my throat

205
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:34,129
after all.

206
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:38,463
Proceed.

207
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,229
-Yes, my lord.

208
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,629
-Jeez, who does that
guy think he is, anyway?

209
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,596
-Gee, he's a feudal
lord, remember?

210
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,029
-Please try to find it in
your hearts to forgive him.

211
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,129
-Huh?

212
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,696
First that blowhard
called you worthless,

213
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,229
and now you're defending him?

214
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:03,063
-Sagi never used to
act like this before.

215
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,496
But his father and little
sister died one after another.

216
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,463
It was then that
his heart grew cold.

217
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,763
I understand.

218
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,496
-So that's what it was.

219
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,463
-But he'll turn back into
his old, kind self someday.

220
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:17,029
He just needs some time.

221
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:17,763
-Yeah.

222
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:19,596
I'm not holding my breath.

223
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:24,163
-The shuriken from before--
it has an odd shape, doesn't?

224
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:25,029
-Hm?

225
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,129
Let me take a look.

226
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:27,729
-Wait.

227
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:28,663
This weapon.

228
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,263
Is it familiar to you?

229
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,629
-Yes.

230
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,763
There are no ninja
in the Land of Birds,

231
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:37,429
but some of the guardsmen are
receiving special training.

232
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:39,796
-Do you think this is a
weapon those people would use?

233
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:40,796
-Yes.

234
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,463
-So then who commands
the guardsmen?

235
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:46,829
-Well, all of them answer
to the tactician, Lord Kome.

236
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:48,896
-Say what?

237
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:49,463
Kome again.

238
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:50,329
Yeah, I knew it.

239
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,492
NEJI: Use the Cursed
Warrior persona

240
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:11,659
to confuse the
public, this creating

241
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,959
a rift between
Lord Sagi and Moso.

242
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:18,259
Kome's original gambit
was divide and conquer.

243
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,592
But their relationship endured.

244
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,992
By Moso summoning
us here, Kome knew

245
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:24,992
this would all
soon come to light,

246
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:27,725
pushing him to try and
assassinate Lord Sagi.

247
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,659
-If we already figured out that
much charge, let's charge on in

248
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,625
and kick some tail.

249
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:33,759
-Hold your horses.

250
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,092
No charging.

251
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,659
Not until we find
the hard evidence

252
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,792
to support our hypothesis.

253
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,559
-So you're telling me
you want to be sure?

254
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:42,125
-And they said you
couldn't be taught.

255
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,059
-Neji.

256
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:45,959
Look at that.

257
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,092
-That's gotta be Kome.

258
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,525
I'd bet you anything.

259
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,059
-To think he'd go somewhere
without attendants,

260
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:03,392
even though the Cursed
Warrior might appear.

261
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,092
-All right.

262
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:04,925
Stay close.

263
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:31,392
-It's that temple, where
the Cursed Warrior showed up

264
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,225
last night.

265
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:33,659
-Something's fishy about this.

266
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:59,192
[gasp]

267
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,359
-He appeared again!

268
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:00,859
-Shh!

269
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,625
-Byakugan.

270
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:17,392
What?

271
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:18,025
It can't be.

272
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,592
-There.

273
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,225
Hard evidence.

274
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:21,459
See, I'm charging!

275
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:21,959
-Hey!

276
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:22,459
Naruto!

277
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:29,292
-I'm on to you, and
your so-called ghost!

278
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,925
-Who's back there?

279
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,459
-The jig is up, Kome.

280
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,259
The Cursed Warrior is
just one of your flunkies.

281
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,625
Yeah, what do you think of that?

282
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:39,692
-Excuse me?

283
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:55,259
-Where do you
think you're going?

284
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,292
-Naruto!

285
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:56,892
Get down!

286
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:09,025
-Bulls-eye!

287
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:10,325
Yeah, I got him!

288
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,225
-He's still kicking!

289
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,359
Not only is it a ghost,
but it's a ghost in armor

290
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:20,859
who knows how to take a hit!

291
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,625
-He made a whirlwind?

292
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:43,459
-Darn it!

293
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,492
Now I can't even see
the Cursed Warrior.

294
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:51,725
-Byakugan!

295
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,025
Shuriken shadow clones?

296
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,192
Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!

297
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,625
Are you going to help,
or just stand there?

298
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:17,825
-Sorry.

299
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,959
I just never thought a
ghost could use ninjutsu.

300
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:20,892
-Listen.

301
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,759
It's not a ghost
inside that armor.

302
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,959
It's a ninja.

303
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:27,759
And quite a wily one, at that.

304
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,359
-This matches the shuriken
they threw at Lord Sagi

305
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:31,125
earlier today.

306
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,425
-He knows everything
that's going on.

307
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:37,892
We need him alive.

308
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:38,825
-I understand.

309
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:39,792
I'm on it!

310
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,659
-It doesn't matter
what this guy knows

311
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,325
if we can't get through that
whirlwind and take him down.

312
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:52,825
-Naruto.

313
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:53,325
-Huh?

314
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,692
-Don't let me down.

315
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:01,625
-All right.

316
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,159
I'll give it my best shot!

317
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:05,425
-Hey, Tenten!

318
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,859
Keep his attention
focused on you.

319
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:08,725
Hit him with
everything you've got!

320
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,225
-Roger!

321
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:21,759
No good!

322
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,725
I didn't even scratch him!

323
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,759
-That's fine!

324
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:25,992
Just keep doing it!

325
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:44,592
-Now, Neji!

326
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,659
Time to do your thing!

327
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:56,392
-Gentle Fist Art, Eight
Trigrams, 64 Palms.

328
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:59,792
Two Palms!

329
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:01,125
Four Palms!

330
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,059
Eight Palms!

331
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,192
16 Palms!

332
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:04,892
32 Palms!

333
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:08,725
64 Palms!

334
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:15,559
-All right!

335
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:16,792
We did it, you guys!

336
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,859
-And this time we get to
see who's hiding in there.

337
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,559
-Why don't you take off
that mask and say howdy?

338
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:29,925
Huh?

339
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:34,859
-What is that stuff?

340
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:51,092
-Anyone else freaking out
that it's empty again?

341
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,359
-No-- this isn't possible.

342
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,159
MAN: Lord Kome,
we've confiscated

343
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:09,292
a suit of white armor, and a
number of guardsmens' shuriken

344
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,092
from a storeroom
within your residence.

345
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:17,425
The Cursed Warrior incident
and the assassination attempt

346
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:20,359
against Lord Sagi were both
orchestrated by one man,

347
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:22,325
and you're the prime suspect.

348
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,559
We're bringing you in.

349
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:27,059
Will you go quietly?

350
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,292
-I have no choice.

351
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,059
-Thank you all so very much.

352
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:46,659
I can't imagine
but that this will

353
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,125
help set Lord Sagi's
heart at easy.

354
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,792
-Looks like our work
in this town is done.

355
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,325
-Those guardsmen don't
waste any time, do they?

356
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,992
I mean, we only contacted
Lord Moso with all this

357
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,859
about an hour ago.

358
00:20:58,892 --> 00:20:59,959
NEJI: It was different.

359
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,659
-Huh?

360
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:04,125
-Tonight's Cursed
Warrior was different.

361
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,125
There was an energy inside,
from a living, breathing human.

362
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,592
-A human being?

363
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,025
-But you said you
didn't feel anything

364
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,292
like that when we
fought him last night.

365
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:17,559
-I know.

366
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:19,292
-So the vibe was different.

367
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,459
OK, what does that mean to us?

368
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:26,094
-It means, there isn't
one of them, but two.

369
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:31,760

370
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,093
-Why are we returning
to the village?

371
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:06,393
We don't know what's
really going on.

372
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,826
If we're gonna investigate,
we just start here, right?

373
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,960
What?

374
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:14,526
I wonder if this weird
thing is-- Oh, I get it!

375
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,426
To think he'd use
this to get around!

376
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,626
Pretty clever there,
Cursed Warrior.

377
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,326
Huh?

378
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,826
Why did it appear here?

379
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,226
Next time, Too Late For Help!
