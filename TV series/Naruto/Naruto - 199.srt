[gasps]

3
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:00,796
-Naruto, Choji, get 'em, quick!

4
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:01,765
-Oh, yeah.

5
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,533
Right.

6
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:03,836
We're on it.

7
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,538
-Um.

8
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,518
-Multi-Shadow Clone jutsu!

9
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:13,825
[clones yelling]

10
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,662
-Partial Expansion jutsu!

11
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:31,864
Ah!

12
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:34,336
Uh, unh, got it, got
it, got it, got it!

13
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,507
-Huh? (THINKING) Where
did that bird go?

14
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:42,821
No use.

15
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,190
It's long-gone.

16
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:44,825
-There!

17
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,897
Got two more.

18
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,832
Unh.

19
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:48,834
Eh!

20
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,771
Ah.

21
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,375
I'll get you!

22
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,415
[screaming and panic]

23
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,184
OK, OK.

24
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:56,952
Sorry!

25
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:57,620
Sorry!

26
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:02,197
Careful.

27
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,934
That's really important.

28
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,473
You think I could play
with that for a sec?

29
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:07,241
It's OK.

30
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,477
Let go, let go, let go!

31
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:11,249
[crying]

32
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,388
-Lady Tsunade,
we've got trouble!

33
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,657
-What is it Shizune?

34
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,495
-Those papers
falling from the sky

35
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:19,501
were actually the stolen plans
we've been looking forward.

36
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:21,673
Shikamaru and his squad
have been collecting them

37
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,478
from all over the village
and gathering them together.

38
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:27,485
It appears they've
recovered all of them.

39
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:28,988
-So what do you think it means?

40
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:30,491
-Who knows?

41
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,364
-Lady Tsunade, we've just
had word from the forces

42
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,767
that we sent to the border.

43
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,471
-Well, what's the news?

44
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,475
-It seems the troop
movements we detected

45
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:41,382
were just part of a
training exercise after all.

46
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,019
The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls

47
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,256
had no intention of invading us.

48
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,493
-They what?

49
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,762
-They finished their
training and the troops

50
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,265
withdrew without incident.

51
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,537
All's quiet on the border.

52
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:53,909
-So there was no connection
between that and Genno

53
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,412
after all.

54
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:58,586
Suspend the security alert,
and order everyone back!

55
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,958
All our forces are to
return to the village.

56
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,697
-Right.

57
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,672
-Just what is our
friend Genno up to?

58
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:11,347
[growling] Ah!

59
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,661
-[whimpers]

60
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:18,295
-Lady Tsunade!

61
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:18,930
-(IRATE) Yeah?

62
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:20,600
What is it now?

63
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:21,837
-Uh.

64
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,978
The body that the Anbu Black
Ops thought was Genno's--

65
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,015
CHOJI: What?

66
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:30,489
It's not Genno?

67
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:32,793
What do you mean, it's not him?

68
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:33,996
-But wait.

69
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,433
I thought old man
Genno blew himself up

70
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,537
when the Black Ops
had him surrounded.

71
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,475
-Maybe he was ready for that.

72
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:43,083
Maybe he had someone else's body
ready to switch for his own.

73
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,452
-Yeah.

74
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,722
That's what it's
starting to look like.

75
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:47,893
It's a similar body type
to Genno's, but there

76
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,330
are distinct differences.

77
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,869
They're still examining it.

78
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:52,537
-Umh.

79
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:58,350
-In short, it's
not who we thought.

80
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,991
-So the Anbu were
totally fooled, huh?

81
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:04,463
-But then, where is the man now?

82
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,902
-After all that, the
old man's still alive?

83
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,371
-Yeah.

84
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,543
And I'd give anything to
know what he was up to.

85
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,945
-Try over there.

86
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:30,887
Go look under that fallen tree.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,991
-Unh, uh ah.

88
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:39,539
-So that's it.

89
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,911
Old man Genno had an escape
tunnel waiting for him here

90
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:43,548
all the time.

91
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:44,950
-He disguised it well.

92
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:47,022
We might never have found
it without Neji's byakugan.

93
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,498
-Yeah, and look at this.

94
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,435
He designed the tunnel
so it would slowly

95
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,941
collapse on itself from
the weight of the dirt.

96
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,879
In another day or so,
we would have never

97
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:02,689
been able to find,
even with the byakugan.

98
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,594
There wouldn't have
been a trace of it.

99
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:08,101
He went to a lot of trouble
to cover his tracks.

100
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,404
-OK, boy.

101
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,907
See if you can
pick up his trail.

102
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,083
[whimpers]

103
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,152
-Oh.

104
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,622
-Look at that.

105
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,561
The wily old man even
covered up his scent.

106
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,633
-Where could Genno
be now, I wonder?

107
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:32,755
-From what we know
so far, we have

108
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:36,062
to assume Genno is still
alive, and possibly

109
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,766
hiding right here
in the village.

110
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,138
-Uh.

111
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:43,111
-First, he stole the
plans, then staged

112
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:45,616
an elaborate phony suicide.

113
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,888
He might have been hoping
to draw our attention away

114
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:49,625
from the village.

115
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,963
All that activity on
the border was a help.

116
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,535
He must have known the Village
Hidden in the Waterfalls

117
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,872
was planning that.

118
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:56,874
-Uh.

119
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:00,014
-But remember, we
only suspected him

120
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:02,620
because of the fake
letter of recommendation.

121
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,624
And it was only by
sheer coincidence

122
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,729
that we discovered the letter.

123
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,766
-Was it a coincidence?

124
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:11,840
It was convenient that a
real letter of recommendation

125
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:15,614
was found in the very
house Genno was working at.

126
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,187
A little too convenient,
if you ask me.

127
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,857
-Oh. [gasp]

128
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,625
-All right, then.

129
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,697
What is he really after?

130
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,035
-If we knew that, we wouldn't
be sitting here sweating,

131
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,171
would we, M'lady?

132
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:27,207
-Shikamaru!

133
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,645
-But one thing we do know.

134
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,649
The number of Shinobi
left in the village

135
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,690
now is pathetically low.

136
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,527
Everybody but the
back-up squad has

137
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,066
been sent away on
a wild goose chase.

138
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:42,740
And everyone here is looking
for the threat from the outside.

139
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:45,780
Old man Genno could be
walking the streets right now,

140
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:48,152
whistling a tune,
and we wouldn't even

141
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:49,856
know a thing about it.

142
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,729
-So you think he's planning
something here in the village?

143
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,001
-Is that why he scattered
the plans around?

144
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:57,907
Because he's already
finished setting his trap?

145
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,712
-I think that was just
another diversion.

146
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,187
Another way of keeping us
running around in circles.

147
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:07,027
-If he did set a trap, we'll
have to find it ourselves.

148
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,699
All our defenses are
already thin enough.

149
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,136
But where do you look?

150
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,340
And where do you even start?

151
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:14,710
-With the Academy.

152
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,080
-The Academy?

153
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,351
Of all the buildings in
the village, what makes

154
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,188
you think the Academy
is his target?

155
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:23,162
-Because of all the building
sites Genno worked on,

156
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:26,302
the Academy is the only one
whose plans were stolen.

157
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,171
-Mm.

158
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:29,008
Another coincidence?

159
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,043
I don't think so.

160
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:39,865
-Byakugan!

161
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,962
-Well?

162
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:55,031
-Uh-uh.

163
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:58,806
I see nothing unusual is
this part of building.

164
00:08:58,839 --> 00:08:59,841
-Oh.

165
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,147
Well, then, we'll
move onto the next.

166
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:02,815
-Byakugan!

167
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:11,367
No.

168
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,703
There's nothing in this room.

169
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,073
-Can't you and
Hinata do some kind

170
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:16,077
of quick scan of the
whole place at once?

171
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,315
It would save a lot
of time, you know?

172
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:21,789
-If we just knew what we
were looking for, then maybe.

173
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:23,660
But since we
haven't a clue, it's

174
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:27,134
safest to go slow,
one section at a time.

175
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,036
[laughing]

176
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:28,637
-Gang way.

177
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:29,272
Coming through.

178
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,074
-Out of the way.

179
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:30,743
-Coming through!

180
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:31,644
-Out of the way!

181
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,013
-Huh.

182
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:36,187
And with these kids around,
it makes it even harder.

183
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,791
-So now do you understand?

184
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,063
That's why you've
all got to clear out.

185
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,933
Everybody go outside
on the double!

186
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,437
-Well, that isn't what
our teacher told us.

187
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,311
He said we're supposed to study
in the classroom all day today.

188
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:48,915
-That's right.

189
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:50,919
We're not supposed to leave
the room, no matter what!

190
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:52,689
-Look, it's just
for a little while.

191
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:54,093
Your teachers will never know.

192
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,367
They're all away on an
important mission, OK?

193
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,004
Tell you a secret.

194
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:01,776
When I was your age and Iruka
Sensei wasn't watching me,

195
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,948
I used to sneak out
of class all the time!

196
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:04,448
-Huh?

197
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:05,718
You played hooky?

198
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,189
-Juvenile delinquent!

199
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:08,457
[students all protesting]

200
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,094
-Uh?

201
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:10,830
Whatever.

202
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,466
Will you just clear out?

203
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,841
-Anyway, if everyone's been
sent on a big important mission

204
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:18,045
to defend the
village, how come you

205
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,283

hanging around here?

206
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,254
-Are you losers or something?

207
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,824
-(IRRITATED) Hey, hang on!

208
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:26,463
What we're doing is defending
the village, too, OK?

209
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:29,403
-Naruto, you're just
wasting your time.

210
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:31,307
I'll handle this.

211
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,309
-You will?

212
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:34,481
-(YELLING) Expansion jutsu!

00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:35,416
-Uh-oh!

214

Watch out!

-I'm going to the
teacher on you!

00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,070
-(YELLING) Now get of here!

218
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,743
Go on!

219
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,081
-Hey, let's go and work
on our kunai training!

220
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:50,950
-Good idea!

221
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:57,865
-I didn't find anything.

222
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:00,237
It looks all clear up here.

223
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,207
[kids yelling happily]

224
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,413
-Hurry up!

225
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,050
-Let's go!

-Woohoo!

-Huh?

00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:12,430
-Hey!

230
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,165
Hey!

231
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,335
Come on.

232
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:17,174
You guys have all got to
clear out of here right now!

233
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:18,042
-Naruto.

234
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:19,346
-Yeah?

235
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,783
-Those kids, the ones running
off toward the practice hall

236
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:24,457
just now, what do you
think they're up to?

237
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,026
-Don't know.

238
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,135
-I heard him say something
about some kunai training.

239
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:30,870
-That's right!

240
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,006
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,946
I think I heard
something like that.

242
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:37,318
-A strange place indeed
for kunai training.

243
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:46,003
STUDENT: Hurry up!

244
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,039
STUDENT: Do it already.

245
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:47,840
STUDENT: Just throw it already.

246
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,077
STUDENT: Hello?

247
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:49,979
STUDENT: Just stop,
let me concentrate!

248
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:50,981
STUDENT: It's my turn.

249
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,083
STUDENT: Yeah, there you go.

250
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,386
STUDENT: Oh, that
was a nice shot.

251
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,855
-Uh, uh!

252
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:55,825
-Nice try.

253
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:56,426
-Wow!

254
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,931
Seriously.

255
00:11:58,964 --> 00:11:59,833
-Look at them.

256
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,103
They're really training.

257
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,040
Remember when we
were at the Academy?

258
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:07,349
We used to skip class and
hang out here all the time.

259
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:09,855
It was the last place
the teachers ever thought

260
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:14,264
of looking for us.
[chuckles] It was great!

261
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:17,071
I used to read manga
here, or take a nap.

262
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,844
-A nice quiet place
to eat a snack.

263
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:21,948
-I would not boast about that.

264
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:24,120
You could learn
something from them.

265
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,124
Look at them, training
hard, even when

266
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:27,594
the teacher is not watching.

267
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:28,863
-Unh!

268
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:31,268
-The picture of
the ideal student.

269
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,338
Uh!

270
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,475
(PASSIONATELY) Such
drive and dedication.

271
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,146
It is inspiring to watch.

272
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,351
I only wish I could
go through training

273
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,188
all over again with them!

274
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,023
-Yeah.

275
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,225
-We must not interrupt them.

276
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,595
Let us be off!

277
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,664
-OK.

278
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,401
-Hey, Naruto.

279
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,170
-Yeah?

280
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,272
What is it?

281
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,343
-That thing didn't used
to be there, did it?

00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:51,479
-Huh?

283
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,147
Uh.

284
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:00,566
-OK.

285
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,501
Watch this.

286
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,670
I'm going to nail it!

00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:05,309
-Huh?

00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,581
-Um-eh!

-Hey, that one was
right on the target!

-It looks new, like it
was placed here recently.

-You think Genno
might have done it?

-Wait!

I know.

299

I'll find Neji or Hinata
and they can check it out.

00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:25,486
Do you mind?

302
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,323
Get out of the way.

Where?

-A paper bomb hidden
inside this wall.

-Inside?

317

But how could-- well, how could
anybody detonate it in there?

00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,780
I don't know what to say,

335
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,350
-I need you, Hinata.

336
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:29,325
-Ah, Naruto, I never knew
you could be so impetuous.

337
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,263
-[growls] Oh.

338
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,372
Never mind.

339
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:36,708
I'll ask Neji.

340
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,278
See ya!

341
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,280
-Huh?

342
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:39,736
Oh.

343
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,465
-The paper bomb has a long
thread attached to it.

344
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:48,600
-A thread?

345
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,204
-Not just any thread.

346
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:53,411
More than likely, it's
a fuse, allowing someone

347
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:55,449
to set off the
bomb from far away.

348
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,319
-Well, thread, or
fuse, or whatever

349
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,622
it is, where does it lead to?

350
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:14,056
NEJI: It goes around the
classroom, then goes outside,

351
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:17,831
and it ends in
the practice hall.

352
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,468
There's something there.

353
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,172
A log, or a pole.

354
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:25,781
The booby trap.

355
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:27,752
That's it!

356
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:28,754
-Uh.

357
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,757
Neji!

358
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,692
Hurry.

359
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,229
You've got to with me!

360
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,166
-We're in the middle of
something kind of important

361
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,435
here, Naruto!

362
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,172
-There's this weird kind
of log thing standing up

363
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,276
in the practice hall.

364
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,215
We need to come
and check it out!

365
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,085
-It's an explosive device.

366
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,422
-Huh?

367
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:47,496
STUDENT: Heh!

368
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:50,201
-Try loosening up your
shoulder before you throw.

369
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,105
-Who asked you?

370
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,609
-Stand aside.

371
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,381
I'll show you how to do it.

372
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,485
NEJI: Does the log
have a target on it?

373
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,189
-Yeah, exactly.

374
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:03,463
-The center of that
target is the detonator.

375
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,267
-Hyah!

376
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,405
NEJI: If a kunai knife
hits that bullseye,

377
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,646
it will trigger the
detonator and the Academy

378
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,850
will be blown sky-high.

379
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,520
-Oh, so close.

380
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:15,890
Do not forget to focus.

381
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:18,663
Focus on the target, boys.

382
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:19,665
-All right.

383
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,603
I'm going to nail It this time.

384
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,581
Focus, focus.

385
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:28,218
Here we go!

386
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,455
-Let's hope their aim's
not getting any better!

387
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:44,887
-I've got it.

388
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,159
Bullseye!

389
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:47,693
-Bravo!

390
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:49,564
Well-done!

391

[metal clinking]

392
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:53,572
-What the--?

393
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,911
-There must be a
flaw in the blade.

394
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:56,946
Yes, indeed.

395
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,450
Let that be a lesson to you.

396
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,788
You must take good
care of your weapons.

397
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:01,490
-Hey!

398
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:02,225
No fair!

399
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:03,828
That was a bullseye!

400
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:04,629
-This way.

401
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:05,465
It's shorter!

402
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,536
Hurry!

403
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,605
-OK.

404
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,674
I got it now.

405
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,612
This one's going to
be right on the money.

00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,950
-That is the spirit!

-Ha!

00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,959
-That one looks good!

409
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:18,694
There it is.

-Oh.

418
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,629
Did I scare you guys?

419
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:35,998
My bad.

420
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,936
I dropped one of my ninja tools.

Ah.

425
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:47,924
-Way to go, Bushy Brow.

426
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:48,960
Nice stop!

427
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:49,829
-Hey!

428
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,298
That was a bullseye!

-Why do you guys keep
butting in, anyway?

-(ANGRILY) Quiet you brats!

If you had hit the
bullseye, the whole Academy

432
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,614
would've blown up!

-A triggering device
hidden inside it, huh?

438
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:15,751
-Cleverly set to be activated
by a direct hit on the target.

439
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,856
-We were just lucky that
none of those little snots

440
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,528
was good enough to hit
it before we got here!

441
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:23,067
-It's a good thing they
hadn't had any more training.

-Hey, you guys!

444
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,283
Who was it that told you to do
your kunai training in here?

445
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:31,953
You remember?

-Who was it again?

Hey, do you remember?

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,563
-No.

449
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:37,832
But somebody told us we should
do our training in secret

450
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,771
and impress our teacher.

451

-Training in secret, huh?

452
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,482
-Whoever it was must have
used some kind of genjutsu

453
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,854
to put that thought
in the kids' minds.

-I don't know what
it means, but I

00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,419
was looking at the
explosive device

459
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:05,593
and there's more than
one fuse leading to it.

-What?

461
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,765

Wait.

00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,762
-We've got to
evacuate the village!

503
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:12,764
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): No.

504
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:13,633
Then he'll know we're onto him.

505
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,969
-So what do we do?

506
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,305
SHINO (VOICEOVER): Act
like everything is normal,

507
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,909
as we quietly defuse the bombs.

508
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:18,810
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Exactly.

509
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:19,679
Let's get to work.

510
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,049
-(BOTH) Right!

511
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,737
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "The Powerful Helper".
