JIRAIYA: At the base of
these mountains here,

3
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,303
we can stop at the
most bustling outpost

4
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:00,070
in all the Land of Rice Paddies.

5
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,337
NARUTO: Aw, you're just
looking for crazy hot spots

6
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,103
in the name of
research, Pervy Sage.

7
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,703
-Yeah, enough's enough already.

8
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,237
We were barely able to
shake off the bodyguards

9
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,137
from the last place
you dragged us to.

10
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,503
-Mm-hm.

11
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:13,903
[sigh]

12
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:15,270
-Listen, you two.

13
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,570
I know what you're saying, but
we don't have a choice here.

14
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:21,003
This is the only way to find
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

15
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,870
I don't like it any better
than you do, all right?

16
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:26,603
Still, that's the
predicament we're in.

17
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,037
Sometimes you have to stomach
things you might not like.

18
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,403
And I'm just the man to do it.

19
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:34,803
OK, let's go!

20
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:36,003
Come on, you slowpokes.

21
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,537
Quit dragging those feet.

22
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,103
Investigation.

23
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,070
Investigation.

24
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,503
What a chore!

25
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:41,603
Investigation--

26
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:42,970
-Peppy, isn't he?

27
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:44,737
-You can't teach an
old dog new tricks.

-Aw, man.

33
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,970
Look at this dump.

34
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:05,937
It's even worse
than the last one.

35
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,937
-Seriously.

36
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,070
Let's just pass on
through this place

37
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:09,970
and keep looking for the
Hidden Sound village.

-So, uh--

41
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,837
-Look, I don't have
anymore money, OK?

42
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,003
-Yeah, forget it.

43
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,403
I don't have any
money left, either.

44
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:29,837
-Here.

45
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,003
I want you guys to go
get some food with that,

46
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,070
and wait in the temple
on the outskirts of town.

47
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:42,203
Information tends to
gather in places like this,

48
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,937
but I won't corrupt the
eyes of the innocent.

49
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,037
I'll sacrifice myself, and see
what I can dig up around here.

50
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:54,203
-He sure has a good
heart, doesn't he?

51
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,470
-Gee, Sakura.

52
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,770
You really are
naive, you know that?

53
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:02,003
-Let's see where I should start.

54
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:03,103
Hi!

55
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,403
This investigation's
gonna be rough on me!

56
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:06,870
Let's hope I can handle it!

57
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:08,337
Ha ha ha ha!

58
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,670
-Let the Pervy
Sage do his thing.

59
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:12,337
We can have a look
around on our own.

60
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:15,937
What's up?

61
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,037
Is something wrong, Sakura?

62
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:24,603
-I don't think Sasuke
is in this land anymore.

63
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:26,203
-Hey, what are
you talking about?

64
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,837
We can't be sure of
anything until we've

65
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,270
had a good look around.

66
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,637
-Yeah, I know.

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,870
NARUTO: We're dealing
with Orochimaru here.

68
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,203
We knew what would be difficult.

69
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,970
But it doesn't matter.

70
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:46,337
I mean, we're definitely
going to find him, Sakura.

71
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,003
-You're right.

72
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:50,870

00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,937
-Hey, you're the
one from before!

74
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:01,837
-Something's wrong.

75
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,270
I think he's been injured.

76
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,237
-What happened to you?

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,737
-Naruto!

78
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,170
-Heh, heh, heh.

79
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:26,670
Huh?

80
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,003
Substitution, huh?

81
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,370
We let them get away.

00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:41,937
-Don't worry.

84
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,270
My beloved little children here
are spinning a trail for us

85
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,303
to follow.

86
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:50,303
There's no way they
can escape us now.

87
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:54,070
[laughter]

88
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,970
-Those two were ninja,
from beyond the border.

89
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,203
The fools.

90
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:00,470
Wandering into our backyard
has sealed their fate.

91
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,870
-A pity.

92
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,003
Anyone skulking
around in this land

93
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:07,537
could only be looking for
Lord Orochimaru, anyway.

94
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,570
[laughter]

95
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,637
JIRAIYA: Oh, ho!

96
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,870
Oh, man.

97
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,270
Nothing beats the supple
skin of a young woman, huh?

98
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:33,703
-Some gentleman.

99
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:34,437
-Huh?

100
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,570
Oh, sorry, sorry.

101
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:38,337
Hey, by the way,
you ladies haven't

102
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,370
heard any rumors about the
Sound village lately, have you?

103
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:42,570
-Where's the Sound village?

104
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,770
-Never heard of it.

105
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,870
You must be mixed up, mister.

106
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:46,703
Aw, come on.

107
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:48,337
I'll make it worth your while.

108
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,703
-Huh?

109
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:53,037
-But I told you, I
don't know nothing.

110
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,237
-Yeah, I've never
heard of it either.

111
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,403
WOMAN: I've heard of it.

112
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:59,437
-Hm?

113
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,703
-One of my regulars knows
all about it, actually.

114
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:04,503
Coming?

115
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:05,370
-Mm-hm.

116
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,170
-Aw.

117
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:09,570
-He lives down at the
end of this alley.

118
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:10,370
-Uh huh.

119
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:17,837
Hm?

120
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,137
Here we go.

121
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,370
-Caught like a rat in a trap.

122
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,770
-This guy's just
some mangy old dog.

123
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:36,637
You said this dodger's
got money on him?

124
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,937
-Sure does.

125
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,370
Saw the cash with
my very own eyes.

126
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:41,570
-You idiots.

127
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:45,970
Quit your yapping and
take this guy out already.

128
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:46,837
-Kay, boss.

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,737
You got it.

130
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:57,570
-You shouldn't have let a woman
lead you by the nose like that.

131
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,370
Now say goodnight!

132
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:08,570
-Huh?

133
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:15,403
-Ninja Art, Needle Jizo!

134
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,737
-Bastard.

135
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,670
-Look, fellas, I'm in a bit
of a hurry at the moment.

136
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:28,003
So what's say we
cut to the chase?

137
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,537
You play nice and
tell me what you

138
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,737
know about the Sound village
and, if you're lucky,

139
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,003
I'll let you walk out of here.

140
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:36,203
-If you think I'm gonna
play nice with you,

141
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:39,337
grandpa, then you
must be a fool.

142
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,670
You're a ninja then.

143
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,703
-And if I am?

144
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,703
-Well, now, this is interesting.

145
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:49,137
We've been reduced
to thievery of late,

146
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,003
but we're actually a
pretty well known clan

147
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,337
of shinobi in these parts.

148
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,337
I could just take your life.

149
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,003
But how about I
hire you instead?

150
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,870
-So you're a ninja, huh?

151
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:05,670
Then I don't need
to go easy on you.

152
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:08,737
-I don't think you wanna be
playing the big shot, old man!

153
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,503
-Shut up, you little punk!

154
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,770
A shinobi always endures.

155
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,803
Those who would use the jutsu
they worked so hard to master

156
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:21,270
for something as
base as thievery

157
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:23,937
aren't worthy to
be called ninja!

158
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,570
-All right.

159
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,370
Enough is enough.

160
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:28,637
I tried to cut a
fellow shinobi a break,

161
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,037
and this is the
thanks I get, huh?

162
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,870
Well, now I'm gonna
cleave you in two!

163
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,270
Demon Wind Ninja Blade!

164
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:40,803
Zabato!

165
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:47,670
-Rasengan!

166
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,637
-How dare you lay
a hand on the boss?

167
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,103
-This is the end of
the line for you.

168
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,237
-Really?

169
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,470
MAN: Hold on a minute!

170
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:19,370
-Hm?

171
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:25,837
-I didn't know I was
dealing with a master!

172
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,937
That jutsu just now-- you must
be a man of limitless ability!

173
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,803
Please, do not consider
me impertinent,

174
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,570
but may I ask of you your name?

175
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,170
-For those who do not know
me, prepare to be enlightened!

176
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,803
Before his manliness, no
female stands a chance.

177
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:49,637
Felling his foes, yet
falling for the ladies.

178
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,703
He resides within the
Village Hidden in the Leaves!

179
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:55,470
His name is known
both far and wide!

180
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,137
That's right, soak
it in, gentlemen!

181
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,770
You're gazing on none other than
the legendary master Jiraiya!

182
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:15,037
-Get on y knees, you idiots,
and beg for your lives

183
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,037
before it's too late!

184
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,537
He'll kill us all!

185
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,503
-Forgive us!

186
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:24,937
Have mercy, Master Jiraiya.

187
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,003
If we'd known you were one
of the legendary Sanning

188
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:30,637
of the Leaf Village, we would
never have been so rude.

189
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,070
Have me Please have
mercy on us all!

190
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:36,137
-Well, well.

191
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,037
My reputation precedes
me wherever I go.

192
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,403
Don't worry, it's fine.

193
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:42,803
Now, what's the story?

194
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,137
Is it true you have information
about the Hidden Sound Village

195
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,937
you can give me?

196
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,037
-Yes.

197
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,337
We of the Fuma were
one of the many ninja

198
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,770
clans that reside here in
the Land of Rice Paddes.

199
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:55,837
We all have our own
separate interests,

200
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,637
but the ninja of this land
have always existed in harmony.

201
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,270
Ths is, of course,
until he showed up.

202
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:07,103
-Who is it you speak of?

203
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:09,603
-I hesitate to even
speak his name aloud,

204
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:13,703
but it's Orochimaru, sir!

205
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:34,643
-It's OK.

206
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,276
You're safe now.

207
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:40,243
If that wound gets infected with
tetanus, that'll be it for you.

208
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:42,243
Fortunately, I have
some medicine with me.

209
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,743
Here, let m treat you.

210
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:45,743
-It's OK.

211
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,309
I don't think they're
coming after us.

212
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:49,543
Now that we're safe, let's
have a look at that wound.

213
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,043
Hm?

214
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:56,543
Hm?

215
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,943
-Naruto, I need to concentrate.

216
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:03,076
Go wait outside.

217
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:03,909
-Huh?

218
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:04,743
What?

219
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:05,243
Wah!

220
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:12,143
Well, that's nice.

221
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,609
What'd she do that for?

222
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,543
Fine, then.

223
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:18,943
Fine, be that way.

224
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:26,776
Hm.

225
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,543
SAKURA: No peeking!

226
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,309
[scream]

227
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,376
-Don't worry.

228
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,176
I know.

229
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,176
Let's see that injury.

230
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,709
-Big meanie.

231
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,076
She didn't even
give me a warning.

232
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:06,576
Huh?

233
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:10,876
Whoa.

234
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,776
Cool.

235
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:13,743
SAKURA: Naruto!

236
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,176
You can come in!

237
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:15,676
-Ah!

238
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:25,909
Why is there a
pretty girl in here?

239
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:30,109
I-- uh-- Sakura--
I don't get it.

240
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,876
Who is this girl?

241
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:31,876
-You dope.

242
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:34,609
This is the ninja
from a moment ago.

243
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,509
-Huh?

244
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,009
Huh?

245
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:47,143
Come to think of
it-- What'd I do?

246
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:54,043
-My name is Sasame Fuma.

247
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,843
-So what gives, Sasame?

248
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,709
What were those three
guys chasing you for?

249
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:07,376
-It's OK.

250
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,376
You can talk to us.

251
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,243
Maybe we can do
something to help you.

252
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:21,309
-Those three men are responsible
for guarding over Orochimaru.

253
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,143
They're Sound ninja.

254
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:26,476
-I thought you were in league
with them the other day.

255
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,843
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:29,676
-That doesn't matter!

257
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,476
What else do you know?

258
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,343
-Orochimaru is the whole
reason we've come here.

259
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:38,076
Is there anything
else you can tell us?

260
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:42,576
-Well, all of this began
when the feudal lord

261
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,676
of the Land of
Rice Paddies tried

262
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,876
to expand his sway over
the neighboring countries.

263
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:52,909
The Land of Rice Paddies
is a small territory.

264
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:56,309
We haven't all
that many shinobi.

265
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:58,409
It was a foolhardy attack.

266
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:01,576
Our defeat was clear
from the outset.

267
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,343
And the shinobi
clans of this country

268
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:06,043
who participated
all fell into ruin.

269
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:13,176
We of Fuma were no exception.

270
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,576
I'm told that of
the survivors, some

271
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,576
decided to abandon
this land, while others

272
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,943
have stooped to common thievery.

273
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:24,409
Even so, many of us have
struggled on in the shadows,

274
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,909
praying for the day our
clan could be restored.

275
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,709
It was then that an emissary
from the Hidden Sound village

276
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:34,943
appeared, offering a promise
of the first full scale shinobi

277
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:35,976
village in this land.

278
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,809
The man from the Sound
village told us--

279
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:46,137
-My master, Lord Orochimaru,
is collecting jutsu,

280
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,770
and is interested in
those of your clan.

281
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,704
If you are willing to serve
and display enough merit,

282
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,537
you may be given the chance to
serve under the feudal lord.

283
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,637
SASAME: My cousin
Arashi was seen

284
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,870
as our clan's best
hope for revival.

285
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:06,304
He was chosen as
our representative

286
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:09,904
and set out for the Hidden
Sound with their emissary.

287
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:10,404
But--

288
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,570
-And then?

289
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:22,237
-We just kept waiting for some
sort of message to come from

290
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,404
Arashi, but there's--

291
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:26,470
-There's still no
word from him, right?

292
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,370
-That snake.

293
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:34,470
Orochimaru pulled him
into his twisted web!

294
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:35,104
SAKURA: Naruto.

295
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,104
-Oh!

296
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,270
But, uh, you know,
there's no need to panic!

297
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:44,137
I mean, your cousin
could be perfectly safe!

298
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,570
We don't know one way or
the other, and uh-- Uh.

299
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:48,937
-Dumb ass.

300
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,070
SASAME: I'm going
to save Arashi.

301
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,804
I have to!

302
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:56,870
I don't have any real
strength, and I'm small.

303
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,937
No matter how hard
I tried, I was

304
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,770
nothing but a burden
during training.

305
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,870
But no matter how
many times I faltered,

306
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:06,504
Arashi was always
there to save me.

307
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:09,437
Everyone from my village
has already given up,

308
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,570
so I'm gonna find the
Hidden Sound on my own.

309
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:13,737
-Oh.

310
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,637
And that's why the Sound
ninja were after you.

311
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,970
-Now it's my turn
to save Arashi,

312
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:22,070
just as he would do for me!

313
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,870
-Sasame.

314
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,804
-I want-- I want to be
there for Arashi now.

315
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,370
-Naruto.

316
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:33,370
-Oh yeah.

317
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,104
I'm with you.

318
00:18:35,137 --> 00:18:36,837
We have to go to the
Sound village anyway,

319
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,204
to take back Sasuke.

320
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:42,370
This just means we
have one more person

321
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:43,904
to bring back with us now.

322
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:50,037
Don't you worry, Sasame.

323
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,504
I'm gonna get your cousin
back, no matter what!

324
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,704
-Oh, a Spider.

325
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,404
What is this?

326
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,937
Naruto!

327
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,104
-What the heck is going on here?

328
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:22,570
JIGUMO: Ninja Art, Wind Spiders.

329
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:27,037
My darling children have spun
threads of the purest silver

330
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,037
and led me right to you.

331
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,504
All three of you together
shall carry our secret

332
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:39,070
into the depths of Hell!

333
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:46,037
-He's using a
ventriloquism jutsu,

334
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,604
scattering his voice
in different directions

335
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,004
to mask their
number and location.

336
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:51,904
-Yeah, I'm on it.

337
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,204
You just take care
of her, Sakura!

338
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,937
Time for Multi
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

339
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,770
OK!

340
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,204
It doesn't matter
where you're hiding!

341
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,670
Bring it on!

342
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:17,704
-There are a lot of them, but
he's just using a clone jutsu.

343
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:18,470
No.

344
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,504
Look closely, Jigumo.

345
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,904
The threads are getting tangled.

346
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,070
-They're are tangible?

347
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:25,837
How could that even be?

348
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,137
Are they shadow clones?

349
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,670
-If so-- Kagero.

350
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,004
-Understood

351
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:36,437
[shouting]

352
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,870
KAGERO: Born to be born.

353
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,004
Breathing but to live.

354
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:44,404
One sunrise and one sunset.

355
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:48,704
Kagero's life, like a
mayfly, lasts a single day.

356
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:53,437
But pitying one so ephemeral
is, in itself, pitiable.

357
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,537
Know that I am at my greatest
when lying in the deep and dark

358
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,737
of the earth.

359
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,070
Ninja Art, Antlion Jutsu!

360
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:32,518
[theme music]

361
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:03,252
NARUTO: Man.

362
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,785
These guys are a real
pain in the you-know-what.

363
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,852
But I'm not gonna be done
in as easy as all that!

364
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:12,552
I still have to go kick
that Orochimaru jerk's butt,

365
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:15,185
and bring back Sasuke,
and Sasame's cousin!

366
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:18,118
I don't care if you
guys are power houses.

367
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,318
I'll wipe the floor
with the lot of you!

368
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:24,918
So bring it, from
anywhere you want!

369
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:30,452
Next time, Hear a Betrayal,
and a Fleeting Plea!
