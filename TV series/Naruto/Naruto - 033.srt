[music playing]

2
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,950
-What is this?

3
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:59,518
Where am I?

4
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:10,266
Who's this?

5
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:18,677
It's me, a long time ago.

6
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,445
Father and Mother
shouldn't have died.

7
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,515
It didn't have to happen.

8
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,829
They're all dead because
I wasn't strong enough

9
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,730
to save them.

10
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,303
My whole plan has
been destroyed.

11
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:55,624
-Battle formation Ino-Shika-Cho.

12
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,073
-Ino.

13
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,309
But why?

14
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,679
-I'm tired of you showing
off in front of Sasuke

15
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:14,781
and trying to get
all of the credit.

16
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,184
-These Leaf Village
worms will be

17
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:19,554
sorry they squirmed
their way into something

18
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:22,825
that doesn't concern them.

19
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:23,559
-Are you two crazy?

20
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,027
What are we doing here?

21
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,964
These guys are bad news, man.

22
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:27,965
-Don't look at me.

23
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,133
It was Ino's idea.

24
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,769
But what are we supposed to do?

25
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:34,907
Just sit back and let a
girl do all the fighting?

26
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,110
-Sorry for dragging
you both into this.

27
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,413
But we are a three-man
squad, right?

28
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,783
All for one and one for all.

29
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,584
-Yeah.

30
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,152
What's meant to happen will.

31
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:45,387
-This ain't teamwork.

32
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,123
I call this suicide.

33
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:48,357
Let me out of here!

34
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,059
Please, let me go!

35
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,396
-You're getting on my nerves.

36
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:58,137
-Better a live sheep than
a dead lion, right fatso?

37
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,574
-Did I just hear that right?

38
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,078
What did that guy just say?

39
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,280
-Uh oh.

40
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,650
He just pushed Chogi's
button big time.

41
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,186
-You want to try
saying that again?

42
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,058
-I said you're smart to get
up while you still can, fatty.

43
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,137
-Who are you calling fat?

44
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,172
I'm just a little chubby, OK?

45
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:31,546
[inaudible]

46
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,318
-Huh?

47
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,020
-That does it.

48
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:39,489
Now this is personal.

49
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:43,361
It's a fight to the death
between Leaf and Sound.

50
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:44,328
-Excellent.

51
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:46,298
He's totally lost it.

52
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,266
-Good job.

53
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,301
Thanks a lot.

54
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,170
Now we've got to live with him.

55
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,071
-Don't worry.

56
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:52,906
It won't be for long.

57
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,410
We've gotta get rid
of these clowns.

58
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:58,914
Sasuke is the target.

59
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:00,316
-Oh, Sasuke.

60
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,287
-Sakura.

61
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,889
Your teammates are down.

62
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,223
Look after them.

63
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,298
OK, Team Ino.

64
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:14,234
Let's show them who's boss.

65
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,436
-Got it.

66
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:17,438
-Formation Ino.

67
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,106
-Shika.

68
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,942
-Cho.

69
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:21,676
-OK.

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,212
Take it away, Chogi.

71
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,547
-My pleasure.

72
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,750
Expansion Jutsu!

73
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,885
Followed by leaf style Taijutsu!

74
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:39,065
Human boulder Jutsu!

75
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,834
-You've got to be kidding.

76
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:44,439
Maybe I'm supposed to
laugh myself to death.

77
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,041
Slicing sound wave!

78
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,371
It shook the airstream!

79
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:12,207
This thing is
spinning way too fast.

80
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,377
My sound wave can't control it.

81
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,281
And if I try going
supersonic on it,

82
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,751
it's liable to rip my arms off.

83
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:21,628
-Zaku!

84
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,128
-Oh, no you don't, mummy man.

85
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,563
Time to put you under wraps.

86
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,634
Ninja Heart Shadow
Possession Jutsu!

87
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:38,274
-What's happening?

88
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,615
-Just me and my shadow.

89
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:51,658
-What is it?

90
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:53,127
Why are you just
standing there like that?

91
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:02,238
-It's some kind of
paralysis Jutsu.

92
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,875
-Ina, I'll leave
the girl to you.

93
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:05,408
-OK.

94
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,677
You got it.

95
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,980
Just take care of my
body while I'm gone.

96
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,949
-Sure.

97
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:13,185
-Ninja Art Mind Transfer Jutsu!

98
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,369
-Enough of this.

99
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:26,970
Kane!

100
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:31,742
What's wrong with you?

101
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,019
-Party's over, fellas.

102
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:41,288
Take it easy.

103
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:43,357
One false move from either
of you, and your teammate

104
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,592
here gets it in the neck.

105
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,395
You don't want that to happen.

106
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:47,562
So here's what you do.

107
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:50,165
Just drop the scroll
and walk away.

108
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,103
When you're far enough away
that I can't sense your Chakras,

109
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,838
I'll let her go.

110
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,407
-I don't get these guys.

111
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,743
Something's wrong.

112
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:00,045
Hey, Chogi!

113
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:00,679
-Incoming!

114
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,714
-What is it?

115
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,116
What are they up to?

116
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,326
-This is bad.

117
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,764
-I don't feel so good.

118
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:18,335
-I-- I don't
understand you guys.

119
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:21,572
What kind of monster would
attack their own teammate?

120
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:24,376
-I guess monsters like us.

121
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,413
-You see, we don't play
this game by your rules.

122
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,382
It's not the
scrolls we're after,

123
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:32,720
or even passing this test.

124
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,021
-What the?

125
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,533
-Sasuke.

126
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,538
-I hate it when it does that.

127
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:52,645
-So, your paralysis Jutsu has a
pretty limited duration, I see.

128
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,481
-Shadow Possession Jutsu.

129
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,184
Get your Jutsus right.

130
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:57,285
-Whatever.

131
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:59,654
And I see that your
teammate is able to slip

132
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,391
her soul into her opponent.

133
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:04,995
Very clever, but dangerous.

134
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:08,465
Anything that happens to
Kane happens to her, too.

135
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,802
So if, say, Kane were to die--

136
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,872
-What are you going to
do, kill your teammate?

137
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:16,475
-Well, if push comes
to shove, yeah.

138
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:22,617
-Oh, man.

139
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,484
What a drag.

140
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,354
-Yeah, no kidding.

141
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:27,724
-Did you really think
you could beat us?

142
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:28,925
Face it.

143
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,393
You ninja are just
a bunch of hacks.

144
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:33,697
-From a second rate village.

145
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,268
-That's pretty tough talk.

146
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,971
I guess that makes your
village third rate.

147
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:40,840
-I wonder if any
of you amateurs are

148
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,776
ready to take on the real thing.

149
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:43,377
-What?

150
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,784
-It's Lee's team.

151
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:50,353
I wondered when they'd get here.

152
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,225
-Lee!

153
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,227
-You it.

154
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,700
-These Genin keep popping out
of the woods like cockroaches.

155
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:05,104
-It looks to me like somebody
used our teammate as a punching

156
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,139
bag.

157
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,909
No one does that and
gets away with it.

158
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,657
-Those eyes-- he's not
just looking at us,

159
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:23,127
he's seeing through us.

160
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,198
-No more playing around, Tenten.

161
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:26,999
Full power.

162
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:31,371
-What's the matter?

163
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:32,740
Neji?

164
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:34,174
-That Chakra.

165
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,577
-Well, are you going to
stay up there all day,

166
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:40,016
or are you going to come down
here and do something about it?

167
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,185
-Actually, it
looks like it might

168
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:44,087
have been taken out of my hands.

169
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:10,054
-Because I was
weak, everyone died.

170
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,824
I couldn't save them.

171
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,895
If only I'd been stronger.

172
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:18,064
If only I'd had more power.

173
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:27,542
Instead, you stood by
and watched them die.

174
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:31,047
So helpless, like
lambs to the slaughter.

175
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,786
If only you were stronger.

176
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,755
If only you had more power.

177
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:49,304
-Sasuke!

178
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:50,305
You're awake.

179
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,654
-Sasuke.

180
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,656
That's Sasuke?

181
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:20,177
-Sakura.

182
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:45,509
-Sakura, who did this to you?

183
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,082
Who was it?

184
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:54,754
-Those marks, they're
all over his body.

185
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:58,325
-Sasuke, what's happened to you?

186
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:12,711
-Don't worry.

187
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,112
I'm all right.

188
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,082
It's only the power
flowing through me.

189
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,886
In fact, I've never felt better.

190
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,960
He gave me this gift, and he
made me understand what I am.

191
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:28,230
I'm an avenger.

192
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:32,569
To follow my path, I must
have power at any price.

193
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,239
Even if it means being
consumed by evil.

194
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:44,050
-And now I see those
marks on the neck

195
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,753
that the girl spoke of.

196
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:47,655
You were a curse mark.

197
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,660
Who would have
thought he'd survive?

198
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:54,464
More than survive.

199
00:13:54,497 --> 00:14:00,104
-Sakura, tell me, which one of
these people did this to you?

200
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:01,238
-That would be me.

201
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,249
-Ino!

202
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,650
Hurry up and get
back in your body.

203
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,053
You don't want to
get involved in this.

204
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:14,222
You too, Chogi.

205
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,924
Come on, get out there.

206
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:18,294
-I'm coming.

207
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:19,696
-Mind transfer, release.

208
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,967
-Atta girl.

209
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,103
Good to have you back.

210
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:28,007
-Shikamaru, what's
this all about?

211
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,841
What's going on?

212
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:29,742
-How should I know?

213
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,632
-What is this?

214
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,378
-This changes everything.

215
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:03,918
His Chakra is too
big, too powerful.

216
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:06,321
We can't fight that.

217
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,124
-Dosu, what's wrong?

218
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,993
You're not getting
cold feet, are you?

219
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:10,994
-No!

220
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,596
Saku, you don't understand!

221
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,698
-Watch this.

222
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:15,367
I'll take care of the
whole bunch of them

223
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,369
in one fell swoop!

224
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:19,572
Super sonic slicing wave!

225
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,162
What do you know?

226
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:39,664
Blew them all away.

227
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:40,565
-Not quite.

228
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:46,470
-Zaku!

229
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:51,646
Such speed.

230
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,317
He got both his teammates
out of harm's way

231
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,651
in the blink of an eye.

232
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:01,359
-Fire style phoenix
flower Jutsu!

233
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,962
-I don't think so.

234
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,964
Try this!

235
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:08,535
In the flames, Shukien!

236
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,541
-Zaku, get down!

237
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:28,060
-His Chakra, it's
completely different.

238
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:30,128
It's fiercer, darker.

239
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:34,468
Can that really be Sasuke?

240
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:38,539
-You seem to be very proud
of these arms of yours.

241
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:42,911
You must be very
attached to them.

242
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:43,780
-No!

243
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:44,784
What are you doing?

244
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:48,719
-You wanted Sasuke.

245
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:51,522
You want power, don't you, boy?

246
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:17,589
-It looks like you're
the only one left.

247
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:20,226
I hope you make things
more interesting

248
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,461
than your friend did.

249
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:31,473
-No!

250
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:40,051
It's not-- it can't be.

251
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:48,062
Whoever that is,
it's not Sasuke.

252
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,641
No!

253
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:02,413
Stop!

254
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:03,915
Don't do it.

255
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,933
Stop, please.

256
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,528
-The marks have receded.

257
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,099
We're safe for now.

258
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:44,700
-Sasuke.

259
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,043
-You're strong, Sasuke.

260
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,650
Too strong.

261
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,654
We can't hope to defeat
you the way you are now.

262
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:04,725
We'll strike a deal.

263
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,263
I give you this scroll,
and you let us go.

264
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,842
It would seem we
underestimated you.

265
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,579
But at least we found out
what we needed to know.

266
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,151
For the moment, we're even.

267
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:28,089
But if it should happen that
we ever again meet in combat,

268
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,960
I promise you, we
won't run or hide.

269
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,339
-Wait!

270
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,575
Who is this Orochimaru anyway?

271
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,611
What's he done to Sasuke?

272
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,647
And why Sasuke?

273
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,817
-I don't know.

274
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,287
All I know is that we were
told to target Sasuke.

275
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:54,188
And we did.

276
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,498
I don't know why he sent
us to assassinate someone

277
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:05,269
on whom he'd
bestowed such powers.

278
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:09,642
I don't why Sasuke even
survived the curse mark.

279
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,812
There are many
things I don't know.

280
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,530
-Hey, you guys OK?

281
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,132
-Ino, you look after Lee.

282
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,100
We'll check out the kid.

283
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,503
-Right!

284
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:33,873
-That was no normal Chakra.

285
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:37,043
I had no idea the Uchiha
clan were so strong.

286
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,217
-Sakura is in danger.

287
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,451
I'll protect her.

288
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:44,519
Don't worry, Sakura.

289
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:45,287
It's OK.

290
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:46,355
I'll save you.

291
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,656
-Woah.

292
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:48,858
Somebody ought to kick
him and wake him up.

293
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,794
This is embarrassing.

294
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,129
-Can I kick him first?

295
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:59,972
-Just what am I?

296
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,436
-Sasuke.

297
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:23,803
[music playing]

298
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,353
-Hey, what is it, Akamaru?

299
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,722
You want to go for a walk?

300
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,024
You hungry?

301
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:02,395
Well, did you lose
your chew toy?

302
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,430
Oh, I know.

303
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,465
Just use any tree.

304
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:06,701
It's OK.

305
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:08,336
Ow!

306
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,005
What was that for?

307
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:15,042
-Next time, Akamaru trembles,
Gaara's cruel strength.

308
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:18,175
-Hey, has he had all his shots?
