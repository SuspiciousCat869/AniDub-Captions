[theme music]

2
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,642
NARRATOR: Unforgivable
A total lack of respect.

3
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:13,809
-So what happened?

4
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,275
It's like a typhoon hit it.

5
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:17,675
-Yeah.

6
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:18,375
-Run!

7
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,142
Run for your lives!

8
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,609
-Hey, you there.

9
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,375
What's going on?

10
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,175
Tell me, what are
you running from?

11
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,675
-If you're smart,
you'll run too!

12
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,142
There's a monster up there!

13
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:30,809
-A monster?

14
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:32,309
-Now, just calm down.

15
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:33,509
What kind of monster?

16
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,209
What do you mean?

17
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:34,775
-A snake!

18
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:35,875
A huge snake!

19
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:39,642
It crushed the castle
without even trying.

20
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,542
Well, I'm out of here.

21
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:42,109
-Wait!

22
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,475
How big a snake?

23
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,342
Hey, our village was
attacked by one too.

24
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:45,842
Wait!

25
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,775
Don't go.

26
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,809
I know something
about big snakes!

27
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:51,109
-Naruto, come on.

28
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:53,042
This could be the same snake.

29
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,709
I'd like a closer
look at this monster.

30
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:09,042
-You're going to destroy
the Leaf Village?

31
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
-Well, what do you say?

32
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:38,075
-Lady Tsunade!

33
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,075
Don't trust them.

34
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,742
Do not listen to
their sweet words.

35
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:44,009
Think of your
brother and my uncle.

36
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,209
They wouldn't have
wanted any part of this.

37
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:48,109
This isn't what they lived for.

38
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:49,609
It would be a betrayal of them.

39
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,509
A betrayal of yourself.

40
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,575
Have you forgotten
all your dreams?

41
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,375
I know it's not easy.

42
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,842
I know how tempting
it must seem to you.

43
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,242
But wake up, Lady Tsunade!

44
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,209
Open your eyes!

45
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:10,675
-Shut up, Shizune!

46
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,942
-Don't decide now, but
we'll expect your answer

47
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,875
within the week.

48
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,109
Keep in mind, if
your answer is yes,

49
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:40,409
this Jutsu requires
two human sacrifices.

50
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:43,075
It will be your job to
take care of that part.

51
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:47,042
-What are we doing?

52
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,442
I say we kill them
both here and now.

53
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,875
Come on, Lady Tsunade,
what are we waiting for?

54
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,709
Together we can--

55
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:00,142
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Lady Tsunade.

56
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,342
-Huh?

57
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,209
-It's true, I may be a
little weak right now.

58
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:45,675
However, (CHUKLING)
our good friend here

59
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,242
has her own weaknesses
too, doesn't she?

60
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,742
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Of course, he's

61
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,475
one of the Sannin like
Lady Tsunade, so he knows.

62
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,742
-I see you haven't
lost it yet, have you?

63
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,675
Your fear of blood.

64
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,575
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Hemophobia.

65
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:17,709
-Come, it's time we
were going, Kabuto.

66
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:21,042
I look forward to your
decision, Tsunade.

67
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,609
I'm sure it will
be the right one.

68
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:38,309
[anxious breathing]

69
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,509
-Looks like we're too late.

70
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,575
-Did the snake do this too?

71
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,709
-Let's go, Naruto.

72
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,742
-Uh?

73
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,142
-We're not going to
find Tsunade here.

74
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,575
-Not again, I was hoping
you'd forgotten about her.

75
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,109
MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, come on in.

76
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,275
-Hey, you, another
round over here.

77
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,242
-It's late.

78
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:20,075
We should be going,
don't you think?

79
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:20,575
-Ah.

80
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,609
-Lady Tsunade.

81
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,875
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This
is getting ridiculous.

82
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,609
How many places are
going to drag me to?

83
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:37,742
I'm starting to think this
old lady doesn't even exist.

84
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,609
-Hm.

85
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:44,442
Well, in the meantime, we'll
get a bite to eat in here.

86
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:45,242
-Hey!

87
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,075
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,642
It's a tavern!

89
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,342
-Yeah, so what?

90
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,075
-You trying to be
a influence on me?

91
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:52,642
Hello!

92
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:53,975
I'm underage.

93
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,575
-You idiot, nobody is making
you do anything, all right.

94
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:00,342
Just have a snack and stay
out of the grownups way.

95
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,609
-If we're just looking to eat--

96
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:02,875
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Welcome.

97
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,475
-Why don't we just go somewhere
real like a ramen shop.

98
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,042
Why this stinky dump?

99
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:07,409
-When will you learn?

100
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,009
This is just the
sort of place where

101
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,142
you can pick up information.

102
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:19,275
Hm?

103
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,309
-Huh?

104
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,609
-Tsunade!

105
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,109
-Jiraiya?

106
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,575
What the-- why are you here?

107
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:30,009
-Finally, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

108
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,075
Oh, should have known
you'd be in here.

109
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:34,575
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That is Tsunade?

110
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,809
An old lady, right, pervy sage.

111
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,342
I should have known.

112
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,942
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe it.

113
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,909
To have met two of the other
Sannin in the same day.

114
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,542
MALE SPEAKER: Here
you go, enjoy.

115
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,942
-It's like a reunion.

116
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,842
All y'all's faces coming
back at the same time.

117
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:27,809
-You mean Orochimaru.

118
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,375
So what happened?

119
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,075
-Oh, nothing very much.

120
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,675
We said hello, that's about it.

121
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:59,275
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): It
she really a great healer

122
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:04,209
or did me make that part up too?

123
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:07,542
-Well, then, why have
you been looking for me?

124
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:12,709
-I'll cut right to the chase.

125
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:21,375
Tsunade, in it's
wisdom, the village

126
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,709
has come to the decision to
name you as the fifth hokage.

127
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:35,942
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Hey, can we

128
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,175
get some service around here?

129
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:37,842
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): All right.

130
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,342
All right.

131
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,242
Coming!

132
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,242
[coughing]

133
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,835
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Fifth hokage?

134
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:56,702
Where did that come from?

135
00:10:56,735 --> 00:10:58,535
What the heck's going on here?

136
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,802
-You heard about
the third hokage.

137
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,935
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
The third hokage.

138
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,435
So it's true.

139
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:19,002
-It was Orochimaru's
doing, right?

140
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,569
I heard about it.

141
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:23,402
In fact, he told myself.

142
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:26,069
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Orochimaru's doing?

143
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,635
-Hold on a second.

144
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:30,369
You're saying he's the one
who killed the old man?

145
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,735
Who is this Orochimaru guy?

146
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,869
-He's one of the Sannin, like
Tsunade here and yours truly.

147
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,369
-But then why?

148
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,802
The Sannin are all from
the Leaf Village, right?

149
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:42,135
Why'd he do it?

150
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:46,435
-Who's this brat
you've got with you?

151
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:49,269
-(CHUCKLING) This
is Naruto Uzumaki.

152
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:56,269
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): This
kid is the Nine-Tailed?

153
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:58,569
-OK, wait a second!

154
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,135
I haven't finished yet.

155
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,702
There's something about
this I'm not getting.

156
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,369
So this guy, you
know he's the one who

157
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:09,735
murdered the hokage, what
have you done about it?

158
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,235
He's a Sannin and
he's one of you guys.

159
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,635
Why's he still walking around?

160
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:16,135
Why haven't you caught him?

161
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,002
And, oh yeah, what's
the deal about her

162
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,235
being the fifth hokage?

163
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,169
-Naruto, sit down and shut up.

164
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:23,869
-Absolutley not.

165
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:24,535
-Sit down.

166
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:36,869
Hm.

167
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:53,235
[chuckle] I'll
say it once again.

168
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,602
I Leaf Village has
made its decision.

169
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:58,069
They have chosen you
to be the fifth hokage.

170
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:07,469
So what's your answer?

171
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:18,435
Do you accept it, Tsunade?

172
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:28,169
-This time around, I'm going
to grind the Hidden Leaf

173
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:31,969
Village into dust.

174
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:34,802
I'm offering to bring
your dear little brother

175
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:36,602
and your beloved back to life.

176
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:52,469
-Well, I'm waiting.

177
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:53,135
What do you say?

178
00:13:57,802 --> 00:14:00,635
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Lady Tsunade.

179
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:01,969
-Ah.

180
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,169
I don't understand any of this.

181
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:14,869
-Impossible.

182
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:18,635
I decline.

183
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,602
-You know, it's kind of funny.

184
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,802
That rings a bell.

185
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:34,269
I remember you saying those very
words the first and only time

186
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:35,669
I ever asked you out.

187
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:36,735
-Ahh!

188
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,602
Would somebody tell
me what's going on?

189
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,069
What the heck are we doing here?

190
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:43,335
You said we were going to
bring her back to the village

191
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,969
to cure [inaudible]
Kakashi sensei.

192
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,835
You pull this stuff
about making her hokage,

193
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,435
then she goes and refuses it.

194
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,269
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
No, she couldn't really

195
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:58,569
be thinking of accepting
Orochimaru's offer.

196
00:14:58,602 --> 00:14:59,069
-Ah!

197
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,769
-Don't worry, Naruto.

198
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,935
She knows can't refuse.

199
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:08,135
There can be no one else.

200
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:11,969
There was no one who contributed
more to the Leaf's victory

201
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:12,935
in the great war.

202
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:20,369
She combines unrivaled
skills as a warrior

203
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:23,469
with the ability to heal others.

204
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,535
What's more, she is the
granddaughter of the very first

205
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:30,235
hokage, so in heritage
and abilities,

206
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:34,335
she is the clear and only
choice to be the fifth hokage.

207
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:38,802
And once she accepts her
destiny, which she will,

208
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,635
then she'll have to come
back with us to the village

209
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,302
and there heal your friends.

210
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:47,069
You see, it's all been
very carefully thought out

211
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:50,002
by the highest councils
of the village.

212
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,802
No offense, but
it's not something

213
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,335
an underage genin is
expected to understand.

214
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,102
-You're slipping, Jiraiya.

215
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,602
This apprentice isn't at
all like your last one.

216
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:04,135
He's a fool with a big mouth.

217
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:05,469
Funny looking too.

218
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:06,502
-Oh, yeah?

219
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:08,602
-Well, to be fair,
it'd be hard for anyone

220
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,902
to measure up to that standard.

221
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,202
The fourth hokage
showed all the signs

222
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:16,169
of becoming the greatest
ninja in generations,

223
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:18,969
brimming with talent
and natural ability.

224
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,635
Brilliant, popular,
and to top it off,

225
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:23,935
nearly as handsome
as his teacher.

226
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:28,469
-Oh, sure, but that didn't
save him from dying young.

227
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:31,235
Throwing his life away all
for the sake of the village.

228
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:39,102
Money's one thing,
a life's another.

229
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,069
To risk your life
against all the odds,

230
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:46,502
that's a sucker's bet.

231
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,902
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
A sucker's bet?

232
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:56,935
-My grandfather
and his successor,

233
00:16:56,969 --> 00:17:00,935
they were also willing to
die to defend the village.

234
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,669
Well, their both dead all
right, and the village

235
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:05,802
is no safer than it ever was.

236
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:12,635
-Sounds to me, you've
changed Tsunade.

237
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:15,102
I don't know what's happened
to make you like this,

238
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,035
but to say such things out loud?

239
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:22,335
-Don't forget, I'm not
as young as I look.

240
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,502
The years have taught
me a great deal.

241
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,502
Sarutobi sensei too, he
should have known better.

242
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,202
What did he expect trying
to be a hero at his age?

243
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:50,635
Hm.

244
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:03,702
Ha, playing at
hokage, count me out.

245
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:06,569
It's a fool's game.

246
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:08,635
-Let me go.

247
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:09,535
Stop it.

248
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:10,102
Let me--

249
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:10,769
-That's enough.

250
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:11,802
People are looking.

251
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:15,069
[grunting] Man, let me go!

252
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,402
-Lady Tsunade.

253
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:19,302
I'm not going to
let her sit there

254
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:21,135
and make fun of the old man.

255
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:21,969
No way!

256
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,202
I don't care if she is a lady!

257
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,435
I'll knock that cynical
sneer off her face.

258
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,835
-Are you challenging me?

259
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:41,302
You've got guts,
if nothing else.

260
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,135
Let's take this outside, kid.

261
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,335
-No, no.

262
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:52,069
-Ah.

263
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,735
-One of the legendary
Sannin taking

264
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,435
on a snotty nosed gening?

265
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,302
I ought to be ashamed of myself.

266
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,569
Who you calling snotty?

267
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,169
-Oh, stop trying to show off.

268
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:18,635
-You see this, one finger.

269
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,369
It's all I'm going to
need to take you down.

270
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:23,202
-Please, don't.

271
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,635
-Well?

272
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,002
What are you waiting for, kid?

273
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,435
-Don't ever under estimate me!

274
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:49,869
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Lady Tsunade!

275
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,935
-A flick to the forehead?

276
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,169
I'll show her.

277
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:07,969
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Whoa, she's good.

278
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,302
-Hey, kid.

279
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,435
One question before
you pass out.

280
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:18,769
Tell me, what makes you
so touchy about hokage?

281
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:28,435
-It's because unlike
you, that's my goal.

282
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:29,302
Just watch.

283
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:30,635
Some day I'll be hokage.

284
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:39,169
Remember this, to be
hokage, that is my dream.

285
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:44,735
-That boy.

286
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,402
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
She let her guard down.

287
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:58,002
There's no way I can
take her head on.

288
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:00,235
Now's the time to
use that Jutsu.

289
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:00,735
Focus.

290
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,135
-Hm.

291
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:15,102
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): What?

292
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,135
-Wait!

293
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:17,569
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
That Jutsu, it's--

we've sat down together,

296
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,349
hasn't it?

297
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,316
-Not nearly long
enough, if you ask me.

298
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:09,749
-I was just thinking you're even
prettier than you used to be.

-Well, you're not.

I'm still not
interested, you old goat.

301
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:16,882
-Like women my age are
my cup of tea, anyway.

302
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,216
-You say something?

303
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:21,049
-No, just reminiscing
about the old days.

304
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:22,616
The old, old days.
