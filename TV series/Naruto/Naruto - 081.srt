It didn't have to happen.

going to get right

-Nah, not yet.

There's time for

-Right now, I just want to do
whatever I can to help out.

So you'll have to

-Yeah, don't worry about it.

Once I've had my
ramen from Ichiraku

Curse you, Orochimaru.

After the Kazekage was killed,
Orochimaru, or Kabuto, maybe,

assumed his identity.

in all the five great
Shinobi nations.

105
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,392
You did very well, though.

106
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,625
Two of the five are
now out of the way.

107

-Shut your mouth.

108
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,425
I won't be patronized,
do you understand me?

109
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,559
I'll kill you.

-Forgive me.

111
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:31,259
I didn't wish to--
I'll grant you,

112
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:34,559
we didn't bring
down the village.

113

But let us not forget our
other objective, Sasuke.

114
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,192
You've done it.

115
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:45,225
Your leash is around his neck.

116
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,525
-And all that it
cost me were my arms,

117
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,459
and the entirety of my jutsu.

118
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,625
If I'd only gotten
hold of Itachi Uchiha

119
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,559
from the beginning, we
wouldn't be in this mess.

120
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,925
But it's too late now.

121
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,892
That dream has died.

122
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,892
Itachi is stronger than I am.

123
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:15,925
That is why I pulled myself
out of that organization.

-Oh, yes, that's it, that's it.

134
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:04,059
Oh baby, I'm telling you.

135
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,392
You've got to love
the Leaf Village.

136
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:10,659
The girls here are
off the charts.

137
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:15,092
-You're still playing
the buffoon, I see.

138
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,492
-Just doing a little research.

139
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:21,892
So, old man Homura,
and Koharu sensei.

140
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:25,759
What could you two scholarly
advisors want with me?

141
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,792
-Don't waste our time.

142
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:30,125
You know perfectly well
what this is all about.

143
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,225
-Come on, why the
long faces, guys?

144
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,292
From what I hear, talks
with the Sand Village

145
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,992
went off without a hitch.

146
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,159
-The Sand Village
has stated publicly

147
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,859
that Orochimaru was
responsible for all of this.

148
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,759
At any rate, they've offered
their complete surrender

149
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,192
to the Leaf Village.

150
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:59,692
So at the moment, their
betrayal is a moot point.

151
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,925
-For now we have no choice
but to accept their surrender

152
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,025
in order to shore up
our power in the region.

153
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,792
-That's correct.

154
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,792
However, the strength
of the Leaf Village

155
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,492
has just suffered
an enormous blow.

156
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,592
As things now stand,
our top priority

157
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,192
is preparing for the onslaught
we believe will come.

158
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:22,125
-We have no way of knowing when
one of the surrounding nations

159
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,025
might try to make a play.

160
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,259
Therefore, until the village
has regained its strength,

161
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,692
we've decided to gather the
top Shinobi from each squad.

162
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,459
And assemble an emergency
executive committee

163
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:37,159
to handle the situation.

164
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:37,659
But first.

165
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:45,192
We need a strong and
trustworthy leader.

166
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,759
It is more than just Orochimaru.

167
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,859
It is the seed of a
far greater struggle.

168
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,192
-Look, guys.

169
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,759
I don't know why you're going
to the trouble of explaining

170
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,792
all this to me.

171
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,292
But if you'll excuse me,
I've got to get back to work.

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,092
-I think you'll be interested
in what our plans are.

173
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,292
This village needs the
Fifth Hokage immediately.

174
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,525
-And yesterday, at
an emergency meeting

175
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,825
with the Lord of the Land
of Fire, it was decided.

176
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:14,859
We chose you, Jiraiya.

177
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,459
-Oh, I don't know.

178
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,425
It's not really up my alley.

179
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,325
-It has been decided.

180
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:24,492
Besides, if one of the renowned
Sannin is not suited, then

181
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,425
who else is?

182
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,859
-If you're so set on a
Sannin, there is another.

183
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,859
You're forgetting Tsunade.

184
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:41,725
-There's little doubt that
the child has the capability.

185
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,992
But it hardly matters.

186
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,925
No one even knows where she is.

187
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,525
-I'm sure I can dig her up.

188
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,559
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

189
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,159
-But--

190
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,125
-Tsunade's got
the brains for it.

191
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,792
More than a loafer like me does.

192
00:11:58,725 --> 00:11:59,559
What do you say?

193
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:03,592
-Very well, then.

194
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,025
We'll give it some thought.

195
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,325
But we'll send along three
members of the ANBU Black Ops

196
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,225
to accompany you on your search.

197
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:11,359
-You don't have to worry.

198
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,025
I'm not going to
make a run for it.

199
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,359
Besides, your men will
just get in the way.

200
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:21,725
Although, there is
one guy I wouldn't

201
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,492
mind having along for the ride.

202
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:27,159
I've stumbled across a very
interesting little egg.

203
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,613
-What?

204
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,180
This is so weird.

205
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,113
Sorry, kid.

206
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:38,380
No ticket, no ramen.

207
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:39,880
Those are the rules.

208
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:40,513
-No, no, no, no.

209
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:41,213
Wait a minute.

210
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,146
I just had one, I swear.

211
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,713
Where'd it go?

212
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:49,180
Man, don't tell me I gave
Konohamaru my last one.

I want ramen!

-Hey guys.

218
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,580
You two seem to
be getting along.

-Ah.

220

Idiot.

221
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:12,880
Anko just asked me to pick up
some rice dumplings for her.

222
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:15,046
-What are you doing here,
aside from catching up

223
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,646
on your reading?

224
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,580
-I need to buy something
to put on a grave.

225
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,380
Plus I'm meeting somebody here.

226
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm just waiting on Sasuke.

227
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,480
-Heh.

228
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:29,813
It's not like you to
be waiting on somebody.

229
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:30,646
Is it for Obito?

230
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,080
Be

231
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:31,478

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,013
-Yeah, kind of.

-Kakashi.

235
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,446
It's not like you
to show up early.

236
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,613
What gives?

237
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:49,846
-Well, sometimes I do.

I don't have much
of a sweet tooth.

00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:00,713
-Hm.

242
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:01,746
Is that so?

00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,413
-Come on!

244
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,980
This is totally bizarre.

Where the heck did I
put that stupid thing?

What are you doing
in this village?

249

-It's been a long
time, Asuma, Kurenai.

250
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,613
-The fact that
you know our names

251
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:45,713
must mean that you're a Shinobi,
formerly of the this village.

Well then.

Hope we can get
acquainted later.

-Wow Itachi.

It looks like they hate
you as much in this village

We've heard all about you.

You hail from the

show your face in this
village, after what you did,

You don't want to

00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:41,280
-Yeah, what happened there was,
I stuck in behind my headband

333
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:43,480
because I was so freaked
out it was going to fall out

334
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:45,413
of my pants or something
while I was working out

335
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:48,746
earlier this morning.

336
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,280
-Well, it all worked
out in the end.

337
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:53,813
Now go on, eat up, so
you can do your best.

338
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,246
-Huh?

339
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,546
-You've got more training
ahead of you, don't you?

340
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,680
-You bet I do!

341
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:03,813
I'm going to work my butt off!

342
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,980
-That's the spirit.

343
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,846
Here, have some more.

344
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:10,613
That one there is on the house.

345
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,713
Dig in.

346
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:15,213
-Oh man, thanks a bunch.

347
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:16,913
-Hey there, come on in.

348
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:19,580
-I had to see it
with my own eyes.

349
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:23,113
It looks like you do eat nothing
but ramen, huh, short stuff?

350
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,646
-Huh?

351
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,346

353
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,681
-Itachi Uchiha.

354
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,147
He was the head of the
ANBU Black Ops at 13.

355
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:10,847
And single-handedly wiped
out the Uchiha clan.

356
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:13,681
I don't know why he suddenly
appeared out of the blue,

357
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:15,114
but I don't think
we'll be letting

358
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:18,581
him waltz out of here so easily.

359
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,447
Why have you come here?

360
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:24,014
What are you planning?

361
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:29,481
-Next time, eye to eye,
sharingan versus sharingan.
