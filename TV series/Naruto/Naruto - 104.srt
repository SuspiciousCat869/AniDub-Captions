the race is in the bag?

I think he'll come around now.

It's some kind of
antidote or something.

OK.

can't just leave him out here

Look at this.

You see, I've finally
become a ninja too.

-Of course, I know it's about
more than just a headband.

234
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,562
To be a real ninja,
I'll have to train

235
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:05,929
hard and complete
lots of missions.

236
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:08,896
But just you wait, I'll
make chunin super fast.

237
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:12,729
And then I'll be a jonin
just like you, Ibiki.

238

You'll see.

I'll do it in record time.

00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,629
You know how fast I am.

241
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:17,429
Right, brother?

242
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:24,296
-Listen, Idate.

243
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,129
There is something
more important

244
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:29,829
to a ninja than power
or even success.

245

-Something more important?

246
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,029
-And your ignorant
boasting shows me

247
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,196
that you haven't
learned what it is yet.

he's waking up.

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:50,962
So how are you feeling?

-Where is he?

252
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:53,896
What happened to Aoi?

-He's gone.

254
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,229
So you're telling me that's
that character's name?

Do you know each
other from somewhere?

-He was a sensei I knew back
in my Leaf Village days.

-After he betrayed
the Leaf Village,

262
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:17,462
he became a jonin of the
Village Hidden in the Rain.

that all this time.

-Damn.

All that work, all the
training, all for nothing.

-You're giving up kind
of easy, aren't you?

That's not the way for any
Leaf Village ninja to talk.

-You've got the wrong guy.

of the Leaf Village

walked away from it.

failed the first chunin exam.

I didn't know what to do.

Don't take it so hard.

283
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,229
There are other ways
of becoming a chunin

284

besides taking the chunin exams.

And I know a way.

just what I tell you.

the way I used to feel.

IDATE: Look at me.

342
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,729
I'm worthless.

Aoi said it, and he was right.

345
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:17,862
I'd be better off dead.

NARUTO: Stop it!

00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:20,696
You idiot, you just
said it yourself.

348
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,062
You've still got one person
who believes in you, right?

349
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,796
-I know that's how
you feel, Naruto.

350
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,896
You feel lonely,
and it hurts inside.

351
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,596
And I could have been
there for you more.

-Stop it, Naruto.

360
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,762
He's still far too weak to move.

361
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,296
-If he can't run,
then I'll carry him

362
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,896
on my back the whole
way if I have to.

already reached Modoroki.

-No.

Leave them.

on you, and you

373

don't want to keep him waiting.

374
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,529
Pull yourself together!

just ran off, isn't it, boss?

you finally have

00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:53,662
the chance you've been
waiting for your whole life?

381
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,262
To show someone he
was right to depend

382
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,662
on you, to believe in you?

faster boat around.

-I'll do it.

00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,829
But I'll need your help, Naruto.

-All right, then.

Let's shake a leg.

What is it about
creeps like this?

It's not enough they
try to kill you,

400
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,870
but they gotta talk your ear
off while they're doing it.

It's so annoying.

Anyway, it doesn't
change a thing.

Your Boss Jirocho is waiting
for you at the finish line.

And you don't want to
let him down, right?

a jonin or the devil himself?
