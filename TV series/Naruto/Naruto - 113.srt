-Thanks, Naruto.

00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:14,465
-Shikamaru, that certain pill
we saw Choji take back there,

172
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:17,499
it seemed like some sort
of last-minute trump card.

173
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:19,365
Do you really think he can win?

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,732
-Yeah.

175
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,999
I mean, he said he had some
sort of secret weapon on him.

176
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,565
-Don't worry, Choji's
got a plan up his sleeve.

177
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,932
He brought along with
him the Akimichi clan's

178
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:30,499

person explosive power.

There are three of them,
green, yellow, and red.

181
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,565
The amount of energy that
each of those pills contains

182
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,132
is absolutely massive.

183
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:44,532
-Oh, I got you.

184
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,365
So that's why he was
acting so confident.

185

-Yeah.

186
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,699
But any pill that
works that well always

187

00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:09,899
He's pretty worried
that Choji might not

212
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:11,865
be able to take on
that gargantuan alone,

The chances of Choji defeating
him may be close to zero.

where each of us ends
up fighting alone.

we're not ready to lay down

Choji is good enough
to hold his own,

but he doesn't have
a lot of confidence.

the whole reason
