00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,126
-Naruto, wait!

3
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,863
-I don't wanna wait!

4
00:01:58,897 --> 00:01:59,899
-I'm giving the orders.

5
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,903
You can't just run
off on your own.

6
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:04,308
-So you want me to just
let Sumaru get away?

7
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,679
-You know, Sumaru did have
a strange look in his eye,

8
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:07,982
back there.

9
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:11,723
-It's pretty obvious he went
to get his revenge on Akahoshi.

10
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,727
-If he raises a hand
against the village chief,

11
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,866
not only will he be
ostracized from his people,

12
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:17,636
but he will probably
lose the fight.

13
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,644
Poquito, wait!

14
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:54,500
-Mother!

15
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,365
Not now.

16
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:03,367
You're finally together.

17
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:10,916
Mother, don't go.

18
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:32,796
-Hey!

19
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,933
What's the big idea?

20
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,001
-Shh!

21
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,772
You can't run off
when you feel like it.

22
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:39,177
-But something really
weird is going on in there!

23
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,646
-He's right.

24
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,685
That many ninja means something
pretty serious is happening.

25
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,791
-It looks like they've mobilized
all the Star Villages' ninja.

26
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,828
-That's why we're going
to hang back and observe,

27
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:48,663
before we move in.

28
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,316
-Right.

29
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:06,034
-Sumaru's inside that
training chamber.

30
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:09,275
-And Sumaru's mom-- is she OK?

31
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,210
No way!

32
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:13,684
-[gasp]

33
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,421
-Sumaru.

34
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,060
-So do we really have to go
in there, and finish him off?

35
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,329
-He's only a little kid, sir.

36
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,400
Maybe we should let
the whole thing slide.

37
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,839
-That boy is a danger
to our village.

38
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:26,211
Letting him live is not
a risk we can afford.

39
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:29,183
-B-but sir, Sumaru has always
been the most effective Genning

40
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:30,286
in our entire village!

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,794
-Humph, there are more
pawns at our disposal.

42
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,931
We can just train another one.

43
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:36,766
-Another one?

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,370
-I can't listen to this!

45
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,174
Someone needs to do
something, right now!

46
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:40,809
-No!

47
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:41,276
You'll stay put!

48
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,245
-Let go of me!

49
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,848
I'm gonna kick that
Akahoshi's butt!

50
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,254
-This matter is a
Star Village concern.

51
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,091
We must stand back and
allow the villagers

52
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:49,360
to resolve it themselves.

53
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:51,899
-But there must be something
we can do to help out!

54
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,202
-Exactly!

55
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,239
In fact, I have a good mind
to charge over there and punch

56
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,508
Akahoshi's lights out, myself!

57
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,145
-What the heck are you saying?

58
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:00,250
You're starting to
sound just like Naruto!

59
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,886
-Are you telling me we're
gonna sit on our butts,

60
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,356
and let them tear
the guy to pieces?

61
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:04,726
-I am.

62
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,897
Unless the village orders
us to attack Akahoshi,

63
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,734
there is nothing that we can do.

64
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,975
I'm sorry, Naruto, but
our hands are tied.

65
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:12,910
-Archers!

66
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:13,478
Take aim!

67
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,986
[gasps]

68
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:22,864
-Fire!

69
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:29,312
-For my entire life, I
resented you, mother,

70
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,316
for leaving me all
alone as a child.

71
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,903
But now, I understand why.

72
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:42,874
I know now what made
you stay away from me

73
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:46,548
all those years-- Akahoshi!

74
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,319
I will not forgive him!

75
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:53,797
-Sumaru

00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,247
-Heh, pretty pathetic
way to go, huh?

79
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:20,120
(LAUGHING) What are
you talking about?

80
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:23,494
A young boy and his mother
buried side by side?

81
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,899
There's not a happier
ending than that!

82
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,222
-That chakra's incredible!

83
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,515
-Stop!

84
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:49,617
-But this jerk's an enemy!

85
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,220
He attacked me out of the blue!

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,866
-Huh?

87
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,400
-Ah, you're a Leaf Ninja.

88
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,343
Don't try to act nice with me.

89
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,882
Foreigners are all the same.

90
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,586
They're all trying
to get to our star.

91
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,523
They think if they
get its power,

92
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,929
they can rise above the
other hidden villages.

93
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,399
-So does that mean
that chakra of yours

94
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,873
is fueled by the power
of the Star, too?

95
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,877
I mean, if someone
else had the Star,

96
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:20,216
wouldn't they have the
same chakra as you do?

97
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,518
-No!

98
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,522
The more power you draw from
it, the more hard work and skill

99
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,625
you need to control it!

100
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:26,061
-Yeah, but--

101
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,132
-And that's what I'm gonna
do-- nothing but hard work!

102
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,337
I will become the Hoshikage!

103
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,205
-Great!

104
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,976
I can't wait to work with ya!

105
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,144
-Huh?

106
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:38,254
-'Cause I'm gonna become
Hokage of my village, too!

107
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,425
-You know, you're kinda weird.

108
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,026
-You think?

109
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,569
Take a look at that red one.

110
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,574
Pretty, isn't it?

111
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:51,448
-Natsuhiboshi-- never alone, the
star on high watches over me.

112
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,559
-How can we do nothing
and just let this happen?

113
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:05,980
-Sumaru!

114
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:17,849
Sumaru?

115
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,453
-Listen to me!

116
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,390
If you continue with
the Star training

117
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:30,198
you're all going to die!

118
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,605
The person who stole the Village
Star-- it was Sumaru's mother!

119
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,242
But the only reason
she did it, was

120
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:38,215
because she knew was the only
way to protect you from it!

121
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,718
-Lord Akahoshi?

122
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,190
-Is it really true that the
Star training will kill us?

123
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:50,274
-Don't tell me you all
honestly believe this nonsense!

124
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,013
The only people who cannot
withstand this training are

125
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,683
the ones who don't love
this village enough!

126
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,030
Those with enough
loyalty to the village

127
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,634
will become true shinobi.

128
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,139
And one day, our humble
land will finally

129
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,678
surpass those of the five
great hidden villages!

130
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,116
-Either Hokuto or
Lord Akahoshi--

131
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,121
I don't know which one
--is telling us the truth.

132
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,345
-Misura!

133
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:24,146
-What's he doing?

134
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,286
He's in no condition to--

135
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:28,088
-Everyone!

136
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,290
Please, wait!

137
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,535
Listen to me.

138
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,740
There's something that all
of you here need to see.

139
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,283
-Oh, Misura.

140
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,365
-Wh-- what is all that?

141
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,302
-What happened to him?

142
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:53,241
-Is that an effect
of the Star training?

143
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,079
-That's horrifying!

144
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:57,752
-Lord Akahoshi, you
know that my heart

145
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:01,393
is filled with pride
for the Star Village.

146
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,797
The incredible pain I was in?

147
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,771
I endured it for
the Star training.

148
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:07,773
How?

149
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,443
How can you say I
failed, because I

150
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,712
don't love this village enough?

151
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:14,320
-Misura!

152
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,191
-There's no way he's lying.

153
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,696
An innocent child whose body
has been through all that?

154
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:21,401
-This must be the reason the
third Hoshikage prohibited

155
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:24,108
the Star training from
continuing for so long.

156
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,112
He was worried that
this might happen.

157
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,183
-Maybe we've been
wrong this whole time.

158
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,521
We got so carried away trying
to make this village great,

159
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:33,361
that we were led
down the wrong path.

160
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,098
-You weak little loser!

161
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,737
Your lies will cause the
downfall of this village!

162
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,451
-No, Akahoshi, don't do it!

163
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,887
-Those kids aren't traders, sir!

164
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:47,157
-For goodness sake!

165
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,459
They're just children
from our village!

166
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:55,574
-We won't let this happen!

167
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,512
-You dare betray our village?

168
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:01,220
-Lord Akahoshi, I'm sorry,
but I won't follow you

169
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,759
blindly any longer!

170
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:04,761
-Me too!

171
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,665
-And me.

172
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,701
-Me too!

173
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,669
-I'm with them!

174
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,684
-They have turned their
backs on their own people!

175
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,653
They have betrayed us.

176
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:17,755
Execute them all!

177
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,359
-Lord Akahoshi,
have you gone mad?

178
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,364
-You would have us wipe
out all of the children?

179
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,265
That's horrific!

180
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,468
The village would
have no future!

181
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,803
-Sir, please.

182
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,808
I think you've
taken this too far.

183
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,612
-Perhaps, you should
listen to your people,

184
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,881
and back down for the moment.

185
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,251
-Keep your mouth shut!

186
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,790
You have a lot of nerve
playing the innocent!

187
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,662
You have just as much blood
on your hands, as I do!

188
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,299
-Stop, sir, don't!

189
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,668
Don't you say another word!

190
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,940
-Akahoshi, whose
blood do you mean?

191
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,279
-We should take
pride in our Star!

192
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,417
It sets us apart
from all others.

193
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,922
I couldn't stand by and
allow some foolish leader

194
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:52,363
to prevent our village from
ever using our strongest weapon!

195
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:53,732
-You mean--!

196
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,371
So you killed the
third Hoshikage?

197
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:57,641
-Of course!

198
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:01,682
That explains the mysterious
circumstances around his death!

199
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:04,689
-What do you have to say
about this accusation?

200
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,760
-Answer the charges, and
then accept your fate!

201
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,936
-Yes, it was the
three of us, who

202
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,475
assassinated the
third Hoshikage!

203
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,610
We had to do it!

204
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,647
It was the only way we
could save the village!

205
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:17,717
-You've gone mad!

206
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,654
-You're the ones
who betrayed us!

207
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:20,957
-Traitors!

208
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,229
-Wait, we can explain all this!

209
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:23,864
-It was his idea.

210
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:25,601
We just went along with it.

211
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:26,769
-Shut up, you idiot!

212
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,273
Don't acknowledge anything!

213
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:31,312
-Lord Akahoshi, we can
no longer recognize you

214
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:32,548
as village leader.

215
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:35,020
Our allegiance is not
with you criminals, now.

216
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,628
The heart of this village
is inside those children.

217
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:39,998
-Everyone, listen!

218
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,737
For the honor of the great
Star Village, let us rise up

219
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,674
and stand together
with the children!

220
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:45,276
-Yeah!

221
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:53,626
-Please accept our apologies.

222
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,365
We were completely taken
in by Akahoshi's fast talk

223
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,635
and deceptive ways.

224
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:01,009
-From this point on, we pledge
that we'll fight with you.

225
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,813
[cheering]

226
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,684
Lord Akahoshi, let's give up.

227
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,519
-It's over, sir.

228
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,054
We're finished.

229
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:06,989
-Shut up!

230
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,391
I say when we're finished!

231
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,152
-Ah!

232
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:14,805
Ah!

233
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:17,745
-Misura!

234
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:21,620
-Poquito, keep on
fighting for me.

235
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,525
-Don't go!

236
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,562
-Akahoshi!

237
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:29,436
You can't do as you
please any longer!

238
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,808
-You really think
you can stop me?

239
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:33,812
-Have you gone
completely insane?

240
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,816
-Akahoshi, you've already lost!

241
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,024
Accept your fate like a man!

242
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:42,531
-Oh, is that so?

243
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,705
How can I lose, when
I possess the Star?

244
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,577
-The Star?

245
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,985
-With the Star's power, I shall
become the fourth Hoshikage!

-Such power!

251
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,576
No amount of training
could ever produce

252
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,215
this kind of immense power!

253
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,854
I should've done this from
the start-- made my body

254
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,224
one with the Star!

Aah!

-Byakugan!

261
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,643
All of the chakra
from the Star--

262
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,914
it's being poured into
his chakra network,

263
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,952
and causing an overload!

264
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:11,553
-What?

265
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:15,039

our orders are!

I'm gonna go pound

I won't be responsible.

just tell them I

-I know that voice.

301
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:38,133
That sounds exactly
like Sumaru's mom.

It can't be!

She's protecting Sumaru

why are you so red?

Yet, you destroyed the very
thing we were hired to protect!

329
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,243
Not only did you completely
fail the mission,

330
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,083
but the damages we'd have
to pay would be huge!

331
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:36,685
-Aw, come on, grandma!

332
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:39,626
There was no other way, but
to smash that star thing!

333
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,730
-I was the mission
leader, so it's my fault

334
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,700
for not being able to stop him.

335
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,170
-I am responsible, as well.

336
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:47,041
-And you should punish
me for this, too.

337
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:50,015
-Nah, I think we can
let this one slide.

338
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,617
-Huh?

339
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,922
LADY TSUNADE: So far, we've
received no formal complaints

340
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,660
from the Star Village
over the loss.

341
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,996
[sighs]

342
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,869
-In fact, since the culprit who
was behind the whole nefarious

343
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,140
plot turned out to be
the deputy Hoshikage,

344
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,211
and our client--
well, the mission

345
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,982
was canceled altogether.

346
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,854
-Speaking of which, what
happened to that jerk, anyway?

347
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,727
-Apparently, Akahoshi
and his 2 accomplices,

348
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,867
Yotaka and Shiso are being
held in the Star Village, where

349
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,340
they face severe punishment.

350
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,809
-That's good news!

351
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,049
I guess that means the star village
will become peaceful again!

352
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,288
[knock on door]

353
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:26,125
-What is it?

354
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,194
-Excuse me, Lady Tsunade.

355
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,131
We've completed the
examination of the genin

356
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:30,066
from the Star Village.

357
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,168
-And--

358
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,905
-With the proper
course of treatment,

359
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,144
they should all make
a full recovery.

360
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,681
-And Misura?

361
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:38,918
-Yes, he should be
healthy again in no time.

362
00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:40,322
-All right!

363
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,858
So where is everyone?

364
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:44,196
-They've all been checked out,
and are on their way back home.

365
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,635
-Woo hoo, Naruto, get back here!

366
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,641
This lecture isn't over!

367
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:51,044
-(CHUCKLING) Never
changes, does he?

368
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,160
-Hey!

369
00:20:58,193 --> 00:20:59,028
Guys!

370
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,665
It's great to see ya, Misura.

371
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,335
Looks like you're
doing better, huh?

372
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,671
-Yeah.

373
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,076
-I'm still not gonna
lose to you, you know.

374
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,179
-What's that mean?

375
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,784
-It means I will become
Hoshikage before you.

376
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,056
Even with the power of
our Star taken from us,

377
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:14,127
I will turn my village
into the strongest

378
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,666
of the mighty hidden
ninja villages.

379
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,334
-Oh yeah?

380
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,971
There's no way I'll lose!

381
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:21,375
I'll become Hokage
way before you!

382
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,110
-Shut up!

383
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:23,146
I'm gonna be first!

384
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,151
-I'll be first, and
that's a promise!

385
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:33,926

SHIZUNE: Kiba Inuzuka
has escaped with Akamaru!

387
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:05,120
NARUTO: No way!

388
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:05,889
Kiba?

389
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:07,159
-Fine.

390
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:09,163
Assemble a special pursuit team
for the worst case scenario.

391
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:10,332
SHIZUNE: Yes, ma'am.

392
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:11,200
-Hey!

393
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:12,237
Hold on, isn't that kinda harsh?

394
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,672
LADY TSUNADE: We have no choice.

395
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,176
Public safety must
take precedence!

396
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:17,347
NARUTO: But Akamaru
is Kiba's partner!

397
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,817
LADY TSUNADE: I'm aware of that!

398
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,652
NARUTO: Then you can't--

399
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:20,787
LADY TSUNADE: Quiet, Naruto!

400
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,028
I have an obligation to
protect this village.

401
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,038
NARUTO: Next time!

402
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,206
Kiba's Long Day.
