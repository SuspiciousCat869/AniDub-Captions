[theme music]

3
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:47,960
-Now, let the 10th round begin.

4
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:49,896
-You can do it!

5
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,596
-Fatso!

6
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,700
CHOJI: [grumbling] OK!

7
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:56,069
I'm going to finish this match.

8
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:57,838
It's only going to
take about two seconds,

9
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,108
and then I'm coming
after you, Ino!

10
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,143
-Fine, fatso.

11
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:04,579
If you want this
match to end quickly,

12
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,113
I'll just win it quickly.

13
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:09,184
--[grumble] You're
going to go down hard,

14
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,652
you mummified weirdo.

15
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:12,187
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): I
know his techniques

16
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,923
all too well from my
last battle with him.

17
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:17,125
Those holes in his arm
emit a pulsing sound.

18
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,896
But if I can't hear it,
then he can't hurt me.

19
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:21,730
-Ha!

20
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:24,768
Ninja arts-- Expansion Jutsu!

21
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,571
Now, the Hidden
Leaf Style Taijutsu.

22
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:30,707
[shout]

23
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,576
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): This
will protect my ears

24
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,446
from his attacks and
crush him like a bug.

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,848

27
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:40,451
-Yeah, all right!

28
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,852
Choiji, you can do it!

29
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,421
Crush him good for me.

30
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,023
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
That guy doesn't

31
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,826
need to touch Choji to hit him
with a powerful sonic attack.

32
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,796
But they only work when
Choji's ears are showing.

33
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,800
With his head covered, it's
like Choji's wearing ear plugs.

34
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,404
Those sonic attacks are useless
against that big meatball,

35
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:00,373
especially when it's rolling.

36
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,879
DOSU (VOICEOVER):
[chuckles] He barely

37
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:08,515
has any control over
where he's going.

38
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:11,319
Now to end this-- [grunt]

39
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,253
CHOJI: It's no use.

40
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,554
My ears are covered.

41
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:16,590
-You are so wrong.

42
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:19,493
-[yells]

43
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:23,398
[screams]

44
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,135
[groans]

45
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,971
-See, the human
body is 70% water,

46
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:31,607
and water can
transmit sound waves.

47
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:34,744
In other words, when
it comes to my attacks,

48
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:37,413
your whole body is
basically one big ear.

49
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:43,987
-The winner is Dosu Kinuta.

50
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:49,526
DOSU (VOICEOVER): Lord
Orochimaru-- or rather,

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,330
Orochimaru, now do you see?

52
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:57,502
I'm more than a mere puppet.

53
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:59,437
-Hey, are you all right?

54
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,173
-Meat-- I want to eat some meat.

55
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:04,109
-That's our Choji, always
thinking with his stomach.

56
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:05,210
-Uh-huh.

57
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,779
-Even though he lost,
the least we can do

58
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,615
is take him out for
some barbecue beef.

59
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:12,986
--[coughs] [sigh]
It's finally over.

60
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,488
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER):
At long last,

61
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,090
we can begin the final rounds.

62
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,760
-And with that match, the
third exam preliminaries

63
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,664
are now finished.

64
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:26,501
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): "A Shadow
in Darkness-- Danger Approaches

65
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:34,142
Sasuke."

66
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,545
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): I wonder
what's happened to Naruto.

67
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:37,879
-[laguhs]

68
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:39,515
Come on, let's go sneak outside.

69
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:40,682
Heh.

70
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,917
Iruka-sensei is
kind of distracted,

71
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,886
so this is our big chance.

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,523
-Going somewhere, Konohamaru?

73
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,225
You're not planning on
sneaking out again, are you?

74
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,794
KONOHAMARU: Uh, I need
to use the bathroom!

75
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:53,463
IRUKA: Liar!

76
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:55,365
HAYATE: I commend all
those who have advanced

77
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,769
to the finals for the third
level of the Chunin exams.

78
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,605
Well, there's one person
missing, but still,

79
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,142
congratulations.

80
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:04,976
-Sensei?

81
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,678
-Hm?

82
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:11,383
-I have a question for you.

83
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,752
-About Sasuke?

84
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,020
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:17,122
I don't know much
about that I'm afraid.

86
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:20,259
But I wouldn't worry too much.

87
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,429
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): From here
on, it's up to you, Sasuke.

88
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,136
-Sakura, I have to leave,
so I'm counting on you

89
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,105
to get the details
about the finals.

90
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:32,573
-Huh?

91
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,341
Oh, OK.

92
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:41,048
HOKAGE (VOICEOVER): Here,
including the absent Sasuke,

93
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:45,052
we have five ninja
from the Leaf Village,

94
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:51,627
three from the Sand Village,
and one from the Sound Village.

95
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,896
-And now, I will
begin the explanation

96
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:55,864
of the final rounds.

97
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,468
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Well, it's about time.

98
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:00,236
[bell gong]

99
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,441
[birds chirping]

100
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,910
-The preliminaries are done.

101
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:10,347
They're moving on
to the final rounds.

102
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,916
-While all of
these countries are

103
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,152
busy racing to expand
their military might,

104
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:18,089
the birds are still singing.

105
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:19,824
I believe that this
country of ours

106
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,260
has been at peace for
far, far too long.

107
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,366
-Then let me do it.

108
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,600
-Hmm?

109
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:30,236
I don't know.

110
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,640
How much fun would be to take
out an old man like the Hokage

111
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,608
anyway?

112
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,076
-So that's how it is.

113
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,114
What's the problem?

114
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,850
You're not still having
second thoughts about it,

115
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,885
are you Orochimaru?

116
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,287
From now on, each of
the Hidden Villages

117
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,560
will clash with each other in
a long and violent struggle.

118
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:55,029
Even the Sound Village
won't escape that violence.

119
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,369
And it's your intention
to be the trigger for all

120
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:04,639
that hostility, by using
Sasuke as a bullet.

121
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,241
Isn't that correct?

122
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:09,044
-[chuckles] You guess very well.

123
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,781
So well that it's a
bit creepy, in fact.

124
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:13,549
-You give me too much credit.

125
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,687
I still didn't know about your
plans involving Dosu, Zaku

126
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,254
and Kin.

127
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,457
While gathering
information on Sasuke,

128
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:23,594
I wanted to learn the skills
of those three Sound ninja.

129
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:28,966
So I clumsily confronted
them and let them attack me.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,304
I learned a lot.

131
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:35,173
It seems that you
don't quite trust me,

132
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:39,311
Orochimaru-- at least, not yet.

133
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:42,114
-Was it necessary to tell
you, my right-hand man,

134
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:43,316
about those three ninja?

135
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:45,985
My silence is proof of my trust.

136
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,521
I trusted in you to act
without that knowledge.

137
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:59,233
For that very
reason, I'm planning

138
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:03,137
to leave Sasuke in
your capable hands.

139
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,805
The curse mark that
was give to him

140
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,242
appears to have been
sealed by Kakashi.

141
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:10,378
But in any event, that
is not my concern.

142
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:13,415
While there is still some
darkness left in his heart,

143
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,284
we must act.

144
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:18,554
And that's why I want
you to abduct him.

145
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:22,391
-It's unusual for you to
act so hastily, is it not?

146
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:24,527
-Perhaps, but there's
still a little something

147
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,630
that's troubling me.

148
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,667
-Is it Naruto Uzumaki?

149
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,704
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER): Hmm,
you're quite sharp, aren't you,

150
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:35,205
Kabuto?

151
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:37,475
OROCHIMARU: Sasuke
is driven by revenge.

152
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,477
He's burning to bring
down his older brother

153
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,213
Itachi for what he
did to their family.

154
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:45,817
He won't rest until
he achieves that goal.

155
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,752
And yet, when we
fought each other,

156
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:50,389
even though he knew he
couldn't prevail against me,

157
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:53,658
he came at me without
any fear of death.

158
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:55,728
I didn't think he'd be
the type of person who

159
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:59,098
would be in such a hurry
to die a meaningless dead.

160
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,501

00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:04,771
with that nine-tailed one
has altered Sasuke's heart

162
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,239
and mind.

163
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:09,142
So much so that Naruto now
holds a certain influence

164
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:10,811
over our Sasuke.

165
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:14,749
The think to do is to get Sasuke
away from him immediately.

166
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:19,320
Because then, it will be so
easy to make him mine forever.

167
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:20,262
Mm.

168
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,732
-Very well.

169
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:30,833
-Kabuto, wait.

170
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:36,305
You know if it's your
desire to stop me.

171
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:48,585
I'm afraid your only chance
is to kill Sasuke now.

172
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:51,321
You can't possible
hope to kill me.

173
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,825
Even if you did have the
courage, it's worthless.

174
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,561
You're no stronger than Kakashi.

175
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,408
[laughs] I'm just kidding you.

176
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,578
But you'd better run along now.

177
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,646
Don't forget I'm
trusting you, Kabuto.

178
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,990
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
Hmm, that face.

179
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,494
I wonder what's
going on in his head.

180
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,396
HOKAGE: In the final
rounds, each of you

181
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:31,299
will put your battle
skills on display.

182
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,434
You'll demonstrate
the power and control

183
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,872
that you've achieved in
your respective disciplines.

184
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,841
Accordingly, the
final battles will

185
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,643
commence one month from now.

186
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,580
-Wait, we're not going to
do it right here and now?

187
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:48,451
-This is to provide a suitable
period of preparation.

188
00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:50,286
-What do you mean by that?

189
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,256
-Simply this-- in addition
to announcing the conclusion

190
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,859
of the preliminary matches
to each country's leaders,

191
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:58,995
we must also have some time
to prepare and distribute

192
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,332
the summons for the
final selection.

193
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,367
Not to mention
that you examinees

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,069
are going to need
time to prepare

195
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:07,038
for something that
is this important.

196
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,340
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
This old man

197
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,342
sure likes to beat
around the bush.

198
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,845
-Look, I don't really get
what you're trying to say.

199
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:14,546
What's the point of this?

200
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,850
-I mean that your adversaries
and prepare yourselves,

201
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:19,318
you need time.

202
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:21,420
Even though up to this
point, all the battles

203
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,356
have been real
battles-- as I'm sure

204
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:26,392
you can all attest-- they
were conducted on the premise

205
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,294
that you were fighting
an unknown enemy.

206
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,264
But that's no
longer the case now

207
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:32,332
that you've battled each other.

208
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:34,068
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Yeah, seriously.

209
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,904
I would never have dreamed
that this guy could turn sand

210
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:38,372
in a weapon.

211
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:41,276
-So in order to make the
finals fair and just,

212
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,543
we're giving you this month.

213
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,545
Each of you must
embrace the opportunity

214
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,348
to practice hard and
learn some new tricks.

215
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:50,285
Because by now, everyone
here knows your techniques.

216
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,921
So using your old, tired
tricks is a sure way

217
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,190
to lose in the finals.

218
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:56,025
And remember to get
some rest as well.

219
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:09,472
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This
isn't some vacation.

220
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:11,609
I won't have any time to relax.

221
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:13,977
I've got to train
harder than ever.

222
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:28,093
[beeping]

223
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,296
--[sigh] I suppose brilliance
can sometimes have its

224
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,632
disadvantages.

225
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:35,868
We failed to avoid
Orochimaru's watchful eye,

226
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:39,805
and it's most unfortunate
for both of us.

227
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,009
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): He's so
young, but the seeds of evil

228
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:46,713
have already taken root,
just waiting to be exploited.

229
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,816
He'll be ripe for
Orochimaru's special Ninjitsu.

230
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,326
-Kabuto.

231
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,861
Most interesting.

232
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:03,732
Perhaps Kabuto really is going
to kill Sasuke after all.

233
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,100
[beeping]

234
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,451
-Well, well, Kakashi,
foiling my attack

235
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:24,288
by striking from
my blind spot, huh?

236
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,792
But now, are you
ready to take me on?

237
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:32,497
Next time, you should
station at least 10 guards.

238
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,365
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
The Anbu Black Ops unit

239
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,335
that I assembled was
defeated so easily.

240
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:40,972
-You-- you're not an
ordinary Genin, are you?

241
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:43,409
You caught a whiff of me
and immediately readied

242
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,443
your weapon.

243
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:46,412
Quite impressive.

244
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:49,215
-You overestimate me.

245
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,983
-So what do you
want with Sasuke?

246
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:55,088
Finding you like this, I ought
to haul you in for questioning.

247
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:56,356
-What?

248
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,193
Just you? [laughs] I
wonder if you could.

249
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:01,962
-Are you looking to take me on?

250
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,668
I know who you are.

251
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,505
You're the Leaf Medical
Corps Chief's son.

252
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,841
Your name, what was it?

253
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:13,842
Kabuto Yakushi.

254
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:17,479
What are you?

255
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:21,316
One of Orochimaru's puppets?

256
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,686
-Even if you did
take me into custody,

257
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:27,223
you'd never be able to prove
I have any connection to him.

258
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:30,226
-Just answer my question.

259
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,663
-And if I say no?

260
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,131
-I'm the one asking
the questions.

261
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,767
Now give me some answers.

262
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,635
-Look, you'll have your
answers soon enough,

263
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,437
even if I'm not here.

264
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:43,708
So why don't we skip the
middleman and let me go?

265
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:46,778
-You smart-alecky little brat.

266
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:50,548
I'll teach you to mess
around with grownups.

267
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,250
-Come on, give me a break.

268
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,552
Don't be so arrogant.

269
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:56,622
The cards are clearly
in my favor here.

270
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:24,653
-I should've known.

271
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,688
[gasp]

272
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:00,124
I can't believe
I let him escape.

273
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,626
[beeping]

274
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,197
Impressive.

275
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,707
Just as I suspected,
the Dead Soul Jutsu,

276
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,543
where a ninja temporarily
animates and controls

277
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,881
a dead body, even
transforming its face.

278
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,883
Kabuto even stopped
his own heart

279
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,885
and eliminated all
traces of his scent

280
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,889
in order to escape by
impersonating a murdered Anbu

281
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,724
Black Ops ninja.

282
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:33,395
Being raised as the adopted
son of the chief of the Medical

283
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:36,864
Corps is a powerful
asset of his.

284
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,700
If it turns out
that someone as good

285
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,369
as him is working
for Orochimaru,

286
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:45,040
I've got to work harder.

287
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,043
-Now, with all of
that behind us,

288
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:50,013
I'd like to begin
winding things up.

289
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,048
But before we can
bring this to an end,

290
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,083
first, there is one
more important matter

291
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,486
to take care of for
the final rounds.

292
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,421
-Let's get on with it.

293
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:58,855
I mean, come on!

294
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,557
How long do we have to wait
until we start training?

295
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,927
-In a calm, orderly
fashion, all of you

296
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,763
are going to take one
slip of paper from the box

297
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,565
that Anko is holding.

298
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,100
-Everyone just
stay where you are.

299
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,369
I'll come to you.

300
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:12,303
Just take one.

301
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,480
-Hm?

302
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,381
-Good.

303
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:23,582
Now everyone has one.

304
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,017
Going from left
to right, tell me

305
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,554
the number that's written
on your slip of paper.

306
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,622
-I've got eight.

307
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:31,358
-Number one, of course.

308
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,893
-Seven.

309
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,027
-Five.

310
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:35,228
-Three.

311
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,163
-Nine.

312
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:36,864
-Two.

313
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,098
-Six.

314
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,102
IBIKI: And that means
Sasuke will be number four.

315
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:43,371
HOKAGE: Right.

316
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:44,906
Very good.

317
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,675
Now I'm going to tell you
about how the final selection

318
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,577
tournament is going to work.

319
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,412
-Eh?

320
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,746
-Is that what the
numbers are for?

321
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,248
Drawing lots?

322
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,985
-Ibiki, you may reveal which
ninja have been paired up.

323
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:57,653
-Yes, sir.

324
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:00,222
-[grunts]

325
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,262
DOSU (VOICEOVER): I'll
be waiting forever.

326
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:08,665
TENMARI (VOICEOVER): Is that
all the final rounds are?

327
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,133
A tournament?

328
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,735
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): I
have to fight an extra round?

329
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:15,873
I'll probably be expected
to avenge Choji's loss.

330
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,675
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Man, I'm glad I'm not

331
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:20,512
in the same <i>hat</i>
to draw as Gaara.

332
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,980
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke Uchiha?

333
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,983
Perfect.

334
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,685
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I've got Neji Hyuga?

335
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,487
Right off the bat?

336
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,758
This couldn't be any better.

337
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,394
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke
has to go up against him?

338
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,235
-May I ask you a question?

339
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,470
-You may.

340
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:45,639
-All right, if this
tournament, does

341
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,975
that mean there's only
going to be one winner?

342
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:50,678
I mean, only one of
us is going to be

343
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,813
able to become a Chunin then?

344
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,015
-Actually, it's
quite the contrary.

345
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,585
There are going to be several
judges for the final rounds,

346
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:01,089
including myself, the Shinobi
leaders, and the Kazekage,

347
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,759
the lords from the various
countries that ultimately will

348
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,061
be assigning your
missions to you.

349
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,963
Through this
tournament, these judges

350
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,367
will be able to make a thorough
evaluation of your abilities.

351
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,036
They will then decide
whether any or all of you

352
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,574
possess the qualities
required of a Chunin.

353
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:19,876
Even if someone loses
the first round,

354
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,179
they could still
become a Chunin.

355
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:24,882
-So there's actually a
chance that every one of us

356
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,517
who competes in
the final selection

357
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,219
could become a Chunin.

358
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,520
-Correct.

359
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,322
But conversely, there's also
a chance that none of you

360
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,891
will be chosen.

361
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,560
The advantage in fighting
more rounds in the tournament

362
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:39,063
is in getting more chances to
display your talents in front

363
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:41,333
of the judges who
will decide your fate.

364
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,269
Does that answer your
question, Shikamaru?

365
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:47,006
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): This
is just about the biggest pain

366
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,140
ever.

367
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:50,276
-I thank you all
for your patience.

368
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,278
Now let us adjourn
until next month.

369
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:54,014
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
In the second round,

370
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,149
will it be Sasuke or
that browless freak?

371
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:58,485
He's so strong he
took down Bushy Brow

372
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,120
without breaking a sweat.

373
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:02,456
-Sand Coffin.

374
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,025
ROCK LEE: [screams]

375
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:12,033
-You're one of the ones
I want to fight the most.

376
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,368
-[gasp]

377
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:19,475
[groan] I need to ask
Kakashi-sensei for help.

378
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:23,746
NARUTO: Hey, where's
Sasuke's room?

379
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,049
-Sorry, no visitors allowed.

380
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:26,883
-What?

381
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,718
No visitors? are you kidding me?

382
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,286
-Those are the rules.

383
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,788
-Ah, come on, lady.

384
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,557
-Naruto, this is a hospital.

385
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,524
Keep it down.

386
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,425
-Huh?

387
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,861
Oh, Kakashi-sensei!

388
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:38,495
Boy, am I glad to see you.

389
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,498
I gotta ask you a favor.

390
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,766
-Stop right there.

391
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,334
I already know what
you're going to ask.

392
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,002
So I've been looking
for someone that

393
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,806
can oversee your training
for the final rounds.

394
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,040
-Hold on!

395
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,209
Why can't you train me, sensei?

396
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:53,445
-I have other matters to handle.

397
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:56,515
I don't have time to
deal with you, Naruto.

398
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,285
-[grumbling] Hey!

399
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:00,687
Aha!

400
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,424
You're going to train Sasuke,
aren't you, Kakashi-sensei?

401
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,293
-Now, now, don't complain.

402
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:09,897
Listen, I found you an even
better teacher than me.

403
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,632
-Well, who is it?

404
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:13,233
EBISU: It is I.

405
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,235
-Hm?

406
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,537
You?

407
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,373
You closet pervert!

408
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:20,341
-Such insolence.

409
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:24,593
[theme music]

410
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:55,793
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Believe it.

411
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:57,795
I can't believe this!

412
00:22:57,828 --> 00:23:00,764
I don't care if Ebisu
is an elite tutor.

413
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,300
What can I learn
from some closet

414
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,335
pervert who's weaker than me?

415
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:05,670
I don't have time for this.

416
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:08,306
I have to get stronger
for the final rounds.

417
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:10,875
If this guy's really as
good as he's supposed to be,

418
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:13,345
he's going to have to prove it!

419
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:16,540
Next time, "Ebisu
Returns-- Naruto's

420
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:18,040
Toughest Training Yet!"

421
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:21,973
No matter what, I will
win the next match.
