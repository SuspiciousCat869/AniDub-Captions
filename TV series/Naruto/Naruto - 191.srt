-I depend on no one.

3
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,353
I will do this on my own.

4
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,253
-Hold on.

5
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,154
I'm coming with you.

6
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,726
Like it or not, I made
a promise to Hinata

7
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,728
that I'm going to protect you.

8
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,201
-To Hinata?

9
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,436
-She got pretty badly
injured fighting

10
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,372
that second ninja
who was after you.

11
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,173
-She what?

12
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,376
But I was sure that
you and the rest

13
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,579
have decided that protecting
me wasn't part of your mission.

14
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,981
If that's true, why
are you doing this?

15

-It's just the way we are.

16
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,320
We don't like it when see
somebody getting a raw deal,

17

even if that somebody
is maybe not, well,

18
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,991
the nicest person in the world.

19
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,396
But that's not important.

20
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,097
There's a narrow
canyon up ahead.

21
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,465
And we've got to get through it.

22
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,100
The village is on
the other side.

23
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,403
And hopefully, they
won't follow us there.

-You were so close.

27
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,187
But you'll never reach
that village now.

28

He's floating in air!

-That's right.

32
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,432
And this is just the beginning.

33
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,502
My jutsu is beyond
anything you can imagine.

34
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,440
For example-- heeyah!

-Yeah, I'm all right.

Don't worry.

39
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,218
But what-- what the heck
was that he hit me with?

40
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,555
-You have other things to
worry about now-- like, what's

41
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,324
to become of those friends
of yours I'm holding hostage.

42
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,425
-Your-- what?

43
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,326
-Huh!

44
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,461
-Don't worry.

45
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,330
I'll let your friends live
if you just step aside

46
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,998
and let me have the girl.

47
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,300
-Hinata and Choji?

48
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,040
-Well then, what's
it going to be, kid?

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,710
-Naruto, would you abandon
me, like everybody else?

50
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,978
-You hear that?

51
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,513
What the princess
is really saying

52
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,548
is that you should stay
with her and abandon

53
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,150
your friends to die.

54
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,686
Not a very noble
attitude, perhaps.

55
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,323
But I have to admit, it's
just what I would say.

56
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,391
-Why am I not surprised?

57
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,528
-I have no use for people who
no longer serve a purpose-- be

58
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,030
they friends,
family, or whatever.

59
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,565
In fact, that's
something I should

60
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,134
thank you and your friends for.

00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,469
What do you mean?

63
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,472
-For eliminating those
weaklings, Jiga and Ruiga.

64
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,207
You saved me the
troublesome task

65
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,443
of having to get
rid of them myself.

66
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,744
-You what?

67
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,513
-It wouldn't have been
long before they'd

68
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,082
have started whining,
brother, when are you

69
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,484
going to give us a
share of our spoils?

70
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,722
Hah, three feudal
lords is two too many.

71
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,725
-You'd do that to
your own brothers?

72
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,294
-What does it matter
that they're my brothers?

73
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,997
Like I said, if someone's
of no use to me,

74
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,566
I have no use for them.

75
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,436
Now, stand aside and
let me have the girl.

-A guy who'd betray
his own brothers?

00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,645
What makes you think
someone like that would ever

keep his end of
the bargain anyway?

-It looks like ice.

-Hah, you see I'm able to gather
the water vapor in the air

00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,160
and instantly transform it
into an impervious wall of ice.

-That's it!

He was attacking me with ice.

108
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,431
No wonder it was invisible.

Exactly.

But turning the ice crystal
into a magnifying lens,

134
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,315
I can focus the sun's
rays into a deadly beam.

Once I'm in full control

00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,560
-Think of your friends.

168
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,630
If you ever want to see them
alive again, all you have to do

169
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,167
is walk away and go quietly
back to your own village.

170
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,569
-I swore to defend
her, no matter what!

171
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,971
I gave Hinata my word!

172
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,039
-Really?

173
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,208
So merely to keep a
promise to a friend,

174
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,179
you're going to fight a
battle you can't possibly win?

175
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,180
-Hrrh!

176
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,048
-[laughs]

177
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,717
You're just another
soft-hearted little fool,

178
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,188
like the late lord of
the Land of Greens.

179
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,190
HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
Oh, my father.

180
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,565
-[laughs]

181
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,434
You're just another
soft-hearted little fool,

182
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,070
like the late lord of
the Land of Greens.

183
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,073
HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
Oh, my father.

184
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,075
-There was only one
thing he cared about

185
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,244
as we stole his land from him.

186
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,214
You should have heard him
beg, "Only one thing I

187
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,082
ask, spare my people.

188
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,184
Spare them!"

189
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,587
-I don't care what
happens to me.

190
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,588
But spare my people.

191
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,156
I beg of you.

192
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,391
We're only small,
weak land surrounded

193
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,060
by powerful neighbors.

194
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,330
We can only survive by
being strong and united.

195
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,666
The life of every citizen of the
Land of Greens, young or old,

196
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,667
is precious.

197
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,036
Not a single life can be wasted.

198
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,439
Whatever you do, for
the sake of this land,

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,642
you must be good to my people.

200
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,279
-But sadly for him, they're
not his people anymore.

201
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,680
They are mine.

202
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,616
-That's it!

203
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,551
-Wha--

204
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,752
-Now, I see!

205
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,388
That's why this land has
been at peace all this time.

206
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,557
-What do I care whether
it's been peaceful or not?

207
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,327
To me, it's only a stepping
stone to greater things.

208
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,762
And why don't you
ask his daughter

209
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,732
how peaceful her life has
been the last 10 years?

210
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,733
-[gasps]

211
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,735
-What the heck are
you talking about?

212
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:53,273
-Her father gave
her up as a hostage.

213
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,241
-Our neighbors were too strong.

214
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,144
The pressures they put
on us were too great.

215
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,146
Our land was on the
verge of collapse.

216
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,017
There was rioting,
treachery, corruption.

217
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,486
They demanded a hostage.

218
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,721
And so I made the
dreadful decision

219
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,358
to send them my daughter,
the light of my life.

220
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,094
Is it possible Haruna
could ever forgive me?

221
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,099
Can any father ever
be forgiven who

222
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,601
would sacrifice
his own child, even

223
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,572
if he thought it was
only to save his people?

224
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,074
-I don't know.

225
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,745
You'll have to ask her when next
you see her in the afterlife!

226
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,314
-[gasps]

227
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,617
HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
Father, murdered!

228
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,319
-[laughs]

229
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,753
What a sentimental fool!

230
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,288
-You're wrong!

231
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,591
He was a wise man!

232
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,493
-Naruto.

233
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,628
-Hah!

234
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,431
There are just two kinds
of people in the world--

235
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,101
the ones who use others
and the fools who get used!

236
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,038
As for me, I will gladly
use anyone to get where I

237
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,340
what I want to go.

238
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,674
-No way!

239
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,242
Not this time, mister!

240
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,977
-Oh, no?

241
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,378
Haah!

242
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,751
-Aargh!

243
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,352
Ugh!

244
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,023
He's too strong.

245
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,991
Huh?

246
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:19,392
Ugh!

247
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,734
-Now, die!

248
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,301
-Aah!

249
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,238
[coughs]

250
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:32,638
Ugh.

251
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,245
HARUNA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

252
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,713
-What's wrong, kid?

253
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,616
You don't seem quite as spunky.

254
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,152
-It'll never happen.

255
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,020
You're not the one.

256
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,455
-Huh?

257
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:55,228
-It was Haruna's father who kept
this place safe and peaceful.

258
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,029
-Huh?

259
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:02,034
-There's only one person who
can be lord of this land.

260
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,437
Only one person has the right.

261
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,639
And that's Haruna, no one else!

262
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,211
-No, stop!

263
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,212
-What are you doing?

264
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,148
Get out of here
while you still can!

265
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,315
-It's me you want.

266
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,219
To succeed, you have to
eliminate me, not Naruto.

267
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,220
Forget him.

268
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,456
He has nothing to do with it!

269
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,525
-I see there's a
soft-hearted streak that

270
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,226
runs in your family.

271
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,228
You and your father
will have a great deal

272
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,298
to discuss when you're
reunited in the hereafter.

273
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,634
-Uhm.

274
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,104
-Oh, if looks could kill.

275
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,072
-I've had it with this guy!

276
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,979
-And I have more than
had it with you, kid.

277
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,281
-Don't call me "kid."

278
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,249
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

279
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,485
And I made a promise
to someone-- a promise

280
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,190
to protect the Land of
Greens from jerks like you!

281
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,591
-Naruto!

282
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,192
Uh!

283
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,130
-There, there.

284
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,070
-Hrrh!

285
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,473
-What?

286
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,073
-Rrh!

287
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,014
-Aargh!

288
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,016
-Oh!

289
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,385
-What have you done?

290
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:26,986
Uhh.

291
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,756
Ugh.

292
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,358
It's too late.

293
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,495
You may have beaten
me, but I've left

294
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,230
the Land of Greens devastated.

295
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,500
And without a leader, it will
soon fall to its neighbors.

296
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,168
WOMAN: Sorry, I don't think so.

297
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:42,568
-Huh?

298
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,473
Shizune?

299
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,543
-It's such a drag
cleaning up after you.

300
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,477
-Shikamaru!

301
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,212
But, uh, what are
you doing here?

302
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,448
It's not like I
needed your help.

303
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,983
-Oh, you didn't, huh?

304
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,985
How come you're
looking so beat up?

305
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,585
-What do you mean?

306
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,720
I tripped, that's all.

307
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,721
GIRL: Naruto!

308
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,488
-Huh?

309
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,756
-[laughs]

310
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,192
Hinata, Choji, Yurinojo!

311
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,327
And you guys are all right!

312
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,131
-Yes, thanks to all of your
comrades from the Leaf Village.

313
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,165
-Wait a minute.

314
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,500
I still don't get it.

315
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,702
How come you guys are here?

316
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,205
-We received word that
there might be trouble here.

317
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,408
So Lady Tsunade sent
us to offer assistance.

318
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,410
She's fond of the
Land of Greens.

319
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,713
The lord of this place was
very generous to her once.

320
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,248
-My father?

321
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:33,085
-Unfortunately, by the time
we arrived, your father--

322
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,154
your father was already, uh--

323
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,756
-I understand.

324
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,724
How can I thank you?

325
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:39,992
-So close.

326
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,762
I was finally lord of the land.

327
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,230
-But wait.

328
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,766
Won't the Land of Greens be
attacked by its neighbors now?

329
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,100
-They wouldn't dare.

330

-So, at least,
that's one thing you

334
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,045
won't have to worry
about, Haruna.

I don't blame you for
wanting your revenge.

from way up here.

00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,526
You can be sure
he'll be watching

353
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,497
over the Land of
Greens from now on.

354
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,968
-Well, Lady Haruna, we'd
better be on our way.

-Thank you, Naruto,
Choji, Hinata.

to ask a favor, if I may.

-Of course, what is it?

-I'm not sure I'm ready
to assume my father's

role as protector of this land.

360
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,618
I'd be much more
confident if I had

the help of the Leaf Village.

-Yes.

Will you let Naruto
stay with me?

But I'm afraid I can't.

You see, I'm needed at home.

I've got a lot of
responsibilities, too.

training and making
myself stronger.

And I depend on
them to do the same.

My friends and me--
we need each other.

take you away from them.

All right, I'll do my best.

And one thing that will help me
follow in my father's footsteps

385
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,181
is if you'll promise to always
be my friend, too, Naruto.
