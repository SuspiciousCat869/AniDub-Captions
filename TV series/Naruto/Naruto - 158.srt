2
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,598
NARUTO: "Follow My Lead!

3
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:59,165
The Great Survival Challenge!"

4
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:01,831
-Well, I just hope
I don't mess it up.

5
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:02,831
-I can't wait!

6
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:04,731
What about you, Konohamaru?

7
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07,498
--[chuckling] This
is gonna be fun.

8
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:08,198
Ha!

9
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:09,198
NARUTO: No way!

10
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:10,165
No way!

11
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,765
You gotta be kidding!

12
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,498
-Hmm.

13
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:18,131
--[growling] I wanna be
sent on a real mission,

14
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,298
not get sent with babysitting.

15
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:21,798
That's not what I signed up for!

16
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:22,898
No way, forget it!

17
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,631
-The team assignments
have already

18
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:27,598
been announced and
posted at the Academy.

19
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:28,598
-Hey, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,131
That's not my problem.

21
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,131
Now, I've gotta get
back to my training.

22
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,331
-That's right.

23
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,165
Because you're going to
be hokage some day, right?

24
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,298
-I-- wha?

25
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,665
-I wouldn't have thought that
disappointing those eager,

26
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:44,931
young kids is something
a future hokage would do.

27
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,331
Being a leader, that's
what this mission is about.

28
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:49,998
Achieving a goal
while protecting

29
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,365
the lives of the
people on your team.

30
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:55,965
In fact, of all the
missions I could assign you,

31
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:59,831
this one's the ideal
training for becoming hokage.

32
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:02,165
-The deal training?

33
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,531
Really?

34
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,265
-But, if you don't want to do
it, you don't want to do it.

35
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:07,931
I'll just reassign your team.

36
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:08,631
-Hey!

37
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:09,631
Can't you take a joke?

38
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:10,731
I was kidding!

39
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:11,965
Joke.

40
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:14,631
[chuckles] I was only
pullin' your leg,

41
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:16,398
Grandma Tsunade, that's all!

42
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:17,065
I mean, come on!

43
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,465
Hokage training?

44
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,031
Like I'd ever miss that!

45
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,665
I was gonna do it
all along. [laughing]

46
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:22,898
CHOJI (TO HIMSELF): She
played him like a drum.

47
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,965
KIBA (TO HIMSELF):
Man, what a sucker.

48
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,331
HINATA (TO HERSELF): Oh, Naruto.

49
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:28,365
-All right, then.

50
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:31,931
Lemme just see who
I've got on my team.

51
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,031
Ugh.

52
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:34,298
[chuckling]

53
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,565
NARUTO: So, it's you guys, huh?

54
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:46,431
Hmm?

55
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:47,398
Hey!

56
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:48,865
What're you doing over there?

57
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,165
How'd you get out of this?

58
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,398
-Hey, it wasn't my decision,
but I'm glad they made it.

59
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,198
I knew this mission
would be a drag.

60
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:56,498
-We asked Shikamaru to
help the instructors keep

61
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,365
track of you and the students.

62
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,198
Now this will be an
outdoor training mission

63
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:03,898
that will take place over
two days and one night.

64
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,631
Your goal is the
great stone face

65
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:09,065
of Warudakame on the
summit of Mount Takurami.

66
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,898
Now it's important
that all team leaders

67
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:14,131
stick to the routes indicated
on the map, no deviations.

68
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,631
This is to ensure the safety
of the Academy students

69
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:17,865
accompanying you.

70
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:20,231
Along the way, you will
encounter instructors posing

71
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:24,198
as enemy ninja as well as other
obstacles, It won't be easy,

72
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,131
but you Academy students
will be fine, just as long

73
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,831
as you obey your team leaders.

74
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:32,398
You should see the great
stone face of Warudakame

75
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,898
after you've gone
about 80 kilometers.

76
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:38,098
There's a secret document
hidden there, and only one.

77
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:40,098
You see, this is a competition.

78
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:41,931
The team that
finds that document

79
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,165
and brings it back
safely to the village

80
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:46,398
will have successfully
completed the training.

81
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:47,298
NARUTO: You hear that?

82
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:49,231
That's us he's talking about!

83
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:49,965
OK, team!

84
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,731
Let's hear it!

85
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:52,198
You guys ready?

86
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,165
EVERYONE: Yeah!

87
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:03,265
-One of the most important
rules of survival in the wild

88
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,598
is learning how to
live off the land.

89
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:08,331
For instance, shinobi's
beef sashimi grass.

90
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,831
You can find it
all over this area.

91
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:14,465
You can eat it raw, which comes
handy if you're really hungry.

92
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,065
Om nom.

93
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:16,531
-Really?

94
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:17,065
-Awesome!

95
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,165
-Cool!

96
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:18,965
-OK, team!

97
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:21,398
Fan out and search for food!

98
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,565
[cheering]

99
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,831
-Here we are.

100
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:26,665
Heh.

101
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:27,165
Chow down.

102
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:28,265
-Hold it!

103
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:31,265
That's shinobi's blow
fish sashimi grass.

104
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,131
That stuff is poisonous.

105
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,998
[CHUCKLING[ If you
look carefully,

106
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,065
the shape of the leaf is
a little different, see?

107
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:38,998
-Oh yeah.

108
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,931
-Ha ha.

109
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,965
Everyone be careful
of what you pick, OK?

110
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:44,698
EVERYONE: Yes, sir!

111
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:45,665
-Mmm.

112
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:48,565
[chuckling]

113
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,965
-And that, my friends, is
the first rule of survival.

114
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:55,598
Knowing how to
find your own food.

115
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,931
MALE SPEAKER: Isn't going
to a store kinda cheating?

116
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:00,198
-This is so disappointing.

117
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,065
-I'm getting a bad feeling.

118
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,898
NARUTO: [singing to himself]

119
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,065
-That's funny.

120
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,965
-The geology in the
area throws magnets off,

121
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:16,098
makes it difficult
to use a compass.

122
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,865
I see you're wearing a watch.

123
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:18,698
-Uh, yes, sir.

124
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:20,498
NEJI: Look at it.

125
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:24,198
Draw an imaginary line bisecting
the angle between 12 o'clock

126
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,598
and the current position
of the hour hand.

127
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,831
Good.

128
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,665
Now if you point that
imaginary line toward the sun,

129
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:34,631
south will be at 12
o'clock, approximately.

130
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:35,831
Have you all got that?

131
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:36,531
EVERYONE: Yeah!

132
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:37,031
Got it.

133
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,331
-Hmmm, uh.

134
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:44,298
Uh.

135
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,665
Huh.

136
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,765
Huh.

137
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,065
Mmm.

138
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:52,031
-You thinking what I'm
thinking, Konohamaru?

139
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:54,565
-We're in trouble,
that's what I'm thinking.

140
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,565
He's definitely got us lost.

141
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,531
-Yeah, definitely.

142
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:01,231
NARUTO (TO HIMSELF): Man,
this is embarrassing.

143
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:02,965
Wait, there!

144
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:03,931
That's the way!

145
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,665
Come on, team!

146
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:05,798
Forward to victory!

147
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:07,398
FEMALE SPEAKER: You--
you sure that's the way?

148
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,931
--[sighing] Well, that was
tougher than I thought,

149
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,398
but I knew we'd get there.

150
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,231
-Get to where?

151
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,031
We're nowhere!

152
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,665
We're back where we started!

153
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:24,665
FEMALE SPEAKER: We were
counting on you, Naruto,

154
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,531
and you really let us down!

155
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:27,931
-Hmph.

156
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,765
OK, if you're so
smart, you try it.

157
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:30,331
-Sure!

158
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:30,898
Give it here.

159
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,998
Come on, it's that way.

160
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:39,031
[laughing nervously] OK, I
guess it wasn't that way.

161
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:41,498
-Hey, what's wrong, Konohamaru?

162
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:42,731
You lost or what?

163
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:43,498
Ugh.

164
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,431
-What's the matter?

165
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,831
Don't you know
how to read a map?

166
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,565
Let me try it.

167
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:47,798
-Sure, OK.

168
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,398
Knock yourself out.

169
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,865
-Hmm.

170
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:52,165
Let's see.

171
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:54,998
It's this way, obviously!

172
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:58,998
Boy, you guys are helpless.

173
00:07:59,031 --> 00:07:59,931
-Great.

174
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,398
Right back where
we started again.

175
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,365
-Wah!

176
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,365
We're lost!

177
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:04,331
We're doomed!

178
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,765
We'll never get
out of here alive!

179
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:07,565
-Guess I'll try.

180
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:08,298
Heh.

181
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,765
For what it's worth.

182
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,598
I don't feel so good.

183
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,531
Aaugh.

184
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,431
-Ahh!

185
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,198
-We're sure off
to a great start!

186
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:38,131
-Good job!

187
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:39,065
Everyone OK?

188
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:41,098
EVERYONE: Yes, sir, Lee-sensei!

189
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:43,531
--[gasping] What
did you just say?

190
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,098
EVERYONE: Why, yes,
sir, Lee-sensei!

191
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,365
LEE: Lee-sensei!

192
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:49,265
The sound of it!

193
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:50,631
Music to my ears!

194
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:54,098
This is the power of
youth, I can feel it!

195
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,565
Forward, men!

196
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:56,998
Forward into the setting sun!

197
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:58,431
EVERYONE: Yes, sir, Lee-sensei!

198
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,331
LEE: Let its golden rays shimmer
in the sweat of your efforts!

199
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,931
EVERYONE: Yes, sir, Lee-sensei!

200
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:09,865
-Ah.

201
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,598
They finally made it!

202
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:12,798
All right!

203
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,931
It's time we put Naruto
and his team to the test.

204
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,398
[gasping]

205
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,698
IRUKA: Listen up, Team Naruto!

206
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:21,998
Let's see what you've
learned so far!

207
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,265
Attack!

208
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:24,265
-All right, guys!

209
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,065
Formation One, hurry!

210
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,065
Sexy Jutsu!

00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,298
[poof]

212
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:31,665
-I've never known a man who
could resist this jutsu.

213
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:32,631
Wahh!

214
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:33,998
-Knock it off, you idiot!

215
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,265
[poof]

216
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:39,098
--[chuckling] Leave
it to us, Naruto!

217
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,531
-We'll show you how
it's done. [laughing]

218
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:43,465
-We've got a whole
new formation.

219
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,898
ALL: It's a cheesecake Jutsu!

220
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:46,898
[poof]

221
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:50,265
-Fashion model, yoohoo!

222
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,231
-Movie star, yoohoo!

223
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:55,998
-Tanning salon
receptionist, mmm.

224
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:58,465
ALL THREE: Cheesy,
cheesy, cheesecake!

225
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,398
-[burbling] Ahhh!

226
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,765
-Nicely done, guys!

227
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,631
It really looks like you're
starting to get the hang of it.

228
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,798
You just need to work on
perfecting your va-va-voom.

229
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:08,731

-Sheesh.

232
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:14,065
I keep thinking that one
of these days, Naruto,

233
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,098
you're gonna grow up.

234
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:28,931
-Hey, Iruka-sensei.

235
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:29,465
-Yeah?

236
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,565
What is it?

237
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:32,665
-I got a report from
the weather observatory.

238
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,065
[thunder cracking]

239
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:38,331
-Ahh.

240
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:40,365
It's nice and warm in here.

241
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:43,231
Boy, it sure was a good thing
we stopped and got ready ahead

242
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,598
of time.

243
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,831
-We'd be out there right now,
getting soaked and freezing

244
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:48,065
if we hadn't listened to you.

245
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,831
-A ninja always keeps
an eye on the weather.

246
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,231
Now do you see how
important it is

247
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:55,531
to be ready to take precautions
before any trouble starts?

248
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:56,698
-Yeah.

249

-Ahhh!

252
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:02,231
NARUTO: Get a grip, Moegi.

253
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:03,665
And pull out that tent flap.

254
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:04,298
Hurry!

255
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,098
[thunder cracking]

256
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,598
-Ahh!

257
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,565
I don't wanna do this anymore!

258
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,565
-This isn't just about
you, now come on!

259
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,031
Get a hold of the tent!

260
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:18,431
-I don't-- wahhh! [crying]

261
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,331
-Are they sure about this?

262
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:21,598
-Yeah, it's a big one.

263
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,731
And it's making a bee line
straight for the village.

264
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:24,398
-Terrific.

265
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:25,565
Now they tell us!

266
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,531
-The word from the
observatory was probably

267
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:28,998
delayed due to the storm.

268
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,731
-Well, I guess
that's that, then.

269
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,765
We're calling off the exercise.

270
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,898
Tell the teams to return
to the village at once!

271
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:36,265
-Right.

272
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:38,265
[thunder cracking]

273
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,731
MOEGI: I don't get it.

274
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,731
Why'd we pack up the tent?

275
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:44,198
KONOHAMARU: I don't remember
this trail on the map.

276
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,931
In fact, is this even a trail?

277
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,398
Where are we going, Naruto?

278
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:48,565
Why are we doing this?

279
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:49,831
-We Don't have time to rest.

280
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,198
We've fallen to far
behind the others.

281
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,931
This is the only way we're
ever going to catch up.

00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,798
-Huh?

283
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:56,665
You mean we're--

-Yeah.

285
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,198
We're going off the map and
we're gonna take a short-cut.

286

EVERYONE: Ahh!

287

put your heart and soul into it.

00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:35,344
We lost our tent, our
packs-- everything.

333
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:38,144
-It doesn't do us any
good to complain about it.

334
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,477
-Listen, you!

335
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,411
If you hadn't gotten your
foot stuck in my backpack

336
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:42,677
and nearly got me killed--

337
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:43,911
-Hey, whaddya mean?

338
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:45,711
If I hadn't, we would
have been blown away!

339
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,277
-Now, now.

340
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:47,111
Come on.

341
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,344
Let's not fight with each other.

342
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:49,644
-It's all because of you, Udon.

343
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,111
If you'd closed that
zipper like you were told--

344
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,244
-Yeah, I know.

345
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,777
-It's no one's fault.

346
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:55,911
We're all on the same team.

347
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:56,911
-It's your fault really.

348
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:58,944
You're the one who
led us off the map

349
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:00,244
on this wild goose chase!

350
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:00,911
-Yeah!

351
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:01,944
Konohamaru's right!

352
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:03,211
-Hang on.

353
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:05,811
-The only reason we had to
take that stupid short-cut

354
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,111
in the first place is because
you got completely lost!

355
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:09,077
-Who got lost?

356
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:10,711
-What, are you gonna
try and deny it?

357
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,344
-Well, you guys are the ones who
led us around in a big circle!

358
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,744
-We're not supposed
to be leading!

359
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:15,511
You are.

360
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:16,411
-A wise guy, huh?

361
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,344
-Stop it!

362
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:19,344
You're both acting silly.

363
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:20,044
-Stay out of this!

364
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,011
-I will not!

365
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:22,844
[stomachs growling]

366
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:24,844
-Ugh.

367
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:25,977
-I'm too hungry to fight.

368
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:27,544
What do you say we call a truce?

369
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:34,077
[rain pouring]

370
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,077
MALE SPEAKER: This
is where I found it.

371
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:38,144
IRUKA (TO HIMSELF): Naruto!

372
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,877
Can't that little fool
ever follow instructions?

373
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:44,844
The wind would have carried
from somewhere, right up there.

374
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:45,744
Come on, Shikamaru.

375
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:46,411
Let's find them.

376
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:46,911
-Right.

377
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:51,311
-That's it?

378
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,711
You need boiling water
to eat this stuff!

379
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,777
-The cake's the only thing
that doesn't require cooking.

380
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:58,844
-Not even a cracker.

381
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,177
-Will you guys stop complaining?

382
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:02,944
-This is supposed to
be survival training!

383
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:05,177
And you bring food you
have to make in a kitchen?

384
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:06,744
Yeah, what's the point of that?

385
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,911
-Careful, or I won't share
any of this with you.

KONOHAMARU: I want the biggest
piece, that's all I know.

390
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:18,777
MOEGI: I'm gonna
get the biggest one!

391
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,677
UDON: Please cut me one.

392
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,744
Please cut me one!

393
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:26,877
-Huh?

394
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:28,477
-Eat up, everyone!

395
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,777
-But, that's not right!

396
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:32,811
-How come you cut
it in threesies?

397
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:33,811
-You forgot about you.

398
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:35,544
Aren't you gonna have some?

399
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,544
-I was thinking about
back in the day when

400
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,711
I went without food one
time because I messed up

401
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:41,111
in my training.

402
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:44,877
Kakashi-sensei was mad because
my team had botched a mission.

403
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,577
We hadn't been pulling together.

404
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:47,911
Ahh!

405
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,744
How are we supposed to know
why you picked three people?

406
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:51,111
We didn't make the rules!

407
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:53,211
KAKASHI: It's so basic.

408
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,377
Teamwork!

409
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,911
NARUTO: I finally got
what he was talking about.

410
00:15:56,944 --> 00:16:00,444
A ninja can't just think about
himself and being the best.

411
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:02,444
You've got to think
about your comrades

412
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:04,011
and what's best for the team.

413
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:08,677
-Here,

414
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:09,177

00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,644
--[laughing] I'm not that
crazy about cake, anyway.

417
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:22,411
I'll just hang here
and-- [stomach growls]

-Oh.

419
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:26,711
-Your tummy doesn't
seem to agree with you.

420
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,844
-Why'd you bring it
if you don't like it?

421
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:29,844
-Here, come on, Naruto.

422
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:30,411
Eat up!

423
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,877

Watch your step, Shikamaru!

00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:40,911
-Got it.

427
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:42,844
IRUKA: What the devil
was he thinking,

428
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,444
leading those kids up here?

429
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:46,577
SHIKAMARU: Thanks a lot, Naruto.

430
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:50,311
Just what I wanted to be
doing on a night like this.

couldn't have been

00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,777
very long ago that they left.

--[sighing] I'll say
this for Naruto.

-Eyes on the prize, gang!

437
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,011
We're almost there!

438
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:09,977
-Not so fast!

439
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,477
We can't keep up
with you like that.

440
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,377
-It was a mistake
sharing our food!

441
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,744
We should have let him starve!

-Ooh.

get left behind!

Something's wrong.

There's nothing you can do!

-What's the matter, Naruto?

497
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:55,477
Have you forgotten what
you told us last time?

498
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,244
-A person can do anything--

499
00:18:57,277 --> 00:19:00,177
-If you put your
heart and soul in it!

500
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,644
-Did I really say that?

501
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:03,611
-OK, ready, Team Konohamaru?

502
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,077
Forward to the rescue!

503
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,011
-Yeah!

504
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:07,511
-Ahhhh!

505
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:17,744
[rocks crumbling]

506
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,111
-Be careful, you guys!

507
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:22,444
-Toss him over,
but easy does it!

508
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:23,911
-Just hurry.

509
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:24,411
Nngh.

510
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:29,344
[grunting]

511
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,311
-You did it!

512
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:30,977
Way to go!

513
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:31,811
Just don't drop it.

514
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:33,411
All together now, over the side!

515
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:35,311
-On three, guys!

516
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,711
-One, two, aaugh!

517
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:38,211
-Yeah!

518
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:38,911
-Yeah!

519
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,611
-We did it, we did it!

520
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:43,044
-We can move
mountains! [laughing]

521
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,844
--[sighing] Glad to be
out of that tight spot.

522
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,777
IRUKA (FROM BELOW): Naruto!

523
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,111
Are you all OK?

524
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:51,044
NARUTO: Iruka-sensei!

525
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:52,044
Shikarmaru!

526
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:53,044
IRUKA: Naruto!

527
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,044
Above you!

528
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,511
[rocks crumbling]

529
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:57,511

530
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,511
-Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

[poofing]

532
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:03,477
-Down the mountain,
as fast as you can!

533
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,977
-Ahhh!

534
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,444
[crashing]

535
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,444
-Naruto, watch out!

536
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,411
-Nngh.

537
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,911
-Is he alive?

538
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:17,411
-Rasengan!

539
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:20,377
[explosion]

540
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,377
[poof]

541
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:23,844
-Well, that's typical.

542
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:27,144
He's not happy unless he's
giving people a heart attack.

543
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,077
-Nice, Naruto!

544
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,511
That was really cool!

545
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,444
-Whoa.

546
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,344
Glad that's over.

547
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:33,744
-You said it!

548
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:37,577
[chuckles]

549
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,777
TSUNADE: So, who's going to
tell me how this happened?

550
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:42,177
-Well, you see,
it was like this--

551
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,677
-It was all on account of
our team leader, ma'am.

552
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,077
It was entirely his idea.

553
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:49,511
He took a short-cut
that was not on the map,

554
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,977
even though that was contrary
to the rules of the exercise.

555
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,811
-We tried to make
him see that this

556
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,811
was both dangerous and wrong.

557
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:57,611
-But he did it.

558
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:02,244
-Naruto insisted on going
ahead no matter what.

559
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:03,211
-Huh?

560
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,777
The verdict seems
to be unanimous.

561
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:07,777
Have you any last words, Naruto?

562
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,144
-You rehearsed that!

563
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,144
[laughing]

564
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,044
-That's not what I
meant by team work!

565
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:13,977
Thanks a lot.

566
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:14,744
-Naruto!

567
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:15,977
-Not another lecture!

568
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:17,177
I can't take it!

569
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:17,944
-Don't you dare!

570
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,011
Where do you think you're going?

571
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:20,511
Naruto!

572
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,570
[theme music]

573
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:03,770
NARUTO: Out of the
wilderness, he came.

574
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,670
Tall and thin as a whip cord!

575
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:08,803
A bounty hunter armed with
two wakasashi blades and eyes

576
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:09,970
cold as steel.

577
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:10,770
His target?

578
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:13,203
The master thief, Gosunkugi.

579
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:14,003
His methods?

580
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:14,970
Ruthless!

581
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,703
But what the
sidewinder doesn't know

582
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,603
is that another
hombre is already

583
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:20,437
hot on the master thief's trail.

584
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,137
Me!

585
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,170
And I always get my man!

586
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:29,903
Next time, "The Bounty
Hunter From the Wilderness!"
