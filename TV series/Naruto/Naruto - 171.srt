-That may be, but
there's no question

00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,418
she's in league with
the men who attacked us.

And anyway, our
hands are tied here.

Our mission is to protect

I mean all you have
to do is look at her.

42

She's obviously this demon

But there's got to be a
reason for all of this.

45
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:17,094
Maybe if we were to
go after her, then--

-Will you drop it already?

47
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:19,667
You're not going
to go after her.

You don't even have

-I overheard something.

There's an island
out here that's

at the heart of all those people

99

More than 10 years
ago, Orochimaru's lust

100
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,820
for knowledge and power
became so insatiable

101
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,861
that he gradually exceeded
the normal limitations

102
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:04,135
of a shinobi, and
began experimenting

with forbidden jutsu.

00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:13,057
-Oh, such a pity.

105

-Of course this all
became common knowledge

him far and wide in this world.

he think people are?

-Isn't it obvious?

We bust into their hideout.

We're going to march right in

think we should do?

-I leave that to you.

of our agreement.

167
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,383
Look, don't worry.

168
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,390
We'll have all the data
we need pretty soon.

169
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,428
I'll honor my promise.

170
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:15,268
Just as long as you don't
give me any reason not to,

171
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,638
is that clear?

172
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:17,641
-Yes.

173
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,281
-Well then, if it
is, why don't you

174
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,987
go and keep our
guests company, dear?

175
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:23,512
-Very well.

176
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,039
-You really are
cruel, you know that?

177
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:37,122
-It doesn't look like
anyone's home right now.

00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:37,646
-Sh!

179
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:51,958
-So what do you guys think
they're doing in here?

180
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:52,434
-Birds?

181
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,136
Or fish?

182
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:07,003
-Easy.

You're in a tight spot now, huh?

Don't you people get
tired of saving the day?

-You're the guy from last night.

-I recognize that face.

The Chunin Exams,
if memory serves.

-Yeah, you're right.

198
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,649
He was matched up against
Sasuke, wasn't he?

199
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,155
-You mean the guy
who was with Kabuto?

200
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,224
-You got that right.

201
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,731
Of course that was the
last time I saw him.

202
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,201
It's been awhile now.

203
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,609
-He used a jutsu that siphoned
off his opponent's chakra.

204
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:34,383
-You were the guy who sucked
up all of Sasuke's strength.

205
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,318
I remember now.

-Well come and
get it, you three.

207
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,698
Let me show you just how
much I've changed since then.

00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:41,366
-Fine.

209
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,235
Get ready, pal.

-His jutsu will be a problem
for your style of close combat.

Besides, we can't all
stick around here.

Amachi?

-I have to admit, I'm a little
surprised that you'd return,

00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,319
after all that
happened back then.

Where is Orochimaru?

00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:24,518
He's here now, isn't he?

243
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,500
-So, the curse mark's acting
up, even after he split.

244
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,772
I wouldn't have guessed
that was possible.

245
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,643
Well, you're half right, anyway.

246
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:35,845
Orochimaru was here.

247
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,822
But that was well over two
weeks ago at this point.

It doesn't matter to me.

251

-So you mean to tell me that
the pain I'm feeling right now

252
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,549
is from him being here
close to a full month ago?

You brought Genin.

Look at you, you're
all grown up now, Anko.

-Meet Amachi.

261

He's a medical ninja who's
teamed up with Orochimaru,

262
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,593
and conducts research here.

263

His master's not around, though.

264

This whole rigmarole
is Amachi's doing.

experiments are finished, pal!

-Crazy?

268
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,894
This isn't a joke.

269
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,902
I've devoted my entire
life to this research.

-Look here.

272
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:32,517
This girl is capable of adapting
to an aquatic environment.

273
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,756
Combining the ability
to breathe underwater

274

with advanced
strength and agility.

275
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,002
It's always been my
dream, a ninja corps

276
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,606
for underwater warfare.

277
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,812
And this girl here
is the first step.

278
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:45,917
-A ninja corps for
underwater warfare?

279
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,119
-That's right.

280
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:50,027
An unparalleled military
force that can move freely

281
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,865
on both land and sea.

282
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,538
Once I've done it, we'll
spread across the nations

283
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:57,880
and take complete control
of marine shipping routes.

284
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,617
Astounding, isn't it?

285
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,025
With that kind of strength,
the world will kneel before me,

286
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,166
and Orochimaru will rue the
day he abandoned my work.

287
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,538
But it will be too late!

288
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,176
-These are people
you're talking about.

289
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,713
They're not your tools.

290
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:12,749
-Oh, that's a shame.

291
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:14,954
I figured someone
your age would have

292
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:17,427
grasped the
importance of my work.

293
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,797
Well, no big deal.

294

You're just another bunch of
brainless guinea pigs, right?

Ha!

00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,034
-Thank you, Isaribi.

00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,739
-Come on, out of the way.

300
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:36,708
-I'm not moving.

301
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,961
-Aw, come on.

get you anywhere, kid.

-No!

-I don't get it.

I mean, he's the one
who did this to you.

-I know!

309
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:10,524
But, but I don't
have a choice now.

310
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:13,631
He's the only person who can
turn my body back to normal

311

again.

312
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,541
He promised me that he would.

313
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:18,276
Here, look.

314
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,756
-What are you?

315
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,293
-Look at me.

316
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,198
People in this world
judge others based solely

on their appearance.

318
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:32,611
They stay away when they
see me covered in bandages.

319
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,315
Imagine what they'd
do if they saw

320
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:36,821
a monster covered in scales?

321
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,327
I just want my body back, OK?

322
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,663
I want to be human.

323
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:43,270
I'll do whatever it
takes to be myself again.

324
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,108
-But you still are human.

325
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:47,247
It doesn't matter
what you look like.

326
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,053
And yet you're attacking
ships with these guys

327
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,924
and sending them to the bottom.

328
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,996
It's not a face that
makes someone a monster,

329
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,636
it's the choices they
make with their life.
