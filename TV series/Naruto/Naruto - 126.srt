00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,333
[theme music]

2
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:22,669
-Now, Sand Coffin.

3
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:27,936
I'll handle this.

4
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:31,869
-No, please.

5
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:32,769
Just back me up.

6
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,403
I got sand in my mouth!

7
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,069
Will you please let go of me?

8
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:53,103
-You're not doing anything
in your present state.

9
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:53,903
I've got this.

10
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:55,536
-Do not let your guard down.

11
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,203
He uses his bones to attack.

12
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:05,836
He can launch them like
you saw before, and forces

13
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,636
them to protrude from his body.

14
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,803
He is able to control
them all at will!

15
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:15,936
-You're Gaara of the Desert.

16
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,236
You wield sand.

17
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,636
Hence the name.

18
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,136
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Showdown!

19
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,536
Gaara Versus Kimimaro!

20
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:40,103
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): That
sand is a strong defense,

21
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:45,036
but he's definitely not
the close combat type.

22
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,503
Getting close will probably
be difficult, though.

23
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,403
Here he comes.

24
00:03:58,436 --> 00:03:59,403
Digital Shrapnel!

25
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:19,169
LEE (VOICEOVER): Nothing
is waste in his movement.

26
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:23,369
His level of Taijutsu
is considerable.

27
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:26,536
-His attacks and
defense are as one.

28
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,703
All achieved with sand.

29
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,603
But the sand which he
can wield is probably

30
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:36,503
limited to the amount
that fits in that gourd.

31
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,803
Gaara of the Desert.

32
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:40,269
Rather a foolish
nickname, isn't it?

33
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:47,469
You're nothing without
that sand of yours.

34
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,936
Why else would you go
through the trouble

35
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,936
of lugging it around?

36
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:57,369
-Sand Shower.

37
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,803
-What a surprise.

38
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:10,769
-But as long as I have
it, I can do anything.

39
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:13,736
The only fool here is you.

40
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,736
If I need more
sand, I can easily

41
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,203
use the Earth to make more.

42
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,203
LEE (VOICEOVER): Of
course, now I see.

43
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,969
All of thie time, he has
been feeding his own sand

44
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,203
into the ground, and
using it to grind up

45
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:28,669
the stones and the minerals
in the Earth beneath us,

46
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,136
creating new sand.

47
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,603
Gaara of the Desert.

48
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:37,069
They do not call him
that for nothing.

49
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:37,503
Amazing.

50
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,469
You did it!

51
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:47,469
-Almost.

52
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,603
Sand Burial!

53
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:06,303
When I look at this guy,
it reminds me of him.

54
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:07,303
Uchiha.

55
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:10,369
His eyes.

56
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,369
Sasuke had the same
eyes this guy does.

57
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:14,836
-The same eyes?

58
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,303
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
Seeking to prove

59
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,769
the value of their
own existence.

60
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,269
Eyes like that.

61
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:26,603
-Sasuke!

62
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:07,736
Sasuke!

63
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,969
Sasuke!

64
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,036
I know you're in here!

65
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:19,536
Come on!

66
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,403
Answer me!

67
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,469
I don't get it!

68
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:33,003
What's gotten into you?

69
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,936
[wicked laughter]

70
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:11,303
[wicked laughter]

71
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,769
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): I
don't hate the darkness.

72
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:31,703
It was in the darkness
that I was raised.

73
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:04,536
-Why?

74
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,036
It's not fair.

75
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,469
Why am I in a place like this?

76
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,536
Why me?

77
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,203
I don't get it.

78
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:11,036
What did I do wrong?

79
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:21,369
Is there really a
god watching over us?

80
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:24,069
And if God does
exist, how could he

81
00:09:24,103 --> 00:09:26,269
let something like
this happen to me.

82
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,703
Who's there?

83
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:35,203
-It doesn't matter who.

84
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:36,169
Get out.

85
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:46,736
Kimimaro, the time has
come for you to be of use.

86
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,169
Be ready.

87
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:52,469
For the sake of the Kaguya
clan, you will fight!

88
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:58,803
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): Yes.

89
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:01,036
Fighting.

90
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:05,003
That is the only
thing I can do now.

91
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:31,803
-Im-- Impossible.

92
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:46,536
-That sure was a
lot of pressure.

93
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,169
If I hadn't grown a membrane
of bone underneath my skin,

94
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:52,203
I would've been crushed
beyond recognition.

95
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,385
-More bones.

96
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,551
He's a monster.

97
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:11,818
A freak.

98
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:15,385
-Well, he certainly
is a nuisance.

99
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:17,585
-I underestimated you.

100
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:20,651
But that's the last time
I'll get caught in your sand.

101
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:31,551
-Sand Tsunami!

102
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,485
LEE (VOICEOVER): Whoa.

103
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:03,451
So much sand.

104
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:05,451
He cannot evade or attack.

105
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:23,918
To think that he could
change the terrain itself.

106
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,885
You-- You did it!

107
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:35,385
-No.

108
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,851
Not yet.

109
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,351
Giant Sand Burial!

110
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:53,085
LEE (VOICEOVER):
He is so powerful.

111
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:57,885
He is even stronger than
when we fought each other.

112
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:01,285
Well, surely this time--

113
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:03,618
-Why won't he give up?

114
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:04,751
-What?

115
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:09,585
[heartbeart]

116
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,551
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
I'm still alive.

117
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:14,951
If so, there must
be a reason for it.

118
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:21,618
MAN: We descend upon the
Village Hidden in the Mist

119
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:23,318
under the cover of night.

120
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,918
We all feel the sting
of the recent betrayal.

121
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,751
Well, tonight,
they'll see savagery

122
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,051
like they've never known!

123
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:38,485
Show these scum the ferocity
of our clan, down every last

124
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,451
a man, woman, and child.

125
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,585
-Yeah!

126
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:45,251
-What are you waiting
for, Kimimaro?

127
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,685
Get going, already.

128
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,951
-I'm not sure what to do.

129
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:51,618
-What's there to think about?

130
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:53,185
Go down to the
Village of the Mist

131
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:55,785
and kill every single
person you come across.

132
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,751
Just follow your instincts.

133
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:03,251
It'll come to you.

134
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,418
-Are you from the mist village?

135
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:19,218
-No.

136
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,685
-I-- I see.

137
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:25,185
Sorry.

138
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:32,651
-Haku.

139
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,685
-No, it's nothing.

140
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,518
Sorry, Zabuza.

141
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,018
-We don't have time
for daydreaming.

142
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,218
Get a move on.

143
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:40,718
-Right.

144
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,851
His eyes were the same as
mine, before I met Zabuza.

145
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:06,985
-Just a moment.

146
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,951
Hasty, aren't you?

147
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,418
Put your dagger away.

148
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,985
I'm not from this village.

149
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:25,485
What you're seeking is just
below this ridge, child.

150
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:26,985
Go on.

151
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:27,951
Have at it.

152
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,918
It seems they've begun.

153
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,918
The Kaguya clan.

154
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:40,151
What a bunch of idiots.

155
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:45,085
They understand nothing
other than the sword.

156
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,551
The days are gone when
a horde of savages

157
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:51,051
could go slaughtering
all in their path.

158
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:55,951
Brute strength is nothing in the
face of a regimented military.

159
00:15:55,985 --> 00:16:00,885
These fools are
rushing to their death.

160
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,885
-Are we all that is
left of the clan, then?

161
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:05,951
-That's right.

162
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:07,551
And it looks like
we're surrounded.

163
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:10,851
-Their defenses were stronger
than we'd thought they'd be.

164
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,718
-Nothing we can do about it.

165
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:16,118
Just take out as many of them
as you can before you go.

166
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:17,085
[laughter]

167
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:21,785
-Come o Let's show
them a good time!

168
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:23,885
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): What
is it that I fight for?

169
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,818
What am I?

170
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:30,651
Having none of these answers,
I continued to fight.

171
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:34,718
-The time has come
for you to be of use.

172
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,685
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
Someone needed me.

173
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,618
That was all that
got my body moving.

174
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:44,451
That-- and the
obvious, of course.

175
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:48,318
I had to fight in
order to survive.

176
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:51,818
[scream]

177
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:05,118
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
Dawn broke.

178
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:11,718
And I realized I was the
only one who had survived.

179
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,685
I'm alone.

180
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,651
Again.

181
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:19,685
I was on my own, wandering
aimlessly from place to place.

182
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,207
This is--

183
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:56,307
The flower from before.

184
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:01,285
Why are you blooming
in a place like this?

185
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,151
How come you won't
answer me, huh?

186
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:12,551
Oh, so you're going to
ignore me too, then?

187
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,285
Who cares, anyway?

188
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:16,618
It's not like anyone
will see you here.

189
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:17,785
-That will do.

190
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:26,985
Maybe, just maybe, there
is no purpose in life.

191
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:30,785
But if you linger a while
longer in this world,

192
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,985
you might discover
something of value in it.

193
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,485
Like how you
discovered that flower.

194
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,418
Or how I discovered
you one fateful night.

195
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:48,085
[laughter] Come.

196
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:49,285
It's time to go.

197
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:57,951
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
That's what

198
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:00,951
Lord Orochimaru
said to me that day.

199
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:04,818
But people are
born for a reason.

200
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:07,085
That's what I think.

201
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:11,385
They have something they're
meant to do with their lives.

202
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,718
And I am no different.

203
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:18,618
I was put on this earth to
protect Lord Orochimaru.

204
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:19,418
And his ambitions.

205
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:28,685
-Wait a minute.

206
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:29,218
What is that?

207
00:19:39,818 --> 00:19:41,651
-Sasuke, come on!

208
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,318
You've gotta come back!

209
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,585
Everyone's worried about you.

210
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,585
[laughter]

211
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:49,918
-Oh, man.

212
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,218
I can't see anything in here.

213
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,585
The darkness is too thick.

214
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:56,618
NEJI: Sometimes your eyes
are even better than mine.

215
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:58,951
-Huh?

216
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,118
-Sasuke is in the darkness now.

217
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,485
-Neji?

218
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:07,718
-If you stay here too long,
you'll never catch Sasuke.

219
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,218
-Neji!

220
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:12,585
You're right.

221
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:14,551
You were right about all of it.

222
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,518
What am I standing
around here here?

223
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,585
Just you wait!

224
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,651
I'm gonna bring
Sasuke home for sure!

225
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:22,751
If it's the last thing I do!

226
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:29,051
Sasuke!

227
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,418
GAARA: Sand Coffin!

228
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,718
-What is that form?

229
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:34,843

230
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:03,965
LEE: You saved me.

231
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,165
I am in your debt.

232
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:06,998
To think you could
do such a thing!

233
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:11,098
-He was persistent, but
this is the end for him.

234
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:12,965
He's not getting up again.

235
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:15,265
Brainwashed by Orochimaru.

236
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:17,532
-I wasn't brainwashed!

237
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:20,665
My master understands me.

238
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:23,398
How could you ever understand?

239
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:26,498
NARUTO: Next time, Vengeful
Strike, The Bracken Dance!
