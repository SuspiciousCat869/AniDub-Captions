00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,992
You're never going
to win against Neji

170
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,730
because he's--
well, he's a genius.

171
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:35,932
-A genius, huh?

172
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,568
What does that mean-- genius?

173
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:40,104
So I was not born with a
whole lot of natural talent.

174
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,606
Not gifted like Neji.

175
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,109
But I work hard and
I never give up.

176
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,044
That is my gift.

177
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,880
That is my ninja way.

178
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,515
-It doesn't change a thing.

179
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:49,684
-Huh?

180
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:52,487
-The sad fact is
you'll never beat me.

181
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,959
No matter how hard you work, no
matter how many times you try.

182
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,329
-That is not true
and you know it.

183
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:01,032
It is not true.

184
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,850
-True or not, you
didn't listen to them.

185
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:19,022
You, you never gave up.

186
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:24,362
-[screams] [grunts]

187

-[growling]

188
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:52,066
- [evil giggling] What good
do you think that'll do?

189
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,468
-I pity the kid.

190
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,871
Gaara will just toy with
him til he begs for mercy.

191
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:59,275
-Well, then, Gaara's
in for a long match

192
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,977
because that will never happen.

193
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:01,611
-Huh?

194
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:02,546
-Huh?

195
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,850
-Lee doesn't know
how to give up.

196
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:12,726
-[yells] [screams]

197
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,063
-Lee, will struggle on
long after the point

198
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:19,635
where anyone else
would have quit.

199
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:22,606
-If I cannot do 1,200
without a mistake,

200
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,609
then it is 2,000 kicks.

201
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,949
1,117, 1,118, 1,119, 1,100--

202
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:30,950
-Uh.

203
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:45,937
-[yells]

204
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,871
-Lee.

205
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,875
[chuckles] Taking
a break already?

206
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:50,776
-Huh?

207
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,744
[music playing]

208
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,257
-What is it, Guy Sensei?

209
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,528
If it is about my messing up
on the last assignment, anh,

210
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,665
I said I was sorry.

211
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:09,000
Anh.

212
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:12,371
-Lee, it's true you're different
from Neji and the others.

213
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,706
-Anh.

214
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,375
-You have no gift for
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

215
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:19,280
And your taijutsu needs work.

216
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:24,053
But, then again, you have a
gift that Neji doesn't have.

217
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,121
Not as flashy.

218
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,424
But perhaps even more important.

219
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,762
-You do not have to
make me feel better.

220
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:31,797
-You idiot.

221
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,400
You think I'd waste
my time with that?

222
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,935
No.

223
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,939
All I'm saying is that you
have the gift of perseverance.

224
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:41,643
And that's what makes
you a genius too.

225
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,378
-Uh?

226
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,315
Anh.

227
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,117
But is that true, Sensie?

228
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,053
Anh.

229
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:49,653
I wonder.

230
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:53,926
Unh.

231
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,661
I use to think so.

232
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:59,066
I use to believe that if I just
trained harder than Neji, two

233
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:03,238
or three times harder, I would
make myself strong enough.

234
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:06,175
But now I am not so sure.

235
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,279
I do not know if I will ever
be able to work hard enough

236
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,614
to be real talent.

237
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,589
That is why I'm always
taking out Neji.

238
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:19,059
I keep thinking all of
my efforts will pay off.

239
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,829
But it is always the same.

240
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,632
I am no match for him at all.

241
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,304
Every time we have a ninja
mission, my legs begin shaking.

242
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,677
I do not know if I can take it.

243
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,114
Sometimes it seems like the
whole thing is pointless.

244
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:39,919
Like I am a loser and I
will always be a loser.

245
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:45,927
[sobs] I do not know what to do.

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,329
-You're right.

247
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:50,000
All the effort is pointless if
you don't believe in yourself.

248
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,641
You know, Lee.

249
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:59,412
We're a lot alike, you and I.

250
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,548
-You mean the eyebrows?

251
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:04,352
-No, I don't mean our eyebrows.

252
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,288
You see, I was a loser too once.

253
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,124
-What?

254
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,258
You were a loser?

255
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,793
-Oh, yes indeed.

256
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:14,865
But I made myself the equal
of any ninja, even Kakashi.

257
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,968
And I did it through effort.

258
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,771
You say you want to
show the world you

259
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,641
can be a splendid ninja
even if you don't have all

260
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:23,810
the gifts that others
are blessed with.

261
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,681
That's your nindo,
your ninja way, right?

262
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,317
Well, I think
that's a fine goal.

263
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,920
As fine a goal as
I've ever heard.

264
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,789
And one worth sticking to.

265
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,163
Don't let anything
steer you off the path

266
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,498
you've drawn for yourself.

267
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:42,134
Forge ahead to the end.

268
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:43,403
Stick to it, Lee.

269
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:44,604
Make me proud.

270
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,308
Be everything you can be.

271
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:50,112
Will you do that for me, Lee?

272
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:50,746
-Yes, sir.

273
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,947
[music playing]

274
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:09,871
- [pants heavily] Guy
Sensei, thank you.

275
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:15,846
Unh.

276
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,018
-He can't go on.

277
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:23,623
Make him quit before
he gets himself killed.

278
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,192
-Bushy Brow.

279
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:26,760
-Hm.

282
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,936
-Hm?

283
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:34,637
-What?

284
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,239
-He's still able to--

285
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,674
-Move like that?

286
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,810
[music playing]

287
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:42,648
-I will make you proud, Sensei.

288
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:46,786
I will forge ahead,
follow my path to the end,

289
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,159
and become the ninja
I know I can be.

290
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:52,494
-Lee's smiling.

291
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,196
He's running for his life.

292
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,565
But he's still smiling.

293
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,699
-Yes.

294
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,236
But now it's
Gaara's turn to run.

295
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,005
-Uh?

296
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:04,643
The Leaf Village
Lotus blooms twice.

297
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,280
-I've heard that
somewhere before.

298
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,582
Yeah.

299
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,516
Lee told me that.

300
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,985
[gonging]

301
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:14,456
-Sakura, The Lotus of the
Leaf Village blooms twice.

302
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,196
When we meet again, I will
have become a stronger ninja.

303
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,664
I promise.

304
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,469
-But-- No, Guy, you didn't.

305
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,505
-Yes, Kakashi, I did.

306
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,044
-So that Genin, that boy, is
able to open the Eight Inner

307
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,214
Gates and use the Hidden Lotus?

308
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:36,585
-Hidden Lotus?

309
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,354
-That's correct.

310
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:44,095
-Well, if that isn't
the most-- [grunts] OK.

311
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:50,102
So then how many of the Inner
Gates is he able to open now?

312
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,038
-Five Gates.

313
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,105
-OK.

314
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,774
What exactly are these
Eight Inner Gates

315
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:54,743
you're talking about?

316
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,545
And the Hidden Lotus?

317
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:59,949
-The Eight Gates are like
valves or chakra limiters

318
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:04,455
that must be opened if one is
to release the Hidden Lotus.

319
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:06,558
-I'm still not following.

320
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:10,129
-There are Gates along
the chakra network located

321
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,698
at those points
in the body where

322
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,134
the chakra is most
heavily concentrated.

323
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,204
Starting at the head,
they are the Gate

324
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:20,409
of Opening, the Gate of Rest,
of Life, of Pain, of Closing,

325
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,847
of Joy, of Shock, and
the Gate of Death.

326
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:27,185
These are what are called
the Eight Inner Gates.

327
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,689
Their purpose is to
limit the flow of chakra

328
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,257
through the body.

329
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,228
But the Lotus exerts tremendous
pressure on these limiters,

330
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,497
eventually forcing
the Gates open.

[explosive bursting]

333
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,006
-This releases the
restraints on the chakra.

334
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,509
The result being that
a person's strength

335
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:49,515
can be increased
tenfold or more.

336
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,619
-The Primary Lotus opens
only the First Gate--

--the Gate of Opening,
releasing the brain's restraints

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,129
on the muscles, freeing a
person to bring forth its body

340
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,832
strength to it's full extent.

341
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:07,404
You'll see results.

342
00:18:07,438 --> 00:18:10,008
-And, uh, Hidden Lotus?

343
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,745
-At the Second Gate,
the Gate of Rest,

344
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,247
one's strength is
increased further.

345
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,917
And at the Third Gate,
the Gate of Life,

346
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:19,520
one enters the Hidden Lotus.

347
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,856
-Wait a minute.

348
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:22,858
Just the Primary Lotus
almost destroyed him.

349
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,360
He could barely move.

350
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:26,764
What's going to happen to
him if he takes it farther?

351
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:27,831
-Exactly.

352
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,267
-Uh.

353
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,736
-By opening all Eight Gates,
you could attain power

354
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,773
beyond even the Hokages.

355
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:39,480
The only drawback is you die.

-I don't know what this
boy means to you, Guy.

359
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:46,523
But I shouldn't have to
tell you that we never

360
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,459
bring our personal
feelings into play.

361
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,997
I wouldn't have thought
you were capable of this.

-Nothing at all.

368
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:02,711
That boy has something
important to prove.

369
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:06,482
And he's determined to prove it
even at the cost of his life.

370
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,155
-I want to show I can
be a splendid ninja

371
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:15,461
as well even if I do not
have ninjutsu or genjutsu.

372
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:18,331
I want to prove it
to the whole world.

373
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,869
-And I am determined to
help him reach his goal.

374
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:23,138
Not for his sake.

375
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:27,376
But because that goal
is worth reaching.

376
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:28,478
-All right, Lee.

377
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:30,013
I'm going to be teaching
you a new technique.

378
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,148
So pay attention now.

379
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,516
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. [cheers]

380
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,484
-OK, OK.

381
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:34,085
Enough of that.

382
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:34,853
-(LAUGHING) Yeah!

383
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,787
A new technique.

384
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,555
A new technique.

385
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,122
A new technique.

386
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,192
-(GROWLS) Lee!

387
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,728
I said pay attention.

388
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,831
-Ahyahah.

389
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:44,599
Right.

390
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:45,300
Pay attention.

391
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,234
Yes, sir.

392
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,104
-Let me first just
say one thing.

393
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,839
This technique is
even more forbidden

394
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:51,575
than the Primary Lotus.

395
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,243
It is not without danger.

396
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,480
But it will be your trump card.

397
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:56,682
-Ahp.

398
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,384
It will?

399
00:19:58,417 --> 00:19:59,752
-But listen.

400
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,923
You can only use this forbidden
technique on one condition.

401
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,760
One very strict condition.

402
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:06,661
And that is--

403
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:10,400
-[pants] And that is--

-Um-um.

407
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,347
-I don't know what you think
you're planning right now.

But this match is over for you.

And--

-I am not going to be the
only one to lose here.

416

Guy Sensei, please
let this work.

417
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,418
It is now or never.

that hard work pays.

I would not have gotten
this far if it did not.

426
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:01,471
Neji, Soske, Narato,
if you can win,

427
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,143
so can I. You did not think
I had a chance, did you?

428
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,246
But you did not know I
had an ace in the hole.

429
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,550
I have been saving it
until just the right time.

430
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,620
And that time is now.

431
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,954
-Next time, the Fifth Gate.

432
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,987
A splendid ninja is born.

00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,221
