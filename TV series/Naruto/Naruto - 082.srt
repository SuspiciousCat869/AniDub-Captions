[theme music]

2
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,222
KAKASHI: Water Style.

3
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:56,588
--[together] Water
Shark Bomb Jutsu!

4
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,688
-He broke out the
same jutsu that I did.

5
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:05,688
-Not that I'm
unhappy to see you,

6
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,155
but what are you doing here?

7
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:11,255
-Well, you know, I asked you to
take care of those two earlier.

8
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,088
But I guess I got
a little worried.

9
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:19,388
OK.

10
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:20,622
Talk.

11
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:22,922
What's a rogue ninja like
you doing in this village?

12
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,322
Kakashi Hatake.

13
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:36,688
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Eye to eye,
Sharingan Versus Sharingan!

14
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:54,055
NARUTO: What?

15
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:55,422
Aw, no way!

16
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,622
How come I get stuck
tagging along with you

17
00:02:57,655 --> 00:02:59,722
while you do research
for another one

18
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,222
of your pervy books?

19
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,488
-Look, kid, I can
assure you this

20
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:05,622
isn't just another
research trip.

21
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,188
There's a woman I have to find.

22
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:09,155
A very remarkable woman.

23
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,655
-Well count me out, old man.

24
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:13,088
I don't have time to help
you find a girlfriend.

25
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,855
I've gotta get busy
with my training.

26
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:17,055
-What training?

27
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,288
-It's time Kakashi-sensei
taught me something new,

28
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:21,088
like that Chidori thing.

29
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,655
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Why does he always

30
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,788
play favorites with Sasuke?

31
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,588
-I see.

32
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,522
Hm.

33
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,122
You'd just be wasting your time.

34
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:32,422
Chidori's not really your style.

35
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:35,722
And besides that, kid, the
woman we're looking for

36
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,055
is really beautiful.

37
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,788
I mean gorgeous.

38
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,255
-Like I care.

39
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,688
Look, Pervy Sage, who do
you think you're talking to?

40
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,822
I'm not some dumb kid you
can fool with lame excuses.

41
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,355
I'm not going!

42
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,355
-OK, fine.

43
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:51,422
Suit yourself.

44
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:52,788
And I could have
taught you jutsu

45
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:57,088
that made Chidori
look like kid's stuff.

46
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:01,688
Maybe I'll just see is
Sasuke wants to come.

47
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:02,322
-Right!

48
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,888
When do we leave?

49
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:06,355
I'll go pack my bag!

50
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:07,922
Stay right there, Pervy Sage.

51
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,055
I'll be right back!

52
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,188
Don't move!

53
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:14,555
-[sigh] What a knucklehead.

54
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,088
Still, you can't
help liking him.

55
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:33,255
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Those
eyes haven't changed.

56
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:37,055
This one's a true
heir of the Sharingan.

57
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:40,955
That means I've gotta
be ready for the worst.

58
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,722
-Well, well, what a surprise.

59
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:45,255
That's how you copied my jutsu.

60
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:47,755
So there really is
someone besides Itachi

61
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,722
with those crazy eyes.

62
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,755
You're Kakashi, aren't you?

63
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:54,388
The copy ninja.

64
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:56,588
-You can imagine my surprise.

65
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,822
I go to check out a couple
of lowlife vagabonds

66
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:01,555
in a tea house, and
I find none other

67
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:05,588
than Itachi Uchiha
and Kisame Hoshigaki,

68
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,055
the scourge of the
Hidden Mist Village.

69
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:09,288
-How about that?

70
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,455
You know my name.

71
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:13,055
I'm honored.

72
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,755
-I assume that bizarre
excuse for a sword

73
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:18,588
is one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist?

74
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,222
The one called Shark Skin?

75
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,522
[laughter]

76
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,222
-I heard that you and Zabuza
had it out a while back.

77
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,088
-Yes.

78
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:28,788
We did.

79
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:34,222
-Go ahead.

80
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,488
I'd love to cut you to ribbons.

81
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:38,322
-Kisame.

82
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,422
Stop it.

83
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:42,888
-Hm?

84
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:46,988
-If you take this man on,
it won't be without cost.

85
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:50,088
Furthermore, it will take
time, and the commotion

86
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:53,622
is liable to bring
more Shinobi running.

87
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:57,088
Your way is inefficient,
and unnecessarily risky.

88
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:59,322
Don't lose sight of our goal.

89
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:00,255
-Let's hear it.

90
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:01,655
What is your goal, exactly?

91
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:15,322
-We're looking for something,
and we know it's here.

92
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,022
-And what would that be?

93
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,355
What is this thing
you're looking for?

94
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:49,122
-My way is more
efficient than Kisame's.

95
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,255
-Ninja Art, Water Style.

96
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:54,755
Water Wall!

97
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,088
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): The speed
of his jutsu is incredible.

98
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,988
I didn't even see a hand sign.

99
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,388
The shuriken in
his hand were just

100
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:13,722
a ruse to distract me from
this water style attack.

101
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:15,322
-You're good.

102
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:18,455
You almost anticipated my moves.

103
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:21,155
Almost.

104
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:22,488
-A shadow Clone!

105
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:23,655
His speed is too great.

106
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,922
KISAME (VOICEOVER):
A water clone?

107
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:30,922
Heh.

108
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:32,155
I guess my village
should be honored

109
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,955
he's copied our jutsu so well.

110
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:39,322
-Nice job, Kakashi.

111
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:40,788
-Get back, Kurenai!

112
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:42,722
That one's the shadow clone.

113
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:46,622
-Kakashi!

114
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:47,955
Kurenai!

115
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:50,022
ASUMA (VOICEOVER): He just
blew up his own shadow clone.

116
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,422
[laughter]

117
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:58,622
-I'm gonna learn a new jutsu!

118
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:01,188
Now maybe I'll finally
get Sakura's attention.

119
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:02,988
And a kiss.

120
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,588
I can't wait to see
Kakashi-sensei and Sasuke

121
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:07,055
when I spring it on 'em!

122
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:17,922
-Are you all right?

123
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,288
-Stay on your toes.

124
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:29,355
This guy was made chief of ANBU
Black Ops when he was only 13.

125
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:30,655
-All right, he's tough.

126
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,422
We get it.

127
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,522
-Tough?

128
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,255
You haven't seen half
of what he can do.

129
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:41,222
-For someone who is
not of the Uchiha clan,

130
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,788
you have mastered
the Sharingan well.

131
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:47,655
However, not being one of us,
you lack our physical strength.

132
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,988
And that's something
you can't copy.

133
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,388
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He's right.

134
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:54,555
My body doesn't
have the stamina.

135
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:57,922
-Why is it that the Uchiha
clan is known by all,

136
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,622
and feared by all?

137
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,555
I'll show you what
the Sharingan can

138
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:06,388
do when it's wielded by a
true heir of the bloodline.

139
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,022
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
It can't be.

140
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,122
Oh, no.

141
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:13,155
-Close your eyes!

142
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:14,122
Don't look at his eyes!

143
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:21,788
Close your eyes!

144
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:22,754
Don't look at his eyes!

145
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,288
Listen, both of you.

146
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:30,154
Whatever happens, don't look.

147
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:33,821
If you meet his gaze,
you're finished.

148
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:35,821
I'm going to have
to do this alone.

149
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:37,854
My Sharingan against his.

150
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:40,454
-Indeed, your abilities
are impressive.

151
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:44,921
They might even be enough to
resist the Mangekyo Sharingan.

152
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:48,254
However, there is
something they can't

153
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,921
defend against-- this
special Sharingan

154
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:54,288
jutsu called Tsukuyomi.

155
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:57,854
Only someone with the
Sharingan and Kekkai Genkai

156
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,288
can defeat me.

157
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,254
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

158
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,221
-I wonder how much
of this someone

159
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,554
without the Kekkai
Genkai can take?

160
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,488
-So it was only genjutsu.

161
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:57,588
-In the Tsukuyomi, time and
space, even physical mass--

162
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,088
I control them all.

163
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:05,521
The next 72 hours will
be nothing but this,

164
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,721
over and over.

165
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,988
-[groans]

166
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,188
That's--

167
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:27,688
-Tsukuyomi.

168
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,654
Time and space.

169
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,521
Even physical mass.

170
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:37,821
I control them all.

171
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:42,221
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Keep calm.

172
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:45,621
It's only genjutsu.

173
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,054
-Telling yourself
it's an illusion

174
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:49,488
will do you little good.

175
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:49,988
-Huh?

176
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,321
Pain is pain.

177
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:58,554
Call it what you will.

178
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:00,521
[gasping]

179
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,788
-Do you feel it any less deeply
by thinking it's not real?

180
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:16,221
How long will it be, I wonder,
before your spirit is broken?

181
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:19,721
-[groan]

182
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:29,721
[heavy breathing]

183
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:55,488
-Only 71 hours, 59 minutes,
and 59 seconds to go.

184
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,854
-What?

185
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,354
No!

186
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:06,354
Only a single second has passed?

187
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:17,788
[yelping]

188
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:43,721
[heartbeat]

189
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:02,721
-Kakashi?

190
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:03,454
What is it?

191
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,388
Can we open our eyes now?

192
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:06,754
-No.

193
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:07,754
Not yet.

194
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:12,121
-What just happened?

195
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:14,388
One second the guy's talking,
and the next thing second you

196
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,054
hit the ground.

197
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,188
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Three days in that world,

198
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:24,621
and less than a moment
passed in this one.

199
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:28,054
Why not just kill me?

200
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:31,488
If he wanted to, he could.

201
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:32,688
-Hm.

202
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:36,488
After all that, the fool's
spirit is still intact.

203
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:39,821
Meanwhile, you risked
overusing those eyes of yours.

204
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:41,054
You know that's dangerous.

205
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:48,754
-This thing you've come for.

206
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:49,688
Is it Sasuke?

207
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:54,754
-No.

208
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:58,588
The legacy of the Fourth Hokage.

209
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,021
-What's he talking about?

210
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:00,888
What's he after?

211
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:13,454
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

212
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,621
KAKASHI: It's been a
long time, Jiraiya.

213
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:18,021
How many years since you've
even seen the village?

214
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:25,421
-Kakashi.

215
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:33,454
I'll train Naruto from now on.

216
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:35,654
The Third Hokage
was wise to place

217
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,588
the boy under your supervision.

218
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,821
He's been well looked after.

219
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,188
But even someone of your
remarkable abilities

220
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,521
might not be enough
to get him ready.

221
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:45,388
-Ready?

222
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:46,621
What are you talking about?

223
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,921
-I've been keeping a close watch
on Orochimaru all this time,

224
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,088
ever since the day
he left the village.

225
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,388
It was clear that he meant
to come back someday,

226
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,788
and it was important
to know what

227
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,388
he was planning in the meantime.

228
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,621
For many years, I
observed his movements.

229
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:06,954
But then--

230
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:09,254
-What?

231
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:12,754
-He became part of
an organization.

232
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,821
-Organization?

233
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:16,321
What organization?

234
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,554
What's its purpose?

235
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:21,621
-No one really knows
for sure, but it's

236
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,388
a roving gang of nine
like-minded shinobi

237
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,754
who call themselves
the Akatsuki.

238
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:30,554
At first, they stuck to small
scale cloak and dagger stuff.

239
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:33,321
Nothing dramatic, but you
knew something big was coming,

240
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,854
considering who they are.

241
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,588
These are not small timers.

242
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,588
Almost everyone in
the organization

243
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:44,454
is listed in the bingo book as
an S class criminal deviant.

244
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:49,088
For instance, that guy
Itachi's one of them.

245
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,654
When nine shinobi like
that get together,

246
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:54,288
it's not because they
want to do charity work.

247
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,454
I'm sure you've already
got an idea by now

248
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:57,621
as to where this is headed.

249
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,654
Recently, the group
started splitting up.

250
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:08,854
Orochimaru went off on his
own while others paired up

251
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:11,888
and dispersed through different
areas, searching for new jutsu

252
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:16,121
to master, and other
things as well.

253
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,121
-And one of these things
they're looking forward

254
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,421
is the Nine-Tailed Fox?

255
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:24,554
-It's only a possibility,
but it makes sense.

256
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,121
After all, the Nine-Tailed
Fox has an incredible amount

257
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:30,254
of chakra.

258
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,054
Kakashi, sooner or
later, Naruto must

259
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,554
learn that, because
of what he is,

260
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:39,054
he'll have to live his
life watching his back.

261
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:40,388
That's the boy's destiny.

262
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:47,354
For now, focus on Sasuke.

263
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,554
It's up to you to teach him
how to use his Sharingan.

264
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,354
And I'll keep an eye on Naruto.

265
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:55,588
Leave his training to me.

266
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:05,754
-The Nine-Tailed
spirit inside Naruto.

267
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,788
That's what you're after?

268
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,054
You're not the
only ones, are you?

269
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,988
There are seven more of
you out there, searching.

270
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,254
Hunting.

271
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,521
I know all about you.

272
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,188
You call yourselves
the Akatsuki, right?

273
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,488
-Akatsuki?

274
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,288
-Kisame, we'll take
Kakashi with us,

275
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:29,054
but we don't need the others.

276
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:33,621
Get rid of them

277
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,088
-Severe Leaf Hurricane!

278
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:49,454
-Well, who have we here?

279
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:53,088
-The Leaf village's
fiercest beast of battle.

280
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,754
I'm Might Guy.

281
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,621
-You're Might Guy, huh?

282
00:18:57,654 --> 00:18:59,921
Mighty stupid looking Guy.

283
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:02,054
-Don't underestimate him.

284
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:03,821
GUY (VOICEOVER): It's him.

285
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:04,321
Itachi.

286
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:16,121
Oh, what they must've
put him through.

287
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,054
-Close your eyes.

288
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,621
Don't look at Itachi.

289
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:20,421
You'll get caught in his jutsu.

290
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:21,588
-Relax.

291
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,288
I know what I'm doing.

292
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:26,154
After spending this much time
training to fight Kakashi,

293
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:27,654
I know all about Sharingan.

294
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:32,954
All right, both of you,
open your eyes, now.

295
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,888
-But, if we--

296
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,288
-Don't worry, just
don't look in his eyes.

297
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:40,221
That's the key to fighting an
opponent who's using Sharingan.

298
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:41,454
Focus on his feet.

299
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:45,621
You can read what he's
gonna do from his feet.

300
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,654
-All right, but that
trick sounds a lot easier

301
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,188
said than done.

302
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,321
-We haven't had
all your training.

303
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,821
We're not you, Guy.

304
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,121
-True.

305
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:57,121
It takes skill to anticipate
an opponent's moves merely

306
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,021
from watching his feet,
but I don't have time

307
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:00,654
to teach you now.

308
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:04,421
You'll just have
to do your best.

309
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,088
-So what do we do?

310
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,454
-Kurenai, get Kakashi
to the Medical Corps.

311
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,488
Asuma, you'll be my backup.

312
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,988
-Got it.

313
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,388
-All right.

314
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,521
I sent word for the ANBU Black
Ops, but until they get here,

315
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:20,088
we hold them off.

316
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:21,488
Just you and me.

317
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,254
-Interesting.

318
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,588
I'll give you credit for guts.

319
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:25,954
-No, Kisame.

320
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,754
We're pulling out.

321
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:31,621
We're not here to fight
a full scale battle.

322
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:34,921
Tempting as it may be, it's
not the way to do this.

323
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:37,321
Let's go.

324
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:38,721
-That's too bad.

325
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,854
It was just getting fun.

326
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,821
They don't know
how lucky they are.

327
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,954
-All right, I'm ready.

328
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,854
Let's move out!

329
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:14,488
-You, uh, don't think you might
have overdone it a little?

330
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:17,188
You do realize we're not going
on a trip around the world,

331
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:17,654
right?

332

00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:00,467
JIRAIYA: Woo hoo!

334
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,467
Now that's a lady.

335
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,534
Ha cha cha cha.

336
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,367
-Whoa, you're right!

337
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,900
She's pretty!

338
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,334
Hey, she winked at me.

339
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,000
JIRAIYA: No offense, kid, but it
wasn't you she was winking at!

340
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,500
-She's maybe even
prettier than Sakura!

341
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:12,767
-OK, Naruto!

342
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,867
I've got research to do.

343
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,500
Finish your training
and go to bed.

344
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:16,434
-No way!

345
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:18,834
Stop treating me
like I was a kid!

346
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,500
Next time, Jiraiya!

347
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,000
Naruto's Potential Disaster!

348
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:28,167
You're the one who needs
more sleep, old man!
