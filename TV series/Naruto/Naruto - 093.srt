[theme music]

2
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,929
-So that's your answer, Tsunade.

3
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:04,529
After all I've offered
you, you would repay me

4
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:08,029
by trying to kill me.

5
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:11,929
Fortunately, I can depend
on Kabuto's loyalty.

6
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:15,529
A good thing he arrived in time
to see the evil intent hidden

7
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:18,863
in those healing
hands what of yours.

8
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:19,863
-Yes.

9
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,896
She and I are from
the medical corps.

10
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:24,829
I could tell she was building
up her chakra for an attack.

11
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,696
-Tsunade, Tsunade.

12
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,629
And I was going to restore
your loved ones to you.

13
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:36,696
I even agreed to
give up my dream

14
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,096
of destroying the Leaf village.

15
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:52,129
-As to that, Orochimaru,
I knew your promise

16
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:56,696
to leave the village alone
was worthless, a lie.

17
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:59,763
But even so.

18
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:08,463
Even though I knew
that, the chance

19
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,629
to see them both one more time.

20
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:16,229
To see them once more,
if only for a moment.

21
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:23,463
To be able to touch them, to
feel them, just once more in.

22
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,829
To see their precious smiles.

23
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:30,196
I'm weak.

24
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:32,396
So weak that, for
a moment, I would

25
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:37,396
have sacrificed everything
just to see them again.

26
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:40,229
Just once.

27
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,863
For that, I was
willing to throw away

28
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:44,029
the villages and the
lives of everyone in it.

29
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:53,429
To think that I
could've been so blind.

30
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:57,029
But the memory-- It was
a memory of their faces.

31
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,196
-Hey, big sister!

32
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,729
MAN: Tsunade.

33
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,629
-I love them.

34
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,329
I love them both so much.

35
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:07,663
The chance to see them again.

36
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,563
To hold them in my arms!

37
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:21,796
But then, something happened

38
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,896
-I said it, and I never
go back on my word.

39
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:30,263
-That boy, he made me
remember something.

40
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:33,563
Something I've been
trying to forget.

41
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:36,929
-This entire village meant
a lot to our grandfather!

42
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,029
And I'm gonna take
good care of all of it.

43
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:42,563
After all, I'm the grandom
of the Hokage, the man who

44
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,196
built the village
hidden in the leaves!

45
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,629
-I love this village and the
people in it with all my heart.

46
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,029
I want to protect them.

47
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,129
-Right.

48
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:57,263
And I give my work, I'll follow
our grandfather's footsteps

49
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,729
and be just like him!

50
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:02,663
-Unlike you, I
admire the Hokage.

51
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:07,163
It's my dream to be like him
some day, no matter what.

52
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:10,796
-I want to lead them in building
a better world than this.

53
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:14,163
It's been my dream ever
since my sister died.

54
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:15,796
It's all that's kept me going.

55
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,529
-To be Hokage.

56
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:26,496
That's my dream!

57
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,396
-That's what he
made me remember.

58
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,863
The dream they shared.

59
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:34,429
The dream they gave
their lives for.

60
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,829
It meant everything to them.

61
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:44,263
You said once that all things
on Earth crumble and fade away.

62
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,429
I wish that were true.

63
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:00,363
I only wish this
feeling would go away,

64
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:01,563
but I know it never will.

65
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,563
-It seems we've
reached an impasse.

66
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,396
So be it.

67
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:14,596
I'm afraid you give me no
choice but to use force.

68
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:25,196
NARUTO: Breakdown!

69
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:25,929
The Deal is Off!

70
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:42,596
-Come on, Orochimaru!

71
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,129
-It's amazing that
in all this time,

72
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,629
you and I have never
actually met in combat.

73
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:55,563
-That's right.

74
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,063
-Don't get your hopes up.

75
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,029
You still have to go through me.

76
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:00,229
-No matter.

77
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:05,029
It'll be a pleasure
killing you both right now!

78
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,696
-She hasn't lost
any of her strength.

79
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,196
It won't go well for you
if she ever connects.

80
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,663
-I can see that.

81
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,263
This is not the battlefield
I would've chosen.

82
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:18,563
It's too cramped here.

83
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,396
-A change of scenery?

84
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:21,229
-Yes.

85
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:23,363
I think a change would be wise.

86
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,996
When I found her
attendant, she was

87
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,729
with someone who might
prove troublesome to us.

88
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,196
They could be here any minute.

89
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,596
-This troublesome someone.

90
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,563
Who is it?

91
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,029
-One of the Sannin, same as you.

92
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,863
-Jiraiya.

93
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,996
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
No you don't.

94
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,529
I'm going to finish this.

95
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,396
NARUTO: Whoa.

96
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,896
What the heck happened here?

97
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,096
-Well, well.

98
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,029
I'd say something put
Tsunade in a bad mood.

99
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:15,296
She's got a foul temper.

100
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,329
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): So, this
must mean she refused him.

101
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:22,829
-Well, OK, but where's
the grumpy old bat now?

102
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:29,629
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): Her jacket.

103
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,763
Which way?

104
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,529
Well, Tonton?

105
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:37,329
-Oink.

106
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,529
-OK, let's go!

107
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,529
-Out of breath already?

108
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:01,729
Well, none of us are
getting any younger, are we?

109
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,063
Time to end it.

110
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,929
-Taijutsu was never
my forte, but--

111
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,629
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
A food pill?

112
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,029
That hand sign!

113
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:30,963
So, he knows medical
ninjutsu, too.

114
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,963
My arm.

115
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,129
-Yes.

116
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:03,763
I've weakened the muscles
of your right bicep

117
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,896
and your left thigh,
just enough so you

118
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:09,229
won't be able to reach that
incredible strength of yours.

119
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:11,596
-A chakra stopper, huh?

120
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,363
Well, then why not
just go for the kill?

121
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,429
-That's true.

122
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:17,963
With this scalpel, I
could sever an artery

123
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:21,496
or puncture your heart without
even breaking the skin.

124
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,396
But of course, that requires
careful aim, and a long blade.

125
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,129
Both of which are
difficult to accomplish

126
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:29,029
in the heat of battle.

127
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:33,163
But that said, perhaps if
I just aim for your neck!

128
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:44,963
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Damn!

129
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:47,063
He hit my intercostals.

130
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,029
Can't breathe.

131
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:52,229
This kid's no ordinary
medical ninja.

132
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:55,663
I was never that
quick, or precise.

133
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,463
Even in my prime.

134
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:01,963
-Have to be careful to avoid
hitting anything too vital.

135
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,063
We don't want you
dying just yet.

136
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,329
Still, you're not going to
be moving much anytime soon.

137
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:07,829
Huh?

138
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,863
(VOICEOVER) I
underestimated her.

139
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,196
She shouldn't still be
conscious, let alone--

140
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,063
All right, then.

141
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:33,163
I guess I'll have to
stop going easy on her.

142
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,629
It'd be so much easier
if I could just kill her.

143
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:52,563
I try to move my right arm--
and my left leg tenses.

144
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:55,029
No-- she couldn't have--

145
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:58,429
-Surprise!

146
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:06,829
(VOICEOVER) I can
only hope it worked.

147
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,829
Because that was
about all I've got.

148
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:20,196
-Now I see.

149
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,096
-Nothing's responding right.

150
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:23,296
But it's not my muscles.

151
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,929
I see you've finally
figured it out.

152
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:32,496
It's your whole nervous system.

153
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,896
I turned my chakra
into electricity,

154
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,496
then sent an electrical charge
ripping through your body.

155
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,396
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
She attacked his lines

156
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,563
of communication, scrambling
the electrical impulses that

157
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:49,696
carry messages from the brain
to different parts of the body.

158
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:53,263
Cut off from the brain, his
body doesn't know what to do.

159
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,996
She's literally
short circuited him.

160
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:58,663
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
To be capable of this

161
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:02,929
in her condition-- but then,
she is one of the Sannin.

162
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:07,463
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
Don't have enough chakra

163
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,129
for a healing jutsu.

164
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,096
But I have to do what I can.

165
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,496
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
When I try to move

166
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:24,863
my right hand-- my
left leg responds.

167
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:30,196
And trying to move my left
ankle moves my right shoulder.

168
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,929
It's tricky, but I think-- yes.

169
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:54,129
I think I've just about
figured out what moves what.

170
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:57,096
Though you had me, didn't you?

171
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:57,563
Surprise.

172
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,429
Now, then!

173
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:03,763
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Impossible!

174
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:05,496
He could never have
recovered so quickly!

175
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,763
-So, you fear the
sigh of blood, eh?

176
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:10,829
Let's put it to
the test, shall we?

177
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,558
-Jiraiya?

178
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:46,091
-It's been a long
time, old friend.

179
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,325
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Orochimaru.

180
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,025
Long time, indeed.

181
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:53,325
And I can't say it's improved
your looks any, old friend.

182
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,191
-Huh?

183
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,158
Hey!

184
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,525
Kabuto.

185
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,025
-Naruto.

186
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,758
-You've met this
guy before, Naruto?

187
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,225
-Well, of course I have.

188
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:15,825
We took the Chunin
exams together.

189
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:19,758
What are you doing here, Kabuto?

190
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,191
-Out of the way!

191
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,225
Oink!

192
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,691
-Stay outta this!

193
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,191
I can handle them!

194
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:31,125
So, you recovered quickly.

195
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:31,625
No matter.

196
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,025
You're still not at 100%.

197
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,525
The game's up, kid.

198
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:44,991
too late for that!

199
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:45,491
-Ah?

200
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,358
-Your jutsu's worn off.

201
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,325
Now I am at 100%.

202
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,391
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Blood.

203
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,025
-I knew that I'd
never be able to take

204
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:08,325
on two of the legendary
Sannin at the same time.

205
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:12,725
But now at least I got one down!

206
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,691
-Lady Tsunade!

207
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,758
-I don't get it.

208
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,458
What's going on?

209
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:18,291
I'm confused.

210
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,158
Did I miss out on something?

211
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:23,725
How come Kabuto and Grandma
Tsunade are mixing it up?

212
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:29,491
-I see you're as
slow as ever, Naruto.

213
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:32,258
No wonder you're no
match for Sasuke.

214
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,825
-Huh?

215
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:38,058
-If you want your answer,
just look at his headband.

216
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:39,325
He serves Orochimaru.

217
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,691
-That's right.

218
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:47,125
I'm a spy from the Village
Hidden in the Sound.

219
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:52,325
-But-- a spy?

220
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:53,858
That's impossible.

221
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:57,291
You don't really mean it?

222
00:16:57,325 --> 00:17:01,091
But you-- you helped us get
through the Chunin exams.

223
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,025
You saved our lives.

224
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:06,858
-Only in order to gather
information about all of you.

225
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,358
That was my mission.

226
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:12,458
Indeed, I learned one
very important thing

227
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,391
about you, Naruto.

228
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:20,491
You lack any ninja ability.

229
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,591
You're not a bit like Sasuke.

230
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:37,058
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): I've
never seen her like this.

231
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:37,558
Never.

232
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:54,091
You don't have to do everything
by yourself, you know?

233
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,458
Let me help.

234
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,658
I'm here to serve you.

235
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:59,158
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Grandma Tsunade.

236
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,591
-Go on, glare at
me all you want.

237
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:09,591
You're still just a pint
sized Genin in over his head.

238
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,258
I admit that the demon inside of
you had me worried for a time.

239
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,891
But surrounded by three
of the legendary Sannin,

240
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:19,858
I see how insignificant you are.

241
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,925
Next to them,
you're a mere child

242
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,825
sitting at the grownups' tables.

243
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:28,125
Stay out of it-- or die.

244
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,725
-Oh, yeah?

245
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,425
-Naruto, no!

246
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,491
(VOICEOVER) My
body's still shot.

247
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:38,891
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
His right hand.

248
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,325
I think it's hurt.

249
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,758
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

250
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,791
I'll hit him with
multiple attacks.

251
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:52,758
Then come at him from the ride,
where his defenses are weak!

252
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,258
Ha!

253
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,625
[inaudible]

254
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:01,325
My eyes!

255
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,925
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
Poison needles!

256
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,358
My reflexes are still out.

257
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,825
I can't dodge them.

258
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:30,258
If I can just--

259
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,225
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):He blocked
them with his headband!

260
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,425
-Impressive move.

261
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,458
I'll give him that.

262
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:41,091
-Thanks, Shizune.

263
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:50,758
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
So that's it.

264
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,191
Plasma pill.

265
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:57,158
-Plasma pill?

266
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:03,825
-Well, of course.

267
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:06,225
He's trying to replace the
blood that he's already lost.

268
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:08,491
-So, he's a medical ninja.

269
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,725
Like me.

270
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:14,291
-We can't have too much
blood, can we, Kabuto?

271
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:18,158
-Lord Orochimaru, isn't it
time to take the bandage

272
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:18,691
off your arm?

273
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,358
-So that's Orochimaru!

274
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:41,258
-Well, now we can finally
get down to business.

275
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,191
Shizune.

276
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,325
-Yes.

277
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:47,391
-I'll let you take care
of four-eyes over there.

278
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,025
Just leave Orochimaru to me.

280
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,840
-Am I supposed to be
impressed, Kabuto?

281
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:04,440
You gutless creep, picking
on the old lady like that!

282
00:23:04,474 --> 00:23:06,440
Even though she
might not look it.

283
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:07,440
Hey.

284
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:08,874
And speaking of which,
you still owe me

285
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:10,174
that necklace, Grandma Tsunade.

286
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,407
I don't care if
it's unlucky or not!

287
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,140
We made a bet, and
I aim to win it!

288
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,674
I said I would, and I
always stand by my word.

289
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:20,074
That's my ninja way!

290

Next Time, Attack!
