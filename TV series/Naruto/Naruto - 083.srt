-Well?

00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,004
Come on, Pervy Sage!

4
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,271
I'm on pins and needles.

5
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:02,104
What's this new jutsu
you're gonna teach me?

6
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:05,938
The last time around it was
the walk on water jutsu!

7
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,338
Ooh, is it walking through fire?

8
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,538
Or wait.

9
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:13,438
Maybe walking on air.

10
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,671
Aw, come on, Pervy Sage!

11
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:17,204
Let's hear it already!

12
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,171
-All right.

13
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,338
Enough with the
Pervy Sage already.

14
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,871
You have no idea how
amazing a guy I am, do you?

00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:24,571
-What?

16
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:25,738
Amazingly pervy?

17
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:26,804
-Gah!

18
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:31,238
You-- All right, listen up.

19
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:34,671
The Toad Sage is only my cover.

20
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:38,971
Allow me to reveal
my true identity.

From the north to the south
and the east to the west,

Not even the spirits

The White-Maned Toad Charmer!

That's 10 kilometers from here.

No, it's Otafuku town.

I told you already,
it's Jiaraiya.

41

Come on.

42
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,971
-So, the fact that suh a big
wig Pervy Sage chose me as his

43
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,671
travelling companion must
mean something, right?

44
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,104
I must be a potential
genius in the making.

45
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:58,004
Aw, man.

46
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,204
It's just like I always thought!

47
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:03,838
Come on, come on, come on.

48
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:04,838
Why'd ya choose me, huh?

49
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:09,971
-Well, the truth is,
kid, a long time ago,

50
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:13,638
the Fourth Hokage used
to be a disciple of mine.

51
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,971
-Huh?

52
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,371
-And you bear such a striking
resemblance to the Fourth

53
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:19,738
that it's almost laughable.

54
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:23,938
Sorry, that's the only
reason I got for ya.

55
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,438
-So, wait.

56
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,571
I'm like the Fourth?

57
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,938
Holy crap!

58
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,904
That's awesome!

-Oh, man!

61
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:39,171
If I'm like the
Fourth Hokage, that

62
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,404
means I possess the same
level of genius he did!

63
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,771
I'm on my way to
Hokage after all.

64
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:44,271

00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:05,138
Ah, no, I just stepped
in some dog doo!

72
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,738
-The only similarities you
share with the Fourth Hokage

73
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:11,138
is pigheadedness and that
spiky blond hair of yours!

00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:15,404
-What was that, you
senile old perv?

-OK.

dumplings over to Ino's house?

-To Ino's house?

82
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:42,338
These?

Don't be a bother and
stay too long, all right?

Everyone is so busy these days.

00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:50,204
-Yeah, Mom, I know.

87
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:51,504
See ya in a bit.

88
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,671
Oh, hey.

89
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:02,638
I should bring some of these
over to Sasuke later, too.

90
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:05,171
I wonder if he
has a sweet tooth.

91
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,271
Oh, and Naruto, too.

92
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:08,904
He'd probably eat
just about anything.

93
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,271
-Hey, Kakashi-sensei.

94
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:16,938
Can you teach me Chidori, too?

95
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,571
-Look, I know you want
to learn, but it's not

96
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:20,838
as simple as all that.

97
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,104
-What the heck is that?

98
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,404
How is that fair?

99
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:25,838
Come on, show me!

100
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:28,738
-Sasuke, thank you.

101
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:31,404
I mean, you know, you protected
me from the sand, right?

102
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:35,804
-No.

103
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:36,304
-Huh?

104
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,538
-All right.

105
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,071
To start, try gathering up
some chakra in your palm.

106
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:44,538
-Ha!

107
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,304
Got it!

108
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:50,471
-It wasn't me who rescued you.

109
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:53,871
It was Naruto.

110
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,238
-Am I getting it?

111
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,004
Am I getting it?

112
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,271
-Oh, come on, Sasuke.

113
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:02,071
You're just being
overly modest again.

114
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:04,804
Sure, Naruto's gotten stronger,
but against a sand ninja?

115
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:05,971
-I'm telling you the truth.

116
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,938
You should have seen him.

117
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:16,704
Naruto fought tooth and
nail to save you, Sakura.

118
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:20,571
He displayed a kind of strength
he'd never shown before.

119
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:21,904
-Naruto--

[groan]

121
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:25,471
-Rescued me?

122
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,504
-Come on-- Chidori!

123
00:07:31,404 --> 00:07:34,304
Chidori!

124
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,738
What the-- Chidori!

125
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:36,238
Chidori!

126
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,604
-Right.

127
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:42,871
I'll save some for Naruto, too.

128
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:03,938
-I wasn't-- I wasn't
able to do anything.

129
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,638
I don't ever want to
have to see that again.

130
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:14,704
Watching all my best friends
falling right in front of me.

131
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:22,338
-No matter what happens, I
swear I'm going to protect you.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Naruto j
gets stronger and stronger.

135
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:49,838
Compared to him, I--

136
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,604
-I'm pretty certain you
could go toe to toe with him.

137
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,504
Though I'm not sure I could.

138
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:18,471
He's on a whole other level.

139
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:19,938
-Yeah.

140
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:23,304
If we faced each other,
both of us would be killed.

141
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:26,804
A rather unappealing outcome.

142
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:29,471
Even if there were
more of us, the result

143
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,171
would remain the same.

144
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,104
-Never thought I'd have
to go up against one

145
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,938
of the legendary Sannin.

146
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:39,171
If we fight him, then
both the Uchiha clan

147
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,904
and the Seven
Swordsmen of the Mist

148
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:43,938
will have their names
dragged through the mud.

149
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:45,138
-True.

150
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:49,638
But still, even the
strongest of opponents

151
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,104
always has a weakness.

152

You'll be cursed.

158
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:17,676
[giggling] NARUTO:
Hey, pervy sage.

159
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,843
-Hm?

160
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,743
-What kind of a student
was the Fourth Hokage?

161
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,210
-Well, I think
it's safe to say he

162
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,576
rose to greatness
because of my tutelage.

163
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,443
So to land me as a
sensei-- well, kid,

164
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:31,710
let's just say you
hit the jackpot, OK?

165
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:33,476
-Huh?

166
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,176
-Oh, what?

167
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,543
You don't believe me?

168
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:38,276
A good sensei will naturally
beget good disciples.

169
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,576
That goes without saying.

170
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,276
-So wait a second, pervy sage.

171
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,843
If that's true, then who
did you have as a sensei?

172
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,343
-Who, me?

173
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:48,076
I first studied under
the Third Hokage.

174
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,743
-The Third, huh?

175
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,110
-Yep.

176
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:53,710
This was back when the Third
Hokage was still a young spring

177
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,143
chicken.

178
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,843
-The Hokage-- a spring chicken?

179
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,210
-That's right.

180
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,643
I was a young buck
myself back then.

181
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:03,276
-Young buck?

182
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:13,243
I, uh, got a little tangled up.

183
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:14,543
-What'd I tell you?

184
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:15,843
Those curses are no joke.

185
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:19,643
So wait a second.

186
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,176
If you studied
with Kakashi, that

187
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,310
means you must have gone
through the bell training.

188
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,310
Am I right?

189
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:25,010
-Huh?

190
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:25,843
Yeah.

191
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:26,743
I did.

192
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:27,610
Forgot about that.

193
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:38,943
Only I was tied to a stump.

194
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:41,343
Man, I forgot how
bad all that sucked.

195
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,210
-What?

196
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,710
You too, huh?

197
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,443
-Huh?

198
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:45,510
Me, too?

199
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,076
-Uh--

200
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,010
-Me too, what?

201
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,376
-Forget about it.

202
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,143
Just hurry up and put those
things back where you got 'em.

203
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,743
-Easier said than done.

204
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:53,443
I'm kinda-- tied up.

205
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,876
-There are two bells.

206
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,343
And since there are only two--

207
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:05,476
-One of us will get
tied to the stump.

208
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,543
-You're pretty quick on
the uptake, Orochimaru.

209
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:09,310
-All right!

210
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,943
I got this one in the bag.

211
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,176
-I want you to come at me
with the intent to kill.

212
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,243
-Well, Jiraiya, looks like
I win our little wager.

213
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:32,210
Enjoy your time on the stump.

214
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:35,810
-Aw, just shut up, you
flat chested cutting board.

215
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:37,676
-What did you say?

216
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,543
You annoying little perv!

217
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,076
-OK, that's enough,
enough, Tsunade.

218
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,076
You and Orochimaru head home.

219
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,543
-You're unbelievable,
you know that?

220
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,610
How can you be a ninja
if you keep falling

221
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:05,310
for the same obvious
traps over and over again?

222
00:13:05,343 --> 00:13:06,443
-Yeah, but--

223
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:09,010
-You could learn a few
things from Orochimaru.

224
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:11,076
-It's always the same
thing with you, Seinsei.

225
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,476
Orochimaru this and
Orochimaru that.

226
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,543
-Hm?

227
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:17,310
-The transparency
jutsu I use is flawless

228
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,910
when I'm out researching.

229
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:20,943
-Oh, boy.

230
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm not even sure I
want to know where

231
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,143
you are with transparency.

232
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:26,276
-I haven't been
caught peeping yet.

233
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,343
It's true, I swear!

234
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,343
-All right, then.

235
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,243
If you're so sure
of yourself, I'll,

236
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:33,943
uh, have to tag along next time.

237
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,543
-Wow, Sarutobi-sensei.

238
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:41,410
You're a perv.

239
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,376
[laughter]

240
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:44,876
-Huh?

241
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,310
Huh?

242
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:48,943
Hey, what is it?

243
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:49,943
Come on, spill it.

244
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,176
What's so funny, pervy sage?

245
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,376
-Huh?

246
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,343
Ah, you know, kid, just
what I was saying before.

247
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,943
A good teacher produces
good disciples.

248
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:57,810
-Huh?

249
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,510
What are you talking about?

250
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,243
-Just make sure
everything's back the way

251
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,576
it was, and let's go.

252
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,210
-Yeah, yeah.

253
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,176
I did it.

254
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:07,676
See?

255
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:27,076
-They're trouble.

256
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,643
But from the look of
things, it doesn't

257
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:30,543
appear they've found Naruto yet.

258
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:32,410
-That's what's crazy.

259
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,110
It doesn't add up.

260
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:37,643
I mean, they had already
infiltrated the village.

261
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:42,643
It should be easy for them
to find Naruto around here.

262
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:45,843
Besides, Itachi knows
Naruto's face already.

263
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,310
-Shh.

264
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:47,810
-Kakashi.

265
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,543
Why's Kakashi asleep?

266
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:57,710
And why is this
room full of Jonin?

267
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:58,943
What are you doing?

268
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:01,276
What the hell is going on here?

269
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,576
-Uh, not much, really.

270
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,543
-Hey!

271
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:05,576
Is it true that
Itachi has returned?

272
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:09,543
And that he's come
here to get Naruto?

273
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:16,843
-Idiot.

274
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,576
-Aw, why does this
always have to happen?

275
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:35,168
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): So he's
come back to the village, huh?

276
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,935
And he's after Naruto?

277
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,335
What does this mean?

278
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,168
[gasp]

279
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:49,901
-Hey, Sasuke.

280
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:51,468
-Where is Naruto?

281
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,301
-Well, I don't know.

282
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:53,868
I just got here myself.

283
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:57,268
I wanted to give
Naruto some-- sweets.

284
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:01,135
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): If Naruto
gets caught, he's dead.

285
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,101
I won't let that happen!

286
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:07,068
Old man, Naruto
stopped in here today.

287
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,568
Do you know where he
went after he left?

288
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,435
-Oh, sure.

289
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:11,735
Naruto.

290
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:14,068
That's right, let me see, now.

291
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:17,668
He met Master Jiraiya
here around noon.

292
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,401
They had a little
bit of ramen, then

293
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,135
they said they were
heading off somewhere.

294
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,668
-Where to?

295
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,101
-Hm.

296
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,501
Now that I think
of it, I believe

297
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,368
he mentioned that outpost town
a ways out from the village.

298
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,068
Yeah.

299
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:32,601
And then he set out
with Master Jiraiya.

300
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,935
-Jiraiya?

301
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:36,001
-Yeah, Jiraiya.

302
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,635
He's one of the
legendary Sannin.

303
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:40,501
Now, if you want
to find him, you're

304
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:42,201
looking for a
great big ol' fella

305
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,901
with a head of white hair.

306
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:45,635
-A big guy.

307
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:48,101
White hair.

308
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:48,835
-Hey!

309
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:50,368
Aw, come on.

310
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,435
If you're going to stop
by to ask some questions,

311
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,135
the least you can do
is order some ramen.

312
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,668
-Get your candy here!

313
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,501
-Hm.

314
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,035
Oh, man.

315
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,668
This town is pretty weird.

316
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:36,468
JIRAIYA: Naruto!

317
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,401
-Huh?

318
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,268
-We're gonna crash here tonight.

319
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:40,168
-What?

320
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:40,801
But why?

321
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:42,301
I can still walk.

322
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,901
-A disciple should
always obey his master.

323
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:47,601
-Look, I just want to
learn some jutsu, OK?

324
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,535
-Yeah, no kidding.

325
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,968
That's what makes
you a disciple.

326
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:50,435
Hm?

327
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:50,968
-Hm?

328
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:08,601
[giggling]

329
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:09,701
-Naruto!

330
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:14,201
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah!

331
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:15,568
Here's the room key.

332
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,435
I want you to go right up to
the room, train for a little,

333
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:20,368
work on your chakra,
then get to bed, OK?

334
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:22,668
-Oh, so I suppose
you're gonna tell me

335
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,668
it's time for the
grownups to play now.

336
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,368
Is that the vibe
here, you big perv?

337
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,568
-The outpost town
isn't that far off.

338
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:32,635
-Aw, man.

339
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:34,401
Every single time I'm
with that pervy sage,

340
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:35,735
I always end up getting shafted.

341
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:42,635
-This is it.

342
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,368
-Get your candy, here.

343
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,768
Get your candy!

344
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,335
-Guess I'll just have
to go door to door.

345
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:01,101
-Here's to you.

346
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:04,935
-Starting to think he has no
interest in training me at all.

347
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,435
[groaning]

348
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,101
-That one there, you like it?

349
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,068
-Mm-hm

350
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,001
-Hoo!

351
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,468
You see, 100 out of 100.

352
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,668
I never miss!

353
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,135
-Is there a dopey looking
blonde kid staying here?

354
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:24,968
About my age?

355
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,801
He's traveling with an old man.

356
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:28,135
A guy with white hair.

357
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,601
-I'm sorry, but this inn is
for women only, I'm afraid.

358
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:35,101
[grunting]

359
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:37,068
-Is there a goofy looking
blonde kid stay here?

360
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:38,101
Around my age?

361
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,468
With a big, white
haired old man?

362
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,101
-Actually, we only have
older guests here today.

363
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,268
-Mm.

364
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:50,135
This has got some
real zip to it, hm?

365
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:01,435
-Uh, guys, when did we decide
it was nap time in here?

366
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,168
-Is there a dopey
looking blonde kid

367
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,568
about my age staying here now?

368
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,468
He's traveling through the city
with a big guy with white hair.

369
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,068
-White hair, you say?

370
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,535
-Are they here?

371
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,168
-Hm.

372
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,335
Did I see someone like
that at the shift change?

373
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:16,135
I wonder.

374
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:17,768
-This is kind of a bitter drink.

375
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:18,901
Can you handle it?

376
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,435
OK, bottoms up!

377
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,601
-Oh, yeah!

378
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,501
A blonde kid and a
white haired old man.

379
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,668
-So they're here, then?

380
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,001
What room number?

381
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:29,135
-Let's see, now.

382
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:31,635
That would be room number
one on the second floor

383
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:32,768
at the end of the hall.

384
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:33,268
Huh?

385
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:44,068
[knocking]

386
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,968
[knocking]

387
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,501
-Ah, what now?

388
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:50,868
Are you telling me she
dumped you already?

389
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:51,768
[knocking]

390
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:55,335
-I heard you the first time!

391
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:56,735
OK, hold on.

392
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:59,701
Let me just unlock it.

393
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:00,201
-Naruto!

394
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:06,435
You're not--

395
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:31,696
[theme music]

396
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,363
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

397
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,496
My body is frozen.

398
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,696
I'm getting a bad feeling here.

399
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,696
There's something
about this guy.

400
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:11,663
He's not your average
shinobi, that's for sure.

401
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:15,563
He's got Sharingan,
Just like Sasuke.

402
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:18,463
That means he's from
the Uchiha clan.

403
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:21,296
Is this who Sasuke
was talking about?

404
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,463
Next time, Roar, Chidori!

405
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:26,129
Brother Versus Brother!
