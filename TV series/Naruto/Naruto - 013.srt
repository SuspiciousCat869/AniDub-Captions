00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:43,855
-Inari?

3
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,424
Could you give me a hand here?

4
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:46,391
Inari?

5
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:47,392
-I'll be right there!

6
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,580
-This mist-- Sasuke, Sakura.

7
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:07,213
Get ready.

8
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:14,889
I knew he was still alive.

9
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:17,925
He just couldn't
wait for round two.

10
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,996
-Kakashi-sensei, it's
Zabuza, isn't it?

11
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,898
This is his Hidden Mist jutsu.

12
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,907
ZABUZA: Sorry I kept
you waiting, Kakashi.

13
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,345
I see you've still got
those brats with you.

14
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,615
That one's still trembling.

15
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:39,215
Pitiful.

16
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,165
-I'm trembling with excitement.

17
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,433
-He's all yours, Sasuke.

18
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,683
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I can see it.

19
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:14,187
-Oh, so you could see they
were water clones, huh?

20
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:17,124
The brat's improving.

21
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:20,127
Looks like you've
got a rival, Haku.

22
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,094
-So it seems.

23
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:44,354
-I really hope I'm not too late.

24
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,404
-Well, well.

25
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:02,639
So I had it right.

26
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:05,009
It was all an act.

27
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,310
-An act?

28
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:07,712
-With a cute little mask.

29
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:08,646
-Huh?

30
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,248
-Big phony.

31
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,583
Ha.

32
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:14,653
-So I guess all that about
being a tracker ninja protecting

33
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,822
his village was just
a bunch of bull.

34
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,891
-They look pretty chummy to me.

35
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,559
I'd say they've
been pulling scams

36
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,595
like that for a long time.

37
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,798
-He's got some nerve,
facing us again

38
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,232
after pulling that tricks.

39
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,101
KAKASHI: And hiding
behind a mask.

40
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,069
Who does he think he's fooling?

41
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,673
SAKURA: Speak for
yourself, Sensei.

42
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:34,641
-That's it.

43
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,210
I'm taking him out.

44
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,244
[gasp]

45
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,314
-Who does he think
he's fooling, hiding

46
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:42,483
behind that mask like
some sort of clown?

47
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,220
-Sasuke, you're so cool.

48
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:46,788
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Wait a second.

49
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:48,724
Didn't I just say that?

50
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:51,793
She'll never change.

51
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,195
HAKU: He's impressive.

52
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,964
ZABUZA: Hmph.

53
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:57,299
-Even though they were
just 1/10 the strength

54
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:03,306
of the original water clone
jutsu, he did destroy them all.

55
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,276
-That move still gave
us the first advantage.

56
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,045
Now use it.

57
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,020
-Right.

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,317
-What's this?

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,599
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Haku's Secret Jutsu,

00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:28,567
Crystal Ice Mirrors.

61
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:42,683
-So you're Tazuna's
daughter, huh?

62
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:43,684
Too bad.

63
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,051
You'll have to come with us.

64
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:45,786
Now.

65
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:50,491
[scream]

66
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,535
-Mother!

67
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,403
-No!

68
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:02,237
Don't come out here!

69
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:02,705
Run away!

70
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,540
Hurry!

71
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,476
-Don't move.

72
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,079
-Should we grab this one, too?

73
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:10,914
-No.

74
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,216
Gato asked for just one hostage.

75
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,785
INARI (VOICEOVER): Hostage.

76
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,722
-All right.

77
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,923
Then let's waste him!

78
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:25,229
-Wait!

79
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,805
Please don't hurt my son.

80
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,605
I'm begging you.

81
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,440
He's just a boy.

82
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:44,016
I'll do anything.

83
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,484
Just please don't hurt him.

84
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:53,693
-Looks like your mom came
through for you, kid.

85
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:54,294
Lucky.

86
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,137
-What a waste.

87
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:05,406
I was in the mood
to cut something.

88
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,240
-Give it a rest.

89
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,743
You already drew blood today.

90
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,011
Let's get her out of here.

91
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:21,424
-I'm sorry, Mom!

92
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,325
I'm sorry!

93
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:27,530
What could I do?

94
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,365
I'm too weak to protect you.

95
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:37,942
I'm scared.

96
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:39,711
I don't wanna die!

97
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,114
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Coward!

98
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,286
Listen to yourself,
whining and complaining

99
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,488
like some sorry little victim.

100
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:53,592
You can whimper all
day for all I care.

101
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:56,128
You're just a coward!

102
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:59,966
-My guess is he just
got tired of crying

103
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,269
and decided to do
something about it.

104
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:08,308
He knows what it means to be
strong-- like your father did.

105
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:16,617
-If you really care about
something, protect it.

106
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:19,187
Even if you have to put
your life on the line.

107
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,689
Protect it with both arms.

108
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,264
-Inari.

109
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:42,712
-Can I-- can-- can I
be that strong, too?

110
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:50,254
Father.

111
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:54,993
[laughter]

112
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,928
-We're going to
treat you just fine,

113
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:59,564
so don't you worry your
pretty little head.

114
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:01,099
-Come on, keep walking.

115
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,635
INARI: Stop!

116
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,769
-Well, well.

117
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,038
If it ain't the
little tough guy.

118
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,007
-Inari!

119
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,041
-How cute.

120
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:11,276
You've come to save your mom.

121
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:14,814
-You'd better get
away from my mom!

122
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,781
-Inari!

123
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,383
No!

124
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:20,721
-This kid's a little short
on brains, don't you think?

125
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:21,922
-Take him down.

126
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:24,758
[shout]

127
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,129
-If you hurt him, I swear I'll--

128
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:29,063
-Shut up.

129
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,298
Take a nap.

130
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,601
-Inari--

131
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,170
[shout]

132
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:49,052
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): So, he can
keep up with Haku's speed, huh?

133
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,386
-Hm?

134
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:53,923
Sakura, cover Tazuna,
and stay close to me.

135
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,659
Let Sasuke handle this.

136
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,571
-We want the bridge
builder, not you.

137
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:11,042
If you back down, I
won't have to kill you.

138
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,044
-Save it.

139
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:15,380
-You're making a mistake.

140
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:19,017
You won't be able to
keep up with my speed.

141
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,089
I've gained two key advantages.

142
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,223
-Yeah?

143
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,125
What are they?

144
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:30,430
-First, we're
surrounded by water.

145
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,567
Second, I've blocked
one of your hands,

146
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:41,242
therefore you only have one
free hand to defend yourself.

147
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,276
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What?

148
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,777
Using one hand?

149
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,983
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Hand
signs with a single hand?

150
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:50,519
I've never seen that before.

151
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,726
-Secret Jutsu, 1,000
Needles Of Death.

152
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:03,933
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER): He
doesn't want to kill the kid?

153
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:04,935
Does he mean that?

154
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:08,504
-Sasuke!

155
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,979
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Remember the training.

156
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:15,579
Focus.

157
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,458
Summon my chakra at once.

158
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:46,012
-A substitution jutsu!

159
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:46,780
-The woman.

160
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:47,614
She's gone.

161
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,549
NARUTO: Sorry I'm a little late.

162
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,184
-Huh?

163
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,051
Who's that?

164
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,726
-You know, heroes usually
show up at the last minute.

165
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,861
-Naruto, it's you.

166
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,764
-Who else?

167
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:05,934
Inari, you did great.

168
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,503
-Huh?

169
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,038
-When you charged, they forgot
about your mom for a minute.

170
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:12,041
That gave me the chance to use
a cool jutsu to get her away

171
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:12,675
from them.

172
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,451
-Naruto, how did you know these
samurai guys were coming here?

173
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:26,123
-Uh, in the forest, I found a
boar that had been attacked,

174
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,125
and the trees were
all cut up, too,

175
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:31,762
like someone had been practicing
with a sword, or something.

176
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:37,502
The cuts led back toward the
house, so I followed them here.

177
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:39,304
-That was really smart.

178
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:40,705
-Blah, blah.

179
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,043
It's one of those puny
ninja brats Tazuna hired.

180
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:45,144
-Get him.

181
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:47,012
-Yeah.

182
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:47,747
-They're coming!

183
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:55,421
-Try something else!

184
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,193
-I did.

185
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,127
-I want him!

186
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:01,728
He's mine!

187
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,149
-You did it!

188
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,154
-Yeah!

189
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,322
Believe it!

190
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,858
-Huh?

191
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,359
That was so excellent.

192
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,362
Like a real ninja!

193
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,297
-You twerp.

194
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,431
I am a real ninja.

195
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,033
That's what I've
been telling you.

196
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,981
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Summon my chakra at once.

197
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,650
And direct it to my feet!

198
00:13:59,125 --> 00:13:59,892
HAKU: He vanished.

199
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,440
-You're not as
fast as you think.

200
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:16,209
From this point on,
you'll be the one

201
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,911
defending against my attacks.

202
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,965
ZABUZA (VOICEOVER):
It's not possible.

203
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:39,302
No one's faster than Haku.

204
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:41,371
-Thought you were quicker, huh?

205
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:44,440
Now, what else are
you wrong about?

206
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,943
-You made a big mistake
insulting these ninja

207
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,545
and calling them brats.

208
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,748
That's just guaranteed to
bring out Sasuke's attitude.

209
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:55,920
And he's the best young fighter
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

210
00:14:55,953 --> 00:15:00,758
And Sakura here is
our sharpest mind.

211
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,294
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Heh, heh, heh!

212
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:03,128
"Shya!"

213
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,697
Am I bad, or what?

214
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:08,767
-And last but not
least, our number one

215
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:12,104
hyperactive knucklehead
ninja is Naruto Uzumaki.

216
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,477
-Achoo!

217
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:20,547
-They say when you sneeze,
it's cause somebody's

218
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,781
talking about you somewhere.

219
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:23,983
-You don't believe that, do you?

220
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:27,087
Hey, by the way,
sorry about yesterday.

221
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:27,687
-Huh?

222
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,193
-Calling you a coward
was pretty mean, I guess.

223
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:34,995
Anyway, it's not true, you know?

224
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,501
Cause you are really brave.

225
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:41,770
[whimpering]

226
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:42,692
-Hm?

227
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,446
-Darn it!

228
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:53,716
I promised myself I
wouldn't cry anymore.

229
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,058
You're gonna make fun of me
again and call me a baby--

230
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:02,059
but I can't stop!

231
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,198
-What are you talking about?

232
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,502
-You're happy.

233
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:12,737
What's wrong with that?

234
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,107
-Huh?

235
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,081
-When you're happy,
it's okay to cry.

236
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,050
Really, it is.

237
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:25,651
-Naruto.

238
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,797
-OK!

239
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,167
I can leave you in charge
of things now, right?

240
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,003
-Yeah.

241
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,070
-Good!

242
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:46,140
Then I'm going
over to the bridge.

243
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,610
It's not easy being a hero.

244
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,077
It's tough.

245
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:50,978
Believe it!

246
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:51,946
-Believe it!

247
00:16:58,253 --> 00:16:59,788
[laughter]

248
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:05,361
-Haku, if we keep
going like this,

249
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,597
we'll be the victims
instead of them.

250
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:08,965
Get on with it.

251
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,059
-Right.

252
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:14,905
-What's that?

253
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,580
-I'm sorry it's come to this.

254
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:24,315
-The air-- so cold.

255
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:38,765
-Secret Jutsu.

256
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,919
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

257
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,163
-What is that?

258
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:09,164
How does it work?

259
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,157
-They're mirrors.

260
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,726
But how?

261
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:47,339
-If you enter this
fight, you fight me.

262
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:50,709
Your boy has no chance
against that jutsu.

263
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:51,444
He's finished.

264
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:59,118
-Now we'll begin.

265
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:02,756
And I'll show you what
speed really means.

266
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:08,924
-Sasuke!

267
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:15,971
-Sasuke!

268
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,663
-Just try to help him, and
I'll kill the other two

269
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:40,498
in a heartbeat.

270
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:51,409
-I'm sorry.

271
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:53,612
I can't stay with you.

272
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:56,448
Forgive me.

273
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,283
-I understand.

274
00:19:58,317 --> 00:19:58,951
Go now.

275
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:03,523
-Sakura--

276
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:04,490
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke!

277
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,029
-Take this!

278
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:28,516
He caught it!

279
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:45,702
Huh?

280
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:55,980
Who is it?

281
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:00,385
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What a fool.

282
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,352
Such a showoff.

283
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:08,259
-Number one hyperactive
knucklehead ninja.

284
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:29,249
-Naruto Uzumaki is here.

285
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:29,783
Yeah.

286
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:30,250
Believe it!

287
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:40,875
[theme music]

288
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,508
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Naruto Uzumaki is here.

289
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,443
Now everything will be OK.

290
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,279
Since I'm the hero,
I'll just smash

291
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:19,317
those messed up, weird looking
mirrors, and that'll be-- huh?

292
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,651
Why won't they break?

293
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,320
They're just made of ice.

294
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,888
Why won't they melt?

295
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:26,691
What the heck's going on?

296
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:30,014
-Next time, The Number One
Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja

297
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,814
Joins The Fight.

298
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,914
Will I kick butt again?

299
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,748
Or will I get my butt kicked?

300
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,281
What am I gonna do?
