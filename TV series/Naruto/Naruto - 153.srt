-I'll get you out.

3
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,274
Just hang on a little longer.

4
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,641
-Hey.

5
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,074
And just what do you
think you're doing?

6
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:52,607
-And one and two, one and two,
and one and two, one and-- I'm

7
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,207
sure they'll be all right.

8
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,174
They're clever and strong.

00:02:56,207 --> 00:03:00,107
They'll bring
Karashi back safely.

10
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:01,274
Sure they will.

11
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,874
No need to worry.

12
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,241
One, two.

The Katabami gold mine.

00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:19,474
You know, instead of just
rescuing Rokusuke and Karashi,

16
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:22,874
I say we finish off this
Kurosuki gang once and for all.

17
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:25,641
-Let's not get
carried away, Naruto.

18
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:28,074
-OK, so what's the
plan then, genius?

19
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,241
-Remember what Guy-sensei said.

20
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,674
That worries me.

21
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:32,607
-What about it?

22
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:33,807
That the boss of
the gang might be

23
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:36,107
one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsman of the Mist?

24
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,941
If you ask me, that just
makes it more interesting.

25
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:40,674
-I don't know, we
can't really be sure

26
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:44,174
that Guy-sensei was
right about that anyway.

-What are you talking about?

28
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,874
Guy-sensei is always right.

30
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:50,907
We need to investigate.

-Sir Raiga.

34
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:14,974
We caught one of
the three villagers

35
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,174
who tried to run away.

36

-Well done.

37
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,474
-Seems they thought
they'd run and get help

38
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,707
from the ninja of the
neighboring village.

-Yes sir.

00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:45,041
-Why, Rokusuke?

think so little of us

that you'd leave us like
that, without a word.

-Personally, I find
funerals very comforting.

People can be so cruel.

their living things

betraying each other,

envying and hating each other.

78
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:47,007
There's nothing like a funeral
to bring people together.

79
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,741
To make them forget
their differences

and remember the good times.

81

People are at their
best at funerals.

-Is that stuff gold?

100
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,074
Doesn't look like much.

101
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,007
LEE: The gold is just
a part of the ore.

102
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,541
It must be melted and refined,
and the mercury and impurities

103
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:55,307
removed.

104
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,874
-Sounds like a lot of work.

105
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:57,874
-Don't worry.

106
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,441
You don't have to understand it.

107
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:12,174
-What do you think
you're doing, old man?

108
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:12,841
Get up!

109
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,141
-On your feet.

110
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:17,874
Or do we tell the boss it's
time for another funeral?

111
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:18,507
-No.

112
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,374
Please.

113

Ugh.

115
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:22,607
OK, that does it!

116
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,707
Now I'm mad!

117
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,241
-Relax, Naruto.

118

-Yeah.

121

Hold your horses.

-Great idea.

Let's just set here and
watch him drive that old man

You just leave this to me.

What are you doing?

-That's right.

131
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:42,574
Pick them up.

132
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:43,441
Every one of them.

133
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:49,741
-Huh?

134
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,474
-Way to go, Lee!

135
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:02,607
-You are all right.

136
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,241
Fear not.

137
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,074
-Are you crazy?

138
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:09,841
Dear heaven, what have you done?

139
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:10,507
-Here.

140
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,141
You must be thirsty.

141
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:13,841
NARUTO: Hey!

142
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,974
What's that all about?

143
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,741
-You've got to do to me,
just what you did to them.

144
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,374
Hurry!

145
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:19,974
Beat me!

146
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:20,674
Hit me!

147
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:22,474
Knock me to the ground!

148
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,141
-You feeling OK?

149
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:28,574
-If you won't, then
I'll do it myself.

150
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,407
-No, stop that.

151
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,874
-What the heck's wrong with you?

152
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,341
-Don't you see?

153
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:34,574
If I'm not injured, they'll
think I was behind it,

154
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,174
and that means they'll
give me a funeral.

155
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,807
-That gong.

156
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,641
What does it mean?

157
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:48,707
-Is it some kind of alarm?

158
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:49,907
-No.

159
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,974
It's summoning
everyone to a funeral.

160
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,741
-A funeral?

161
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:56,707
-That's right.

162
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:59,974
If any of us displeases
Raiga, the leader of the clan,

163
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,141
then as punishment,
he arranges a funeral

164
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,807
in which the guilty
person is buried alive.

165
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:05,441
-He what?

166
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:06,774
Buries them alive?

167
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,307
That's the worst
thing I've ever heard!

168
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,874
-Then Raiga gets very sad.

169
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:13,974
He bows his head and
weeps over the coffin

170
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,307
as if he's lost a dear friend.

171
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:19,474
-Sounds like we're dealing
with a real nutjob here.

172
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:20,507
-That gong.

173
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,841
Whose funeral are
they ringing it for?

174
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:24,741
It can't be yours,
can it, old man?

175
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:25,941
-No.

176
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,507
I heard they caught
Rokusuke this morning.

177
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,874
It must be his.

178
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:30,374
-Rokusuke?

179
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,574
-I remember the first
day I met Rokusuke.

180
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:12,274
It's a happy memory.

181
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,574
-Is it?

182
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,174
That's nice.

183
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,574
-Yes.

184
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:19,107
I still see the smile
on his simple face

185
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:22,907
when he learned we were
taking over the gold mine.

186
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:27,274
When we told him the days
of cruel taxes were over.

187
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,207
How happy he was.

188
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,041
Almost dancing for joy.

189
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:35,941
That's how I'll
always remember him.

190
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:38,007
I like funerals.

191
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,707
They're so nostalgic.

192
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,374
-Will you have a nice
funeral for me, too?

193
00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:44,441
-Don't talk nonsense.

194
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,374
There will be no
funeral for you--

195
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:49,441
because you're not going to die.

196
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,441
Besides, I don't need
a funeral to remind me

197
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:52,907
of the good times we've shared.

198
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,907
You've always been a good boy.

199
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,407
-Raiga.

200
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:02,907
-Hm?

201
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,974
-They're coming.

202
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:07,574
They'll be here very soon now.

203
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:08,707
-Good.

204
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:12,074
I'm curious to see who
he found to rescue him.

205
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,707
-OK, what are we waiting for?

206
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,241
Let's save this guy.

207
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,874
What do you say, Neji?

208
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:23,174
-All right.

209
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:23,674
Byakuran!

210
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,107
It's all right.

211
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,107
He's still alive.

212
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:39,407
We'll draw the guards
away, and then get him out.

213
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,407
-OK.

214
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,974
We hit him fast,
and we hit him hard.

215
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:43,807
-All right.

216
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:45,399
Time to begin.

217
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,053
[banging]

218
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,053
-Please!

219
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:06,519
Let me out of here!

220
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:09,019
Let me out!

221
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,986
[laughter]

222
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:21,786
-We're under attack!

223
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:30,186
[shout]

224
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,186
-Get ready!

225
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:32,153
-Tenten!

226
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,686
Take care of those
two on the right.

227
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,653
-I got 'em!

228
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:47,853
-Gentle Fist!

229
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,919
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

230
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:06,686
Uzumaki Barrage!

231
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,419
Someone ought to bury you now.

232
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:17,286
-Watch out.

233
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,153
-Huh?

234
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:19,553
-There are three more of them.

235
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,019
-Do not forget that handsome
devil, Rock Lee of the Leaf.

236
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:32,386
I've found the last one.

237
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:32,886
-No!

238
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,386
No!

239
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,686
-Is it really you?

240
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,586
-What is it?

241
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:43,986
Who is this guy?

242
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,986
-He is-- this is Karashi.

243
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,286
-He's the one Grandma
Sansho told us about?

244
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,419
-This guy's Karashi?

245
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:59,986
-Karashi, is it true
what Grandma Sansho said?

246
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,353
You chose to join
the Kurosuki clan?

247
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,019
-Well, so what if I did?

248
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,253
What of it?

249
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:05,919
-What of it?

250
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,186
-Sure I did.

251
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,119
Their leader is a great man.

252
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:11,653
He took the entire gold mine
back from those evil men,

253
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:15,553
and he liberated
this whole village.

254
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:22,119
-And one, and two, and one
and two, and one and two,

255
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,219
and one and two.

256
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:26,019
-Excuse me.

257
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:27,019
Grandma?

258
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:27,819
-Unbelievable!

259
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:29,586
Are you really that greedy?

260
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,886
Shame on you.

261
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,253
Those people are out there
risking their lives for us.

262
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,153
And all you can think
about is your stomach.

263
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:38,019
Well, you'll just have
to wait, you hear?

264
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:38,953
-That's not it.

265
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:41,019
I don't mind
waiting, it's just--

266
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,819
I think something's burning.

267
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:44,253
-Huh?

268
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:44,753
-Oh!

269
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:46,953
No, no!

270
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,786
You're right, I burned it.

271
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:52,019
Never done that before.

272
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,519
NARUTO: How can
you do this to her?

273
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:55,853
That poor old woman
worries about you all day

274
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:58,519
long while she stands
there cooking that curry.

275
00:14:58,553 --> 00:14:59,719
You ungrateful little--

276
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:00,819
-Wait, Naruto.

277
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:04,353
Perhaps it would be
better if I handle it.

278
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:07,319
Karashi, that was more
than just a delicious

279
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:08,519
curry you used to make.

280
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,386
It literally saved my life.

281
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,986
You have a gift.

282
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,886
You would give that up
to join these people,

283
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,953
who do not even care
about human life?

284
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,786
How can you?

285
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,153
-What did I ever
get for sweating

286
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,953
over that stupid pot all day?

287
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,253
Nothing.

288
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:26,519
Joining the Kurosuki, I became
part of something bigger.

289
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,353
Something powerful and feared.

290
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,819
I'm important now.

291
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:31,486
Not some nobody
stuck in the kitchen

292
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,919
of a stinking little curry shop.

293
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:34,686
-I've had it with this guy.

294
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,253
He's never going to
listen to reason!

295
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:40,553
Huh?

296
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,919
-Lee.

297
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:48,619
-Karashi.

298
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:50,519
Not only did you bring
me back from the brink

299
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:52,386
of death with your
curry, but you taught me

300
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,386
a lesson I have never forgotten.

301
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,486
You taught me that if you
put your heart and soul

302
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,086
into something,
anything can happen.

303
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,319
You can change the world.

304
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:03,086
I learned that even someone
like me could accomplish

305
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,353
great things if I
tried hard enough.

306
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,753
That was your gift.

307
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:11,786
You say you want to be more
powerful and respected?

308
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,253
You were a better man then.

309
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:28,786
-Karashi.

310
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,619
-I've never seen
anyone work so hard.

311
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,153
-I see.

312
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:39,219
So you want to help this
young man as well, eh?

313
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,019
-Turn back, Karashi.

314
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,853
You must turn away from
this path you have taken.

315
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,386
Be the man you once were.

316
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,386
-You're right.

317
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,253
I've been a fool.

318
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,519
Forgive me.

319
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:08,386
-Good.

320
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:09,919
Glad to have you back on board.

321
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:11,753
[banging]

322
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:13,719
ROKUSUKE: Please, someone
get me out of here!

323
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,653
It's dark!

324
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,153
NARUTO: Oh, man!

325
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:18,153
It's Rokusuke.

326
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,153
The poor guy, we
forgot all about him!

327
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,419
-It's-- it's yu.

328
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:29,186
-That's all.

329
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,819
Sorry to keep you waiting.

330
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,019
-Forgive me.

331
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,219
But when I thought of
my friend buried alive,

332
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,886
I had to try to help.

333
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,886
I couldn't just stand
by and do nothing.

334
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,853
-Yeah.

335
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:42,386
I know exactly how you feel.

336
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:46,553
-Neji.

337
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:47,219
What is it?

338
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,086
-What is this feeling?

339
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,719
This sudden sense of danger?

340
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,486
-What's wrong, Neji?

341
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,019
What is it?

342
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,653
-We're being watched.

343
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:12,419
I think it's Raiga.

344
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:13,353
NARUTO: Where?

345
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,219
NEJI: From the
top of that cliff.

346
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:15,853
NARUTO: Good.

347
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,419
Let's go get him.

348
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:21,053
-Karashi, you stay here
and look after Rokusuke.

349
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:21,553
-All right.

350
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,219
-Wait.

351
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:32,619
There's no one here.

352
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,619
-Are you sure about that?

353
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:40,619
What's goin' on?

354
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:49,586
-An impenetrable mist.

355
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,486
[laughter]

356
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,486
-Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Justsu.

357
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,853
-Here it is.

358
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:02,419
The Hidden Mist Jutsu is the
trademark of the Mist Village

359
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,453
nina.

360
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,319
-The Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist.

361
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,753
Guy-sensei was right.

362
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:07,719
-Fine.

363
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:09,219
I just wish I could
see something.

364
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:12,153
-Neji, try employing
your Byakugan.

365
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,553
-Don't you think
I've been trying?

366
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,419
No use.

367
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,253
I can't see a thing.

368
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:26,719
-Incredible.

369
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:30,653
So, even the all-seeing
Byakugan is blind in this mist?

370
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:33,553
This jutsu is very powerful.

371
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,053
-You really can't see anything?

372
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:38,553
-I've never heard of any jutsu
stronger than the Byakugan.

373
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:55,953
-Well, Ranmaru,
what do you think?

374
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,319
RANMARU: It's amazing.

375
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:59,153
One of them has
eyes with the power

376
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,153
to actually see
the chakra network.

377
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:05,519
He must possess
the Kekkai Genkai.

378
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,453
-You mean he can see us?

379
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,386
-No, don't worry.

380
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,919
My powers are still
greater than his.

381
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,519
So, what will you do?

382
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:17,553
-I carry the burden of all the
hopes and fears of everybody

383
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:20,986
who works in the
Katabami gold mine.

384
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,653
The people depend on
me to keep the village

385
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,386
safe from intruders.

386
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,353
-Will you arrange a funeral?

387
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,519
-For them?

388
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:30,019
They're strangers to me.

389
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:33,919
A funeral for them would
summon no happy memories.

390
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:35,386
No.

391
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:37,553
I'll simply kill them.

392
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,986
-Behold.

393
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,419
Ninja Art, Lightning Fang!

394
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,153
-Now what's going on?

395
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:01,553
-Lightning Fang,
Strike them down!

396
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,286
How was that, Ranmaru?

397
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,719
-Wonderful, Raiga.

398
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:19,219

NARUTO: Naruto Uzumaki Barrage!

401
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:04,738
What the--

402
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,804
ROCK LEE: Leaf Hurricane!

403
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:08,738
TENTEN: I've got you!

404
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:09,771
NEJI: This is impossible.

405
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:10,971
NARUTO: He's vanished!

406
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:12,238
ROCK LEE: Where is the enemy?

407
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:13,138
TENTEN: What enemy?

408
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:14,338
There is no enemy,

409
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:16,304
-Neji, you sure you got
that Byakugan working right?

410
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:18,138
NEJI: Quiet, Naruto.

411
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:19,904
Of course it's working.

412
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:21,238
He's here somewhere.

413
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:22,604
He must be.

414
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:24,438
I can see his chakra.

415
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,671
NARUTO: Next time, The
Enemy of the Byakugan!
