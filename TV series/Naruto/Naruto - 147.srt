00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,104
-His level of chakra
is unbelievable.

3
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:04,204
It's so much that
my skin is crawling.

4
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,004
-I feel the same
thing in my nose.

5
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:09,370
-Mizuki.

6
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,037
-What's the matter?

7
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,670
Too chicken to make a move?

8
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,437
-Oh, yeah?

9
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,637
-Naruto, hold on!

10
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,137
Stay back!

11
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:27,070
-He is stupid.

12
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:33,470
-Naruto, you OK?

13
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:36,470
-If I were in your shoes, I'd
be more worried about myself.

IRUKA (VOICEOVER): He's fast.

15
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,304
And he's so strong.

MIZUKI: This must be the power
Lord Orochimaru promised.

18
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,404
I've become unstoppable.

19
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,637
I almost scare myself.

20
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,604
Well, aren't you impressed?

21
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,770
Mizuki, please stop.

22
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:07,604
Don't do this.

23
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:08,904
I beg you.

24
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,704
-Tsubaki, don't!

25
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,770
-I don't care what
might happen to me.

26
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:18,737
I'm begging you,
you have to stop now

27
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,670
before you take this too far.

28
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,170
Please, Mizuki.

29
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,270
Come home to the village.

30
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:30,104
-Tsubaki, I'm touched.

31
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:32,937
But if you truly care that
much about helping me,

32
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,737
why don't you be useful
and get out of my way?

33
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,737
-Oh, no.

34
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,237
Tsubaki!

35
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:45,104
-What?

36
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:45,904
-You're too slow.

37
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:52,437
-Iruka sensei!

38
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:57,304
Take this Shadow Clone Jutsu!

39
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:03,570
-Still using the same
boring attack, huh?

40
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:06,404
You sure haven't
gotten any better.

41
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:07,904
-He vanished!

42
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:08,570
-No, wait.

43
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:09,404
He didn't vanish.

44
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,270
He just moves really quickly.

45
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,270
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): He's
accelerating and moving

46
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:14,537
into our blind spots.

47
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,870
In that case-- everybody!

48
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,837
We need to watch every
inch of this forest!

50
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,704
-I see what he's up to.

51
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:35,537
Even an idiot gets a
bright idea now and then.

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,637
It doesn't matter.

53
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,370
If you're smart enough
to think that up,

54
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,337
maybe you're smart
enough to know

55
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,070
how much you're gonna suffer!

56
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:43,737
-Here he is!

57
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,670
-I knew I spotted him!

58
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:47,037
-You didn't spot me, boy.

59
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,004
You only saw me 'cause
I wanted you to.

60
00:04:58,404 --> 00:04:59,370
-I got ya now!

61
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:06,904
No way.

62
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,870
I can see him, but I
still can't hit him.

63
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:09,770
-It's no trick.

64
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm not predicting your attacks.

65
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:14,070
You just move so
slow, it's easy.

66
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,304
-Huh?

67
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,804
MIZUKI: Hey, you had it coming.

68
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:28,304
Stupid demon fox.

69
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,270
Come on.

70
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,204
You can't just give
up that quickly.

71
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,170
I want you to taste
the same agony

72
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:43,337
I've endure for years and years.

73
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,870
The fun's just starting.

74
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:46,570
Right, Naruto?

75
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:49,337
There's still much
more enjoyment to come.

76
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,237
Like this.

77
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,137
[naruto yelling]

78
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,104
-Stop it, Mizuki.

79
00:05:58,137 --> 00:05:59,804
Don't you lay
another hand on him.

80
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,270
-Stay out of this, Iruka!

81
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:04,337
Do you have any
idea how long I've

82
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,537
been waiting for this
moment to arrive?

83
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,270
I've been yearning for this
ever since the day I first

84
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:13,837
met you-- to finally
take my revenge.

85
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,970
With my new power, I'm going
to savor destroying you both.

86
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,270
Stand up and watch, Iruka.

87
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:23,970
I'm going to start
with your friend.

88
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:25,170
-Mizuki--

89
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:26,970
-Now, there you go.

90
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,637
Good job.

91
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,537
-Let's do it.

92
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:33,937
-Come on!

93
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,704
That was pathetic.

94
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,837
You're so not even in
the same league as me.

95
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,470
Fate has made my body
into the ultimate weapon,

96
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,970
and now, I finally
get to obliterate you.

97
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:49,670
-What are you talking
about, the ultimate weapon?

98
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:52,537
When all your power depends
on some unnatural potion,

99
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,404
it's not true power.

100
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:55,504
-That's so like you.

101
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,204
Always acting better than me.

102
00:06:58,237 --> 00:06:59,504
Go ahead.

103
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:04,304
Try and beat me using that
true power you love so much!

104
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,704
You'll never be like me.

105
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:10,004
All your life, you've just
been some insignificant teacher

106
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:14,370
who allows your own village
to use you like a puny pawn.

107
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,037
You're jealous of
the way I live.

108
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,837
I know you want m power.

109
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,437
But even if you
practiced for 100 years,

110
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,370
you'd never be able to learn it.

111
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,670
This is only the
beginning of my wrath.

112
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:32,504
I'm going to get even
stronger than this.

113
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:36,470
Soon, Orochimaru will share
his hidden jutsu with me.

114
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:41,137
-You don't honestly believe
that's gonna happen?

115
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,904
-I'm getting tired of you
acting like you know everything.

116
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:48,370
I think it's time to
end all this-- just

117
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,637
like old times,
only this time, I'm

118
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,637
gonna finish you off
once and for all.

119
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,570
Ready to say goodbye?

120
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,704
-Naruto, why?

121
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,737
-Mizuki, don't you lay
another hand on my sensei!

122
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:29,704
-This is all so perfect.

123
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:32,837
Nothing ever changes, not even
down to the smallest detail.

124
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:39,770
One exception-- I'm much
different this time.

125
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:43,337
The only reason I was
defeated in our last meeting

126
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,037
was because I underestimated
that conniving demon fox.

127
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:01,770
-What is he turning into?

128
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,470
-I won't let my
guard down again.

129
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:07,870
I'm calling on all my
strength to crush you.

130
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:10,204
Now, let's all
have some real fun.

131
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,162
-Sorry, guys.

132
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,229
I can't hold on.

133
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:27,162
-Choji!

134
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:34,429
Great.

135
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:35,662
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
If only I knew

136
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,662
I little more information
about these behemoths.

137
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:45,529
-Big bro, my body
feels much lighter now.

138
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:47,229
-Yeah, same here.

139
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,629
Almost weightless, huh, Raijin?

140
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:50,462
-OK.

141
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:51,762
Time to do us some clobbering.

142
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:52,429
-Right on.

143
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:53,229
Time for clobbering.

144
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:02,729
-Oh, come on.

145
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,396
[grunting]

146
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,796
-What the heck is this?

147
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,496
My body is frozen.

148
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,796
-I can't even move an inch.

149
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:18,629
-What?

150
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:21,229
Paralysis genjutsu.

151
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,029
TSUNADE: Looks like I
made it just in time.

152
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:25,162
-Huh?

153
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:26,429
You held them long enough.

154
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:29,396
Good work, Shikamaru,
Ino, Choji.

155
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,496
Now, leave the rest to me.

156
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,662
-The-- Fifth Hokage?

157
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,062
-I don't believe it.

158
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:37,696
Lady Hokage showed up in person?

159
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:38,562
-Lady Tsunade?

160
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,929
-I'm sorry I found out
about this so late.

161
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:50,329
But I wouldn't have imagined
these two morons were somehow

162
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:51,196
involved with Mizuki.

163
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:52,629
-Man, the Hokage.

164
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,662
-Thank goodness she's here.

165
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,496
-I can't move.

166
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,962
-Well, well.

167
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,462
Fujin and Raijin.

168
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:10,396
We run into each other in the
darnedest of places, don't we?

169
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,362
-Yeah.

170
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:12,862
-Uh, hi.

171
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,862
How you been, Tsunade?

172
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,596
-I hope you have
a good explanation

173
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:17,996
for what you're doing here.

174
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:28,696
-She's so strong.

175
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,229
-More like she's so scary.

176
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:32,462
-Now, then.

177
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:35,229
Isn't there something
you should say?

178
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,362
-We're sorry.

179
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,096
We're sorry.

180
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,296
-Please forgive us.

181
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,196
We won't do it again.

182
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,796
TSUNADE: You're telling
me the only reason

183
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,496
you obeyed Mizuki was
because he promised you

184
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,162
that there was a feast
waiting at Orochimaru's place?

185
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,096
FUJIN AND RAIJIN: Yeah.

186
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,696
We're so sorry.

187
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,529
-We had no chance
against those two.

188
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,429
They're such high level ninja.

189
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:57,562
-I wonder what happened
to make those oafs so

190
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:59,096
scared of Tsunade.

191
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,962
-I don't even want to imagine
what she might have done.

192
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,162
-Come on.

193
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:06,596
Even you two shouldn't
fall for such obvious bait.

194
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:07,796
OK, everybody.

195
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,296
Mizuki's heading up
into those mountains.

196
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,996
Naruto and Iruka are
probably with him.

197
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,862
You three rest up a
bit, and then we'll

198
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,062
get going after them.

199
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:16,896
-But wait.

200
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,762
Aren't you forgetting something?

201
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,496
I mean, what are we
going to do with them?

202
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,696
-Oh, you don't need to
worry about them anymore.

203
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,362
They know what'll
happen to them if they

204
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,596
cause us any more trouble.

205
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,762
I've decided to let them
go home on their own.

206
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:35,062
Now, Fujin, Raijin--
to be 100% clear,

207
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:37,296
if you are one minute
later, you get no dinner.

208
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,929
-Yes, ma'am.

209
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:40,829
-Come on, bro.

210
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,562
We can't just stand here.

211
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,062
Let's hurry back to prison
before we're too late.

212
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,129
-We gotta get back for dinner.

213
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:49,429
Dinner!

214
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:49,929
Dinner!

215
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:50,429
Dinner!

216
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:51,329
Dinner!

217
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,196
Dinner!

218
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:54,496
-Amazing.

219
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:56,729
Those guys sure can hustle.

220
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,596
-Well, if a person doesn't get
a proper dinner, he could die.

221
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,929
-Um, that's only
true for you, Choji.

222
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:13,829
-I don't get it.

223
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:16,129
His force is even greater
than it was earlier.

224
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:23,996
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I can't
let him take me down like this.

225
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,796
After all, he may have a
clue about where Sasuke is.

226
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:29,296
-Naruto.

227
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,896
-Iruka, are you going
to be all right?

228
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,196
-Yeah.

229
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,696
-Hey, did you notice
what I noticed?

230
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,329
-What are you talking about?

231
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:36,796
-He's slowing down.

232
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,129
That jerk's power level
has increased tenfold,

233
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,796
but his movements are
getting sluggish and slow.

234
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,296
-You think he
transferred the chakra

235
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:46,362
he was using for speed to power?

236
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:48,096
-I don't know, but
something's different.

237
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:53,729
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): Naruto
can't last much longer alone.

238
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,996
But if Mizuki's
speed has dropped,

239
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,296
I might be able to
take advantage of it.

240
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,362
All right.

241
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:02,262
Just hang in there a
little more, Naruto.

242
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:03,862
-Are you impressed,
you little brat?

243
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:08,896
Do you appreciate the body
Lord Orochimaru gave me yet?

244
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,596
I'll tear you apart
with my bare hands.

245
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:17,329
-You-- you should just tell
me where I can find him.

246
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,629
Where's Orochimaru hiding?

247
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,629
I'm not gonna ask again.

248
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,796
-And why would I give a little
runt like you that information?

249
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,529
-Well, he sure wasn't in
the Hidden Sound Village.

250
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,996
-How would you know that?

251
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,229
Did you go to the
Hidden Sound Village?

252
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:34,862
-The compound was
already completely empty.

253
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:39,529
And Sasuke and Orochimaru
weren't there anymore.

254
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:43,162
-You must have really given
that one a lot of thought, huh?

255
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,396
I don't know where you heard
about the Village Hidden

256
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:46,562
the Sound.

257
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,229
But if you're trying
to throw me off

258
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,129
by telling me some stupid
bluff, it's not gonna happen.

259
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,562
I'm too smart.

260
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:54,762
You're gonna meet your maker.

261
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,396
Listen to me.

262
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,762
Don't you ever lie to
me like that again.

263
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,762
-Naruto, this way, fast!

264
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,129
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Iruka sensei.

265
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:24,429
-Ha ha!

266
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:26,762
If you're so great,
why can't you catch me?

267
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:27,262
You

268
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:27,929
-Coward.

269
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:28,796
You won't get away.

270
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:29,296
No!

271
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:36,696
-OK.

272
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,962
Jump now, Naruto!

273
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:38,896
-All right!

274
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:43,762
-Huh?

275
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:44,262
No.

276
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,662
This is--

277
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,096
-Seal and capture perimeter.

278
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,096
-No!

279
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,596
Capture and arrest jutsu?

280
00:15:57,596 --> 00:15:58,996
-[inaudible]!

281
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,296
-Amazing.

282
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:10,362
That jutsu is-- he learned
the fourth Hokage's jutsu.

283
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:16,262
That jutsu is-- he learned
the fourth Hokage's jutsu.

284
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,029
That was Rasengan.

285
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:23,696
-Hey, you all
right, Iruka sensei?

286
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:25,629
-Naruto, that was fantastic.

287
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:27,062
What an incredible job.

288
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,062
NARUTO: Sensei,
this guy didn't know

289
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:31,162
the Hidden Sound
Village was abandoned.

290
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,662
So that makes me think he's
not really with Orochimaru.

291
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,496
-More of your filthy lies.

292
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,129
-Mizuki.

293
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:42,629
-I don't understand.

294
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:46,262
This is the ultimate body
given to me by Lord Orochimaru.

295
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,996
I'll go to the
Hidden Sound Village

296
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,829
and he will-- [vomiting]

297
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:52,662
-Iruka sensei, what's going on?

298
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,996
TSUNADE: It's just
as I suspected.

299
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:56,629
-Grandma Tsunade!

300
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:58,729
-Lady Hokage?

301
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:02,062
-His body's cellular
structure is disintegrating.

302
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:04,962
-You little bast-- what
have you done to me?

303
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,862
-It's not Naruto's fault.

304
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:09,662
This is caused by
the formula you took.

305
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,462
-What?

306
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,096
That's impossible.

307
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,996
-You're getting a taste
of your own medicine.

308
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,296
You see, that potion
wasn't fully developed yet.

309
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:24,129
-The last prisoner has
been recaptured, ma'am.

310
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,262
And we looked after Shizune.

311
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,662
She was injured quite badly, but
there's no threat to her life.

312
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:30,629
-I see.

313
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,029
Thanks for your hard work.

314
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,962
-That's good news, huh?

315
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:37,429
It's nice to hear
Shizune's gonna be OK.

316
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:39,829
TSUNADE: Orochimaru probably
discovered that potion

317
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,696
by accident while he
was trying to develop

318
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,362
some other illegal jutsu.

319
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,329
All we know is
that that substance

320
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:49,096
absorbs the DNA of
animals and combines it

321
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:50,962
with the human genome.

322
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:53,929
It draws huge primal
power out of the body,

323
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:56,729
but it only lasts a short while.

324
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:59,396
As it works, it puts
an incredible strain

325
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,629
on host' body cells--
stress that far exceeds

326
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:05,662
the limits of the human body.

327
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:10,062
It's too dangerous
for anyone to use.

328
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:12,529
IRUKA: But why would
Mizuki do that?

329
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:15,162
-I don't know all the
details of his involvement.

330
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:18,496
It's safe to assume Mizuki and
Orochimaru had joined forces

331
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:19,629
at some point.

332
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:20,829
However--

333
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:22,729
IRUKA: Now that bond is broken.

334
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:24,096
-Yes.

335
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,896
Sadly for Mizuki, Orochimaru
only used him as a play thing.

336
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:30,696
It was all a joke to him,
letting his ally march off

337
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:33,062
with some useless potion.

338
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:36,329
But Mizuki is one lucky guy.

339
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:40,062
An average shinobi would
have certainly lost his life.

340
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:42,596
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Although,
he'll never be a shinobi again.

341
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:47,829
-It's all pretty
unfortunate, isn't it?

342
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,462
-Actually, I kind
of had a feeling

343
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,196
it was gonna end this way.

344
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,429
-Did you really?

345
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,629
-But I can't quit
after one setback.

346
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:57,429
I'm gonna keep searching for
clues until I can find Sasuke.

347
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,496
-Tsubaki, I--

348
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:04,996
-Don't you dare pity me, Iruka.

349
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:06,796
-You shouldn't speak.

350
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,429
Next time we meet, I
promise I'll take you down,

351
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,029
and the little squirt, too.

352
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,362
-I'm sorry, but there's no way.

353
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,562
While you were pursuing
your selfish dream,

354
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,529
Naruto's been at work
honing his ninja skills.

355
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:23,696
There's no way you can
catch up with him now.

356
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,729
-Mizuki can never go back
to being a shinobi again.

357
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,429
-And you, Tsubaki?

358
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:32,162
-I'm thinking about
starting a new life as well.

359
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:34,529
But before that, I
must atone for all

360
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:38,296
of the trouble I
caused the village.

361
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,262
-Ah, what a beautiful sunset.

362
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:44,962
Well, let's get
back to the village.

363
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,096
-I don't give up.

364
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,296
I can't give up.

365
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:08,796
Hey, I did it!

366
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,029
-All right.

367
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,662
Since you all did such
a terrific job today,

368
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,862
I'm gonna treat you guys to
a meal at Ichiraku Ramen.

369
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,296
-No way!

370
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,696
You're so awesome, Iruka sensei!

371
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,996
-I want a big slice
of barbecued pork.

372
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,196
-I want all three kinds of ramen
noodles-- butter, soy sauce,

373
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,262
and miso.

374
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,162
-Hold on, Iruka.

375
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,629
Before that, you
need to get Naruto

376
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:36,196
to Leaf Village Hospital.

377
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:36,896
-Why?

378
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,129
I told you I feel OK.

379
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:41,029
-Don't argue with me.

380
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:42,562
SAKURA: Lady Tsunade!

381
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:45,029
-Hm?

382
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,496
-I did it!

383
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,996
I mastered the first level!

384
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:53,329
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

385
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:56,462
Her training only just began.

386
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:59,962
Could should be a genius
and surpass Shizune?

387
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:01,396
-Hey!

388
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:02,596
Sakura, over here!

389
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,896
IRUKA (VOICEOVER): I guess
you saved me this time around.

390
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,829
Naruto-- who knows how
strong he'll become?

391
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,734
[theme music]

392
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:03,868
-I can't take it anymore.

393
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,501
How am I supposed
to figure out where

394
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,234
Sasuke is if I'm
just sitting around?

395
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:09,734
And Grandma Tsunade's
telling me I

396
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:12,234
can't make any moves on my own.

397
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:15,668
If things keep going like
this, we'll never find Sasuke.

398
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:17,101
Come on, think.

399
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,968
There's gotta be something--
some small chance,

400
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,834
anything that'll
lead us to Sasuke.

401
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:26,368
Next time-- the Search for
the Rare Bikochu Beetle.
