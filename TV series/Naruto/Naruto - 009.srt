So you passed the clone

Smart.

--[laughs] I knew I couldn't
beat him with my shadow clones.

That was just to distract him.

59
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,989
While he fought the clones,
I turned into the demon wind

60
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:56,957
shuriken.

61
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,992
He didn't know what to do.

62
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:58,792
Believe it.

63
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,682
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
used one of the clones

64
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:17,151
to transform into the shuriken.

65
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,141
When I threw it to Sasuke, it
looked like a real shuriken.

00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,678
NARUTO: Sasuke!

-[yells]

68
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:42,518
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke could
tell it was me in a second.

69
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,654
He spun around so
no one could see

70
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:47,024
and pulled out his own shurken.

71
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,959
Now there were two shuriken.

72
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,894
One was real.

73
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:50,862
One was me.

74
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,874
-Demon wind shuriken,
windmill of shadows.

75
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:05,180
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I hid in
the shadow of the real shuriken.

76
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,785
And my target was
the real Zabuza.

77
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:10,388
-Of course, I knew that I
couldn't fight Zabuza myself.

78
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,990
That wasn't in the game plan.

79
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:14,693
I just wanted to get in there
and breakup his water prison.

80
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,932
I didn't know his clone
would be wrecked too.

81
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:18,966
That was a bonus.

82
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,401
Believe it.

83
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,068
-Don't brag.

84
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,337
You just lucked out.

85
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,406
-The whole thing
was just a fluke.

86
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,276
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): You
can call it a fluke,

87
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,178
but their teamwork was flawless.

88
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,514
They knew what to do without
even talking about it.

89
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,152
Most of the time, they act
like they hate each other.

90
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:36,256
And yet, they're a perfect team.

my grip on the water prison.

But it won't work again.

-You're finished.

172
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,622
ZABUZA: How?

173
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:02,729
Can you see into the future?

174
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:03,997
-Yes.

175
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:06,635
This is your last battle ever.

-[chuckles] You were right.

182
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,637
It was his last battle.

183
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,662
-Ah!

184
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,697

-No vital signs.

188
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:28,677
-Thank you.

189
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,415
I've been tracking
Zabuza for a long time,

190
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,788
waiting for this chance
to finally take him down.

191
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,692
-By your mask, I see
that you're a tracker

192
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:44,464
ninja from the Village
Hidden in the Mist.

193
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:45,666
-Impressive.

194
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:49,136
You're well informed.

195
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,405
-A tracker!

196
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,541
-Naruto, you don't
even know what that is.

197
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,744
You missed the lesson
on it, as usual.

198
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,147
Tracker ninja have
a special role.

199
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,749
Try coming to class some time.

200
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,019
SAKURA: When a rogue ninja
breaks away from his village,

201
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,356
he carries all kinds
of secrets with him,

202
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,924
the secrets of his people.

203
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,129
Trackers are specially trained
to hunt down these ninja

204
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,698
and eliminate them.

205
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:14,104
That way, the secrets of
their people remain secrets.

206
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,506
-That's correct.

207
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,041
I'm a member of
the elite tracking

208
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,444
unit of the Village
Hidden in the Mist.

209
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:22,916
It was my duty to stop Zabuza.

210
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:24,851
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
From his size and voice,

211
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:28,488
he must be the
same age as Naruto.

212
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,091
Yet, he's an elite assassin?

213
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:41,240
He's no ordinary
kid, but what is he?

214
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:54,758
-[growls]

215
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:08,509
-[growls]

216
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,378
-What is this?

217
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,214
Who do you think you are?

218
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,160
Did you hear me?

219
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,063
-Easy, Naruto.

220
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,465
He's not our enemy.

221
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,366
-Huh?

222
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,635
That's not the point.

223
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:30,105
Did you see what he
did, just like that?

224
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:34,543
Zabuza was huge and powerful
like some kind of monster.

225
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:37,381
And this kid, who's
no bigger than me,

226
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:41,520
he brought down Zabuza with
one move like it was nothing.

227
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,756
I mean, what does that make us?

228
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,491
We're just fumbling around.

229
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,194
We don't know anything.

230
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:52,334
How can I accept that?

231
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:55,438
-Well, even if you
don't accept it,

232
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:58,375
still it did happen, Naruto.

233
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:07,620
In this world, there are
kids who are younger than you

234
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:11,059
and yet stronger than me.

235
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,367
-[grumbles]

236
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,256
-Your struggle is over for now.

237
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,126
I must deal with the remains.

238
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,296
There are many
secrets in this body.

239
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:42,300
They must not be allowed to
get into the wrong hands.

240
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:47,206
Please excuse me.

241
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:47,808
Farewell.

242
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:55,384
-He disappeared.

243
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:55,985
-Hmm.

244
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,662
He's gone, Naruto.

245
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:04,963
Let it go.

246
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:12,373
--[growls] What
are we doing here?

247
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,642
We're nothing!

248
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,210
I can't believe it!

249
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,049
-Naruto.

250
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,865
-As ninja, the things we
encounter are never easy.

251
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,935
Save you're anger
for the next enemy.

252
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,280
We haven't completed
our mission yet.

253
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:44,816
We still have to get
the bridge builder

254
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:45,850
to his bridge.

255
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:52,159
--[laughs] Sorry I caused
all this trouble for ya.

256
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:56,165
But you can rest at my house
when we get to the village.

257
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:56,899
-All right.

258
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,201
Let's get a move on.

259
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,548
-(TOGETHER) [gasps]

260
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:12,620
-[gasps]

261
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:13,388
-What?

262
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:16,158
What happened?

263
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,159
-Kakashi Sensei.

264
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,271
Kakashi Sensei!

265
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,954
[Music: Akeboshi, "Wind"]

266
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,576
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
What do we do?

267
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,642
What do we do?

268
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:12,545
Kakashi Sensei is out cold.

269
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:15,393
And Gato's men are sure
to come looking for us.

270
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,360
How are we going to
fight them by ourselves?

271
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,995
We've got to train
to get stronger?

272
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,296
How's climbing trees
going to help us?

273
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:27,232
Well, if Kakashi Sensei
says it will work.

274
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:29,107
Next time, the Forest of Chakra.

275
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:34,007
I'll be kicking butt again.

276
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,073
Believe it.
