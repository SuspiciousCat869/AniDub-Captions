00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:52,004
-Huh?

3
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,538
What's this?

4
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:58,204
A wanted flyer?

5
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:01,171
This fugitive who
calls himself Tokichi,

6
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,504
is a murderer known to have
killed a family of three.

7
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:08,204
He has a bird-shaped
birthmark on his chest.

8
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,938
-A bird-shaped birthmark?

9
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,671
It couldn't be.

10
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:12,804
-Hinata?

11
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,038
What is it?

12
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:17,171
-His face is covered with
scars, so I can't tell,

13
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:23,071
but he has a birthmark
shaped like a bird.

14
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,838
-So, there's a bounty
on the bounty hunter.

15
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:28,771
-Man, could this
mission get any weirder?

16
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:29,538
What's going on?

17
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,604
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Hunt or be Hunted!

Showdown at OK Temple!

00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,004
NARUTO: Where do you think
you're going old man?

20
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,238
Just take it easy
and go back to sleep.

21
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:39,638
-Let me go.

22
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,238
Don't try to stop me.

23
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,138
Gosunkugi will be mine.

24
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:45,238
-And how do you plan on
doing that in your weakened

25
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,271
condition?

26
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,771
You're not in any
shape to fight.

we were attacked

00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:58,371
by another bounty hunter.

30
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,171
Care to explain why
one bounty hunter is

31
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:02,938
trying to nab another
bounty hunter?

32
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:04,671
-This is my business, not yours.

33
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,104
-Your injury again.

34
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:14,704
-Get back!

35
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,171
-Stay still. don't move.

36
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:22,471
-I never committed any crime.

37
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:23,871
-OK, then.

38
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:28,271
How do you figure this wanted
flyer with your picture on it?

39
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:32,304
-Gosunkugi was the
one who did it.

40
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,604
He killed a totally
innocent family of three,

41
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:39,038
and he did it just
to steal some money.

42
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,438
-Wh-- What are
you talking about?

43
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,038
What happened?

44
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:51,638
SAZANAMI: Long ago I lived
in a tiny village, sandwiched

45
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,938
between two great nations.

46
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:54,704
I was a swordsmith.

47
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:14,738
I was poor, but for me, it
was a very pleasant life.

48
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,238
Until the day of the festival.

49
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,038
I was walking along,
on my way to deliver

50
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,138
a sword that had been ordered.

51
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:49,638
And I was hurrying, so I
could get to the festival.

52
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,104
When suddenly--

53
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:53,038
[scream]

54
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:02,838
SAZANAMI: For some reason,
the door was already open.

55
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,238
It's-- it's Tokichi.

56
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,438
I'm delivering a sword.

57
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,838
[crash]

58
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:11,604
[screaming]

59
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,971
SAZANAMI: I told everyone
what had happened.

60
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:24,171
But no matter what I said, the
villagers wouldn't believe me.

61
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:25,704
They said I was
the only person who

62
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,038
hadn't shown up at the festival.

63
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,971
And the wounds
found at the scene

64
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:33,971
were from a very unique blade.

65
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,971
A blacksmith can make
any kind of weapon--

66
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:40,271
so they thought it was me.

67
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,871
-Stand up, Tokichi.

68
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:43,838
-Hey!

69
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,771
-Tokichi!

70
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:45,271
-Quick!

71
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:45,871
After him!

72
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:53,771
SAZANAMI: On that day,
I became a fugitive,

73
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:56,204
wandering aimlessly
from town to town.

74
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,704
My own village had sent
out warnings about me.

75
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,638
Mine was among other
wanted posters.

76
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:14,838
There was even one for the
man who killed that family.

77
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:27,171
I made a vow to capture
Gosunkugi with my own two hands.

78
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:35,038
Once I clear my name, I
will return to my village.

79
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,671
I needed information
about the killer.

80
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:49,138
Anything.

81
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:57,104
So despite the bounty on my own
head, I became a bounty hunter.

82
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,504
-And that's what
you meant when you

83
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,771
said we were
standing in your way.

84
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,604
-The only way I can
prove my innocence

85
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:20,538
is to capture the
real culprit myself.

86
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,838
Then I can finally
return to my home.

87
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:29,638
Please, step aside
and leave him to me.

88
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:37,338
-Hey, you're talking
to a ninja here, buddy.

89
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:39,938
When we get a mission, we
see it all the way through.

90
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:41,438
Even if the worst
were to happen,

91
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:42,838
we won't let him get away.

92
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:46,504
Let's go.

93
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:08,004
-Are you sure that was
such a good idea, Naruto?

94
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,504
-Gosunkugi is an animal.

95
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,471
We gotta take out that guy
no matter what the risk.

96
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:13,171
-Yes.

97
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,838
Naruto's right.

98
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:19,204
-Besides, we can't just let
a guy in Sazanami's condition

99
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,871
track him down on his own.

100
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,004
Not only would he
fail, he might end

101
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,904
up getting killed by
Gosunkugi himself.

102
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,604
-I won't fight back.

103
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,471
You can have it.

104
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:47,738
The bounty on my head.

105
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:51,971
-You're wounded.

106
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:55,371
I could take you so easily.

107
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,338
But before I do,
I want Gosunkugi.

108
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:02,171
Well, I guess I'll
let those kids take

109
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,004
care of the hard part for me.

110
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:18,871
HINATA: The Land of
Stone, post station two.

111
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:22,704
Everything in this town,
politics, economy, military,

112
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:25,638
it's all administered by monks.

113
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,038
-Aw, man.

114
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:30,638
This whole place is
nothing but temples!

115
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:33,471
HINATA: The head temple, the
big one on that mountain,

116
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,004
it's called the OK Temple.

117
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,738
NARUTO: Hey, Hinata,
what's that bell?

118
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:40,738
HINATA: That was created
as a tourist attraction

119
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,971
to get people to
visit the temple.

120
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:44,971
It's the Golden Bell.

121
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,338
-That's dumb.

122
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,338
Look at that thing.

123
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:50,171
It's practically
screaming come steal me.

124
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:51,904
-Wait a second.

125
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,071
I bet Gosunkugi is
after that bell.

126
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,036
I know Gosunkugi's
gonna steal that bell,

127
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,236
but I wonder how he's
gonna pull it off.

-Hm?

133
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:06,903
-You-- You're Gosunkugi's men!

134
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,103
-They're trying to box us in.

135
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,303
Surround us.

136
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:13,036
-Just like they did
against Sazanami.

137
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,503
Byakugan!

138
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:18,836
There's more of them.

139
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,770
Watch out!

140
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:23,170
-What?

141
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,770
Sazanami?

142
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,903
-I can handle these guys.

143
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:27,736
-All right!

144
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,870
Let's go!

145
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:29,736
Eat this!

146
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,536
So, what are you
doing here anyway?

147
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,536
-I just came to
settle the score.

148
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,236
-Yes, but your wound is still--

149
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,903
-Don't worry.

150
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,136
I won't be in your way.

151
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,536
I just want to get him first.

152
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,970
Think of it like a competition.

153
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:55,870
-Heh.

154
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:56,636
Sounds fun.

155
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,603
I accept your challenge.

156
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:02,136
-We can't even start your little
race surrounded like this.

157
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,536
-I still sense
nails underground.

158
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,136
He's waiting for the
right moment to strike.

159
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,470
-I will have him.

160
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,036
-The bell.

161
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,203
It reached the top.

162
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:18,170
-Darn it.

163
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:21,170
Is he--

164
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,670
SAZANAMI (VOICEOVER): No.

165
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,603

The jutsu must've worn off.

167
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,836
-What?

168
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,703
NARUTO: Aw, man.

169
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,036
We fell for it.

170
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,536
-Gives new meaning to the
phrase nailed down, doesn't it?

171
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:41,803
NARUTO: Look.

172
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,803
He's gotta be up by the bell.

173
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:44,670
Let's go.

174
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:45,436
-Hold on.

175
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,803
We've gotta be careful.

176
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,970
Don't forget that the bounty
hunter from last night

177
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,003
is also trying to get Gosunkugi.

178
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:52,203
-Hmph.

179
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,503
Don't worry about him.

180
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:56,570
We'll get your man first, and
no one'll stand in our way.

181
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:57,603
Come on!

182
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,603
-How awful.

183
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:19,003
-That guy is a monster.

184
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:19,570
-Unforgivable.

185
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,970
-Where the heck is Gosunkugi?

186
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,670
-He's gonna get away if
we stall too much, Naruto.

187
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:30,936
-There isn't enough time to
come up with any kind of plan.

188
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,836
We have to do this in one shot.

189
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,236
-Right.

190
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,203

202
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,303
Well, that knocked him out.

203
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:19,003
-Great.

204
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:20,436
So where's Gosunkugi hiding?

-That's him, all right.

208
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,070
-He's all ours now!

209
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,370
Come on, you wanna clear
your name, don't ya?

210
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:50,336
So start acing like
a bounty hunter

211
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,836
and show him what
you're made of!

GOSUNKUGI (VOICEOVER):
Ninja Art, Flying Nail Mist.

00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:14,370
-Ha.

216
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:17,336
Too slow.

217
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,836
[screaming]

00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,203
-Heh, heh.

219
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:29,836
See you around.

220
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:34,136
-He's getting away.

221
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,070
SAZANAMI: You're
forgetting something.

222
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:40,570
-What?

223
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:41,070
-Me!

224
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:44,970
-Wait.

225
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:46,370
Please, just hold on.

226
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:47,803
Please, I beg you!

227
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:58,170
-I'm not cold
blooded like you are.

228
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,036
And besides, if I
killed you, I wouldn't

229
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,403
be able to prove my innocence.

230
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,903
-Well, guess we lost
the competition.

231
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:05,870
-Sure did.

[bark]

00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:10,636
-Huh?

234
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:18,403
-Fugitive Sazanami, AKA Tokichi,
you've hereby been apprehended.

235
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:22,436
And you, fugitive
Gosunkugi, your crime spree

236
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,203
is over as well!

237
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,770
There are countless
charges against you,

238
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:29,403
so I'll be turning you over to
the government for punishment.

239
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,336
-Oh, man!

240
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:35,870
-Darn it.

241
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,803
We can't help.

242
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,203
The authorities
have got him now.

243
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:48,836
-You murder!

244
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,303
-Bring back the
family you killed!

245
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:52,703
-We'll treat you the same
way you treated them!

246
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,270
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Darn it.

247
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:09,536
-You've got a lot of nerve.

248
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,736
How dare you put up
these wanted posters

249
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,270
without a real investigation!

250
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,403
-Not so sure.

251
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:24,870
Honestly, I--

252
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:27,503
-Sazanami was not the
culprit of this crime.

253
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:28,070
No.

254
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,070
It was this man.

255
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:38,670
The infamous thief Gosunkugi was
apprehended and has confessed.

256
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:41,170
And the sword he
used has been seized.

257
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:44,670
Therefore villager Tokichi
is acquitted on all counts.

258
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,903
-What do you have to say, jerks?

259
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,803
You made me track down some
innocent guy for nothing.

260
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:50,836
What are you going to do?

261
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,703
-Why are you helping me?

262
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:03,336
-It all started with some
sob story I overheard.

263
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,636
To a bounty hunter
like me, the truth

264
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,870
shouldn't have made
any difference.

265
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:10,970
Even so, I had to
find out for myself.

266
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,003
I needed to make
sure you were really

267
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:16,803
the horrible criminal these
posters said you were.

268
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:17,670
-You.

269
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:19,736
-I got a name, you know.

270
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,770
Gatsu.

271
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,970
You and I are bounty hunters.

272
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,670
We're part of the
same trade now.

273

-Gatsu.

274
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:32,170
-Tokichi, we are so sorry.

275
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:35,103
-Please forgive us, Tokichi.

276
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:38,503
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Everything
turned out well, Sazanami.

277
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:39,970
-Let's go.

278
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:40,470
-Yeah.

00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,003
-You know, after
all this time away,

280
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:52,370
I'm kind of getting homesick.

281
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,136
I guess I missed the
good old Leaf Village

282
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,970
more than I thought I would.

283
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,103
-Oh, yeah?

284
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:59,770
Well, a failed mission's
still a failed mission.

-What did you say?

287
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:11,170
You failed yet another mission?

288
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,470
-Forget what I said.

289
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:15,170
I don't want to go home.
