-Sakura!

3
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,176
It was worth teaching you
genjutsu during survival

4
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,645
training for the genin exam.

5
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,284
You truly do have
a talent for it.

6
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:06,865
Release the genjutsu, and
wake Naruto and Shikamaru.

7
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:09,069
Naruto will be delighted.

8
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,741
He'll be getting a mission
after such a long time.

9
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,678
-What kind of mission?

10
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,051
-You'll have to be
careful on this one.

11
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:21,960
It's the first A-rank assignment
since the Land of the Waves.

14
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,550
-But Sensei, what are you doing?

15
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,958
With this battle going on, why
send us off on some mission?

16
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,931
-Sasuke's chasing Gaara
and the other Sand ninja.

17
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:41,798
-What?

18
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,571
-Sakura, release the genjutsu.

19
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:46,942
Wake Naruto and Shikamaru,
and follow Sasuke.

20
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:55,091
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): I feel
uneasy about that weird chakra.

21
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,851
- But then shouldn't we wake
Ino and Choji and go in a group?

22
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:09,987
-No time.

23
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,091
I suspect that
many Sound and Sand

24
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:15,731
shinobi may have already
infiltrated this village.

25
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,203
Besides, if you have
more than the four ninja

26
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:21,241
essential to a squad, it takes
longer to get anything done

27
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:24,681
and becomes more difficult
to hide from the enemy.

28
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:29,390
You did learn that in Academy
patrol training, didn't you?

29
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:30,693
-Of course.

30
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,964
With four squad
members, that means

31
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,700
you'll be coming with us, right?

32
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:35,502
-No.

33
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,941
I must not leave this place.

00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:50,030
Pakkun here will track
down Sasuke by scent.

-Wait.

38
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:53,270
Seriously, our fourth
member is a puppy?

39
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,178
-All right.

40

Listen, little girl.

Don't you dare go around saying
I'm just some cute puppy.

SAKURA (VOICEOVER): But
I didn't even say "cute."

Hey, what's going on, Sakura?

I'll fill you in later.

Just stay down.

this whole time?

-You really scammed

Why were you pretending to
be asleep this whole time?

-I didn't want to get involved.

57
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,988
Just give me a break.

Huh?

-Now, I'll explain the mission.

71
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:00,649
As soon as I do, go
through that opening.

72
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:03,888
First, track down
Sasuke and stop him.

73
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:07,896
Then find a safe location
and await further orders.

-I'll tell you what
happened on the way.

Now let's go!

-Huh?

-Look, if this mission
is a success, as a reward

I'll let you touch
my palm, or my pads.

So there's no reason to sulk.

But my paws are so
soft and supple!

be OK by themselves?

-Yes, they'll be fine.

95

Pakkun will protect them.

As long as they
don't go too far.

-I never thought I'd get to
face you in battle again.

broken from the inside.

If Lord Hokage would just take
out one of those Sound ninja,

100
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,437
then we could help.

101
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,410
-OK, let's get this
show on the road.

102
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:44,048
-Put up a barrier
on the inside, too.

103
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:44,549
-Right.

able to get out of this easily.

-Of course it won't be easy.

I know you.

109

It would be a big bother
if someone came in here

110
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,237
and got in your
way, wouldn't it?

us are too fast!

329
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,013
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
They're going to catch us,

330
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,415
and that'll be the end of us.

331
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,385
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Then let's
ambush them and get them first.

332
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,024
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Even if
we do, we probably won't win.

333
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,660
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Quit being negative!

334
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,263
We got to do something.

335
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:29,404
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): There's
only one thing we can do.

336
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:32,344
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "A Shirker's Call

337
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,880
To Action-- Layabout No More."

338
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,241
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
All right.

339
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:39,441
It's not my style, but I
guess we have no choice.
