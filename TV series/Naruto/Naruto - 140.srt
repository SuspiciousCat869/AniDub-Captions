00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,209
It's no use.

172
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:15,109
Even though it's mine.

173
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:18,109
-If my heart should be
faster, then your heart

174
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:20,209
will beat right along with it.

175
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:24,109
And of course you realize when
my heartbeat comes to an end,

176
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:27,009
so, too, does yours.

-Don't!

179
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,276
What's the point?

180
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:32,376
If you stop your heart,
then you'll die, too!

181
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:33,909
-Yes, I'll die.

182
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:37,043
But then, it hardly matters now.

183
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:39,976
I've already promised my
body to Lord Orochimaru

184
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,076
to use at his disposal.

185
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:45,943
Aaugh!

you planning on doing?

189
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:08,109
-Heh.

190
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:11,509
Now all I have to do is squeeze.

191
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,909
Then I'll die and so will you.

192
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:25,304
Now all I have to do is squeeze.

193
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,137
And then I'll die.

194
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,104
And so will you.

195
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,537
Let's go.

196
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,937
You can come with me.

00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:37,304
-So, how's it feel?

201
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:40,470
Having your heart crushed
from inside your own chest?

202
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:44,804
Don't worry, you'll be out
of your misery soon enough.

-Don't be such a fool!

208
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:58,404
If you take me out, then
Naruto goes with me.

209
00:11:58,437 --> 00:11:59,637
-I have a better idea.

210
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,037
Let's just do this!

211
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,970

-You're wasting your time.

00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:11,404
The thread is spun from chakra.

215
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:13,837
It can't be severed.

220
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:31,704
What do I do?

221
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,737
What do I do?

222
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,704
Naruto is suffering
right in front of me

223
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,170
and I'm helpless to stop it!

224
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,104
-Don't you worry, Sakura.

225
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,604
I don't care what happens.

226
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:51,770
Nothing's gonna stop
me, not 'til I've

227
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,970
delivered on my promise!

228
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:59,304
-This ridiculous
bravado ends here!

229
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:02,070
Time to leave this mortal coil.

230
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:05,537
Then you can finally
see your beloved Sasuke.

When the water
reached the top, I

pushed against the ceiling
as hard as I could,

me to head for the place

worried about Arashi,

I just had to come.

-Tha-- that frog
just spoke to me!

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,837
-Now that I think about it,
I guess it was kind of silly

294
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,737
trying to open that thing
just by pushing on it.

-Ugh.

00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:28,870
But my kunai wasn't cutting
those threads at all.

297
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,470
So how come it worked after
I wrapped your tag around it?

298
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,504
-Because the chakra thread
is one of the Fuma Clan's

299
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,070
most guarded ninja techniques.

-Oh, that explains it!

It was you again.

-Master Kagaro.

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,837
She's a Fuma jounin.

-What is it?

312
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:16,170
What's wrong?

313
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,404
-Hey, Sasame.

314
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,370
It's all right.

315
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,837
Don't be frightened.

Lord Orochimaru has simple

you for a fool!

-Yeah, and what about
Sasame's cousin, huh?

00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:34,504
Where are they keeping Arashi?

-Lord Orochimaru is our savior.

The honorable Fuma
Clan has fallen,

324

but he will lift us up again.

Higher than all other shinobi.

spouting that trash?

Enough, already!

You were always so close to
one another, weren't you?

-[gasping] Master Kagero.

341
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,204
-Well, Sasame.

342
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:54,570
What you want to do?

343
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,304
-You can wait here, if you want.

344
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,370
-I have to see him.

345
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:06,104
I don't care what awaits
me beyond that door!

346
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:09,770
I came to find Arashi and
that's what I'm going to do!

347
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:10,604
-Mmhmm!

348
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,870
I like your guts, girly!

349
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:13,704
-Right!

350
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,570
We forge on together, then!

351
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,104
-Yeah!

352
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,370
Let's do it.

353
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,137
MALE SPEAKER: Sasame.

354
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,337
-There could be some
sort of trap here.

355
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,937
-Just leave it to me.

-It's good of you
to come, Sasame.

360
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,237
-Where's my cousin?

361
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:16,704
-[gasping] Arashi!

362
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,204
Arashi!

363
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,037
What's wrong, Arashi?

364
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,637
-You're mistaken.

365
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,137
I'm not the Arashi you knew.

-What the heck is
going on around here?

371
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:59,704
-The bodies and the skills
of the Fuma Clan's strongest

372
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:02,670
jounin have merged
and I have been

373
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:06,404
reborn as the ultimate shinobi!

374
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:12,037
Now let me show you the
most powerful ninjutsu

375
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,437
you've ever seen, Sasame!

376
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,370
-Arashi!

377
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,804
What have you done to yourself?

378
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,970
-Orochimaru, you lousy snake!

379
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:26,558
I won't forgive him for
this, no matter what!

SAKURA: I'm sorry.

382
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,998
Forgive me, Naruto.

383
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:08,065
I haven't been a
help you at all.

384
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,531
The only thing I do
is weigh you down.

385
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:13,131
I haven't changed one bit.

386
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:18,031
But Naruto, Sasame, I've
learned so much from you both.

387
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,598
That's why I want to change
the kind of person I am.

388
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:24,498
This time, this time it's
my turn to give it my all.

Next time, "Sakura's
Determination!"
