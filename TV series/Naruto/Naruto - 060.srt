2
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:53,113
-Huh?

3
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,315
-Naruto.

4
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,918
-Yeah, but he's totally
late, of course.

5
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:01,962
-Hey, wait.

6
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,465
Where's Sasuke?

7
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,270
-I'm fighting Dosu,
but he's missing, too.

8
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,240
-Hey, knock it off.

9
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:09,910
Quit your fidgeting, you two.

10
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:12,381
Stand up straight and
present yourself proudly

11
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:13,350
to the spectators.

12
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,852
-Huh?

13
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,422
[crowd cheering]

14
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:34,521
-You guys are the heroes
of this final competition.

15
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,567
-No sign of Sasuke yet.

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,472
-No, a team of Andu Black
Ops are searching for him,

17
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:47,778
but so far, they've
found nothing.

18
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:51,551
He may already be in
Orochimaru's hands,

19
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,490
in which case, of course,
we may never find him.

20
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,165
-I understand.

21
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,277
Aha, you made it.

22
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,246
Welcome, Lord Kazekage.

23
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:25,813
You must be weary having
come all this way.

24
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,583
-Not at all.

25
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,956
I'm only glad that for
your sake the arena is here

26
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,224
in the Leaf Village.

27
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:35,397
As strong as you are, I'm
sure a long journey would

28
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,970
have proven difficult
for you at your age.

29
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:42,409
Isn't it about time you decided
who will succeed you Kazekage?

30
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:43,378
-Hmm?

31
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:44,914
[laughing]

32
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:50,324
You act as if I were
an old man, there's

33
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:52,561
plenty of life left in me.

34
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:56,001
No, I plan on staying here
for some time to come.

35
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:04,983
Now then.

36
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,387
It's time for the
final rounds to begin.

37
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,101
Welcome all, and
our deepest thanks

38
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,072
for coming here to
the Village Hidden

39
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:21,379
in the Leaves for this
year's Chunin Selection.

40
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:25,086
We have come to the final
competition between the eight

41
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:28,425
candidates who made it
through the preliminaries.

42
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,065
We ask that no one leaves
until all the matches have

43
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,334
been completed.

44
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,938
Now everyone enjoy.

45
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,811
-You said eight candidates.

46
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,747
Aren't you missing one?

47
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,198
-Oh, there's one more thing
before we get started.

48
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:54,338
Look it over.

49
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:54,939
-Huh?

50
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:02,586
-There's been a slight
change in the match-ups.

51
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,790
But now it's set,
so everyone take

52
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:07,329
one last look at who
you'll be facing.

53
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:11,770
-I thought I was supposed
to fight an extra match.

54
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,309
Hey, so that Dosu
guy dropped out.

55
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:24,159
-I was planning on attacking
you while you slept.

56
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,966
If I fight and defeat you
now, then in the next round,

57
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,973
I can battle the one I
really want to face, Sasuke.

58
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:38,050
-What-- what-- what
in the world are you?

59
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:41,924
Aaagh.

60
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,332
-Uh, question.

61
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,235
Question.

62
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:49,437
-What is it?

63
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,576
-I was just wondering what
will happen to Sasuke?

64
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,413
I mean, if he doesn't show up?

65
00:05:57,953 --> 00:05:59,355
-Where is Sasuke?

66
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:02,193
And why did he sneak out
of his hospital room?

67
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:08,839
But maybe he didn't.

68
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:11,043
Maybe somebody took him.

69
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,347
-If a candidate is
not here in the arena

70
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,623
at the time his name is
called, he forfeits the match.

71
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,032
-It doesn't make sense.

72
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,003
Sasuke's not the
type to miss this,

73
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,606
even if he had to
drag himself here.

74
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,726
-What is it, Gaara?

75
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,696
Where you going?

76
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,066
-To remind myself I'm alive.

77
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,437
-One more time.

78
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,906
Come on, what's wrong?

79
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,709
Not tired already, are you?

80
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:12,386
Come on, Sasuke.

81
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,026
-Yaaah!

82
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,582
-No, after all my warnings not
to draw attention to himself.

83
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,921
He wouldn't have killed
Sasuke and [inaudible], too.

84
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,123
Would he?

85
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,132
-All right, listen up.

86
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,171
The terrain's different, but the
rules are the same as before.

87
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:43,409
That is that there are no rules.

88
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,979
The match continues
until one candidate

89
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:48,351
acknowledges defeat or dies.

90
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:54,495
That being said, if I
determine that a match is over,

91
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:57,300
I can step in and
stop it at any time.

92
00:07:57,334 --> 00:08:00,039
And no arguments permitted.

93
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:00,640
Understood?

94
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:07,017
These are the opponents
for the first match.

95
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:13,629
Naruto Uzumaki, Neji Hyuga.

96
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:14,931
Those two stay.

97
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,202
The rest of you can go
to the waiting area.

98
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:26,319
-Byakugan versus
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

99
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:38,641
-Hey, Hinanta, look,
these seats are free.

100
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,416
-Oh, thanks.

101
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:48,692
-I think this it's going
to be an interesting match.

102
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:49,293
-Naruto.

103
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,334
-Hey, Sakura.

104
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,637
-Um-hmm.

105
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,074
-I know that you're worried
about Sasuke, but come on.

106
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,443
Don't be such a lump.

107
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:00,547
Aren't you going to at
least cheer Naruto on?

108
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:06,057
-You're right.

109
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,560
-That's more like it.

110
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:10,231
Not that the poor runt has
a hope in hell against Neji.

111
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,600
-He's not that bad.

112
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,704
-Are you kidding?

113
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:15,073
Not that bad?

114
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,377
Is that the best you can do?

115
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,614
-Who would have believed
that little squirt would

116
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,851
survive this long?

117
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:23,188
-Yeah.

118
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,826
He's been one lucky kid
so far, but his luck's

119
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:26,860
about to run out.

120
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,833
He'll never survive this one.

121
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,437
-Yeah, it's going to be painful.

122
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,408
Going up against one
of the Hyuga clan,

123
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,776
he doesn't have a chance.

124
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,887
-Yeah, I thought
that, too, at first.

125
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:43,457
And look what happened.

126
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,031
He's out there, and I'm
sitting up here on my butt.

127
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:49,235
[dog whimpers] Huh?

128
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:51,038
Yeah, Akamaru, what is it?

129
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:54,310
[dog whimpers] What
the-- are you sure?

130
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:58,584
Where?

131
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:04,462
Up there.

132
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:12,008
What the hell are the
Anbu Black Ops doing here?

133
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,278
Something's going on.

134
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:25,032
-You got anything to say to me?

135
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,428
-Only what I told
you the last time.

136
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,933
-Once a failure,
always a failure.

137
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:45,435
You can't change that.

138
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,446
-Hinata, I give you my word.

139
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:03,000
I vow to win.

140
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:09,745
-He as the look.

141
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,851
He's calmer now,
more sure of himself.

142
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,129
So much the better for me.

143
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:22,735
I can't wait to see the
look of despair on your face

144
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:27,511
when you learn that your foolish
vow is impossible to keep.

145
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:30,116
-Are we going to stand
here talking all day?

146
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,261
Let's get going.

147
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,463
Show me what you've got.

148
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:44,207
-All right.

149
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:48,081
Now let the first match begin.

150
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,982
-Watch closely, Hanibi.

151
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,853
There's no one in
the Hyuga clan who

152
00:12:56,886 --> 00:13:00,793
has inherited such a
strong Kekkei Genkai.

153
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,099
His is stronger than
your older sister's.

154
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,136
-Stronger than hers?

155
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,206
-Perhaps even
stronger than yours.

156
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,117
-Watch yourself.

157
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,588
This is no pushover
you're up against.

158
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,258
Not want that Byakugan of his.

159
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:32,016
You don't want to get
too close with this guy.

160
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,686
But does Naruto know that?

161
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,207
-Yaaah.

162
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,718
-You idiot!

163
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:13,658
A frontal attack
will never work.

164
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:14,259
-Aaagh.

165
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,484
Aaah.

166
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,196
-Naruto, watch out.

167
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,511
-Hmph-umph.

168
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,488
Aaah.

169
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:22,046
-Naruto, he can see
your chakra points.

170
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,553
-Hitting one directly
can affect chakra flow,

171
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:27,523
either halting it
or increasing it

172
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:30,596
depending on how the attacker
strikes the chakra points.

173
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:38,676
-Oh, no.

174
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,626
-Hmph.

175
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,494
I missed.

176
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,670
-Almost blew it.

177
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,041
If I get to close he
can turn off my chakra,

178
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,211
and there goes my Jutsu.

179
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:01,050
I'll have to fight
him from a distance.

180
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,154
-Do you understand now?

181
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:07,428
You have no way of beating me.

182
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:08,196
-Heh.

183
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,465
Get real.

184
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:12,737
I was just checking
you out, that's all.

185
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,338
-Huh?

186
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:24,024
-OK, now that we're warmed
up, we can get started.

187
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,603
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

188
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,948
-That's using your head, Naruto.

189
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,953
That'll confuse him.

190
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:42,424
-Well, isn't he something?

191
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,097
-That Shadow Clone Jutsu was
a Jounin-level technique.

192
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,603
Where'd that kid ever pick
up a technique like that?

193
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:52,476
-This match could be more
interesting than we thought.

194
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,154
-Shadow Clones.

195
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:01,158
I see.

196
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,694
Quite clever.

197
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,432
He's distributed his
chakra evenly among them,

198
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:10,808
so that even my Byakugan
can't pick out the real one.

199
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,111
No matter.

200
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,515
You can't hide for long.

201
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:18,355
-Well, we'll just
see about that.

202
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:19,992
-If you're coming, then come on.

203
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:25,969
-It's no use.

204
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,373
No matter how many times
Naruto attacks him,

205
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:31,445
Neji can win on
his defects alone.

206
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:41,196
-Hey, don't ever, don't ever,
I mean, never count me out.

207
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,700
-He got him.

208
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:05,974
-Just wait.

209
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:16,459
-Not bad.

210
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:17,661
But let's see you do that again.

211
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,539
Come on.

212
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:36,896
Aaagh.

213
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:45,879
Aaah.

214
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:06,182
This guy, he must have eyes
in the back of his head.

215
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:21,310
-You thought you
could beat Hokage?

216
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,146
It's absurd.

217
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:23,747
Never.

218
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:29,157
These eyes of mine
show me many things.

219
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,796
One thing they've shown
me, people's limitations

220
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,802
are set, fixed,
and unchangeable.

221
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:37,605
Only a fool wastes
his time trying

222
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,876
to become something
he can never be.

223
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,490
-A fool, huh?

224
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:49,059
Not this crap again.

225
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:52,365
Who are you to judge what
a person can or can't be.

226
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:54,702
-Do you think anyone
can be Hokage?

227
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,873
That all it takes is
a little hard work?

228
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,882
Open your eyes.

229
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:03,819
Of all the shinobi
in all the world,

230
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:06,056
think how few ever
become Hokage.

231
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,566
They were born
destined to be Hokage.

232
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,339
It's not something you become
merely by trying to become it.

233
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,210
They were chosen by destiny.

234
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:23,020
Each person is given
his own path to follow.

235
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:27,862
And he must follow it
obediently to the end.

236
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,242
There is only one destiny
we all share equally.

237
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:45,060
Death.

238
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,978
-There's hatred in his eyes.

239
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,947
Hatred for the main
branch of the family.

240
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:02,657
-Yeah?

241
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:04,661
So what?

242
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:06,298
You can think that
way if you want.

243
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,351
People always tell me I just
don't know when to give up.

244
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:18,954
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

245
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:31,799
[theme music]

246
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,731
-What's going on?

247
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:07,304
I hit him with my best shot,
and I'm the one sent flying.

248
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:08,339
No problem.

249
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:09,474
I can learn from my mistakes.

250
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,211
OK, I can't beat
him inside, and I

251
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:12,479
can't beat him from the outside.

252
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:13,749
So what have I learned?

253
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:15,552
I can't beat him.

254
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:16,621
No, that's not right.

255
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:17,723
Of course, I can beat him.

256
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,426
I've got to beat him.

257
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:21,095
I made a promise to Hinata.

258
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:24,571
Next time ultimate
defense, zero blind spot.

259
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,305
Don't count your
chickens bug-eyes,

260
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,105
you ain't seen nothing yet.
