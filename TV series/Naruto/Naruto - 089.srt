1
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:08,961
[theme song]

2
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:50,889
-OK, let's go!

3
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:58,856
Eh?

4
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,323
-Let's go?

5
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:06,689
Are you kidding me?

6
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:09,956
Quit acting like a stupid
little kid, will ya?

7
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,956
-What the-- why are
you in such a bad mood?

8
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:12,989
-Well, what do you think?

9
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,989
We're still in the
middle of my training.

10
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:17,256
You said there were three
steps to learn, right?

11
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,023
Well, I've only
learned two of them.

12
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,556
Now quit holding out on me.

13
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:23,756
-Relax.

14
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,756
You can work on the third
one while we're walking.

15
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,356
-What?

16
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,156
Are you serious?

17
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:28,656
Huh?

18
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:33,523
A balloon?

19
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:34,023
-Here.

20
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:39,989
-OK.

21
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:42,189
So what's the deal?

22
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:45,156
An ordinary balloon?

23
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,489
-The first step you
learned was rotation.

24
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:52,589
The second step was power.

25
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:57,523
The third and final step
for you to master is this.

26
00:02:57,556 --> 00:03:00,189
NARUTO: An Impossible Choice--
The Pain Within Tsunade's

27
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:00,689
Heart.

28
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:23,256
Ugh!

29
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:27,556
What do you mean
by this already?

30
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:30,356
-It looks like I'm simply
holding an ordinary balloon,

31
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:31,189
doesn't it?

32
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:33,156
-What do you mean, looks like?

33
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,489
That is all you're
doing, you pervy weirdo.

34
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:36,656
-Huh.

35
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:37,989
Let me try again.

36
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:41,789
Over on my left this time.

37
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:45,423
Let's see what's really
happening inside the balloon.

38
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,489
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Whoa.

39
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:54,289
The chakra is spinning
wildly and getting faster.

40
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:56,689
But it's still perfectly round.

41
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:58,056
It's almost like--

42
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,256
-Take a look at that.

43
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,123
Like a small typhoon.

44
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:05,623
-So then what you're
doing in your left hand

45
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:08,256
is also happening in the
balloon on your right?

46
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,189
-That's right.

47
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,189
What do you think?

48
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:12,623
Nifty, huh?

49
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,523
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Awesome.

50
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:17,456
He's got all of that
chakra whizzing around.

51
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,389
And the balloon
isn't even moving.

52
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,823
There's more power than
when the rubber ball popped,

53
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:26,756
and way more spin to it.

54
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:27,789
-Now listen.

55
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,423
In the third step
you've gotta draw up

56
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:32,089
100% of what you've
learned so far.

57
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,756
And then maintain it.

58
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,689
In other words, keeping
the power and the rotation

59
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,556
of your chakra at their maximum.

60
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,856
First visualize a thin membrane
just inside the balloon,

61
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,689
then of compressing
the chakra inside it.

62
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,289
-Hey, I think I get it now!

63
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:55,956
So this stage is
about keeping up

64
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:58,089
the power and rotation
that I learned,

65
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,556
only this time without
letting them pop open

66
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:01,789
a delicate balloon!

67
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,523
-Well, you're starting
to get the hang of this.

68
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:06,389
Good!

69
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:07,623
-Hm?

70
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,489
So wait.

71
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,589
Hold on a second.

72
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,556
Why exactly am I going
to all this trouble?

73
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:15,256
-Come here.

74
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,656
I'll show you.

75
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,023
Watch closely.

76
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,723
After the first two steps
of training, you get this.

77
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:28,389
-Whoa.

78
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:48,523
-Then, once you've mastered
the third step-- you get this!

79
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:10,556
If you can keep that small
typhoon the size of your palm,

80
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,189
then the energy will
be unable to disperse.

81
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:15,923
It'll spin faster and
faster, and its power

82
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:18,923
will become more
and more compressed.

83
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:22,323
And its destructive
power will reach its max.

84
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:27,589
So, there you have it.

85
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,556
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Right.

86
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:34,589
This'll be no sweat.

87
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,156
OK.

88
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:54,023
This feels right.

89
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,389
Now!

90
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:15,323
Keep it going-- keep it going--
keep it going-- keep it going!

91
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,056
-There's no cutting
corners here.

92
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,889
Get your power and rotation to
100%, and then maintain them.

93
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:29,789
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
This is crazy.

94
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:33,656
Unless I can perfectly control
my power it's impossible.

95
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,589
I see now.

96
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:43,123
This third step-- it's
on a whole other level

97
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:44,989
compared to the first two.

98
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:46,789
-I told you, didn't I?

99
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:48,723
This is an A-rank technique.

100
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:53,223
It's a highly advanced
ninjutsu, kid.

101
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,223
OK.

102
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,289
That's enough
explaining for today.

103
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:59,823
You can practice on the road.

104
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:02,156
-Hey, hold on a minute.

105
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,589
Do we have to rush?

106
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:04,656
Give me a chance to--

107
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,356
-We've already
wasted enough time

108
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,889
waiting for you to
recover your strength.

109
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,856
There's no guarantee that
Tsunade will stay in this town

110
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,123
much longer.

111
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:17,023
-Wha-- yeah, but-- but--

112
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:19,789
-It's not like she's gonna
bump into some old acquaintance

113
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:23,023
and start reminiscing
over the good old days.

114
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:23,589
Come on.

115
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,123
Let's go.

116
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:25,856
-All right.

117
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:08,889
-It's been quite a long
time, hasn't it, Orochimaru?

118
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,289
-Indeed.

119
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:12,823
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

120
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:16,023
-What do you want with
me after all this time?

121
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,756
You feel like kicking around
stories of the old days?

122
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:24,923
-Actually, I was hoping
to ask you for a favor.

123
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,756
-His heartbeat is racing.

124
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,523
And he's burning up,
by the look of him.

125
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:32,456
Definitely signs of
prolonged fatigue.

126
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,423
And those arms--

127
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,823
-Lady Tsunade, I'm sure
you've surmised by now.

128
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,789
-Find someone else.

129
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,456
I haven't treated
anyone in years.

130
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,289
-That won't do.

131
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:51,856
Surely you must realize how
serious these wounds are.

132
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:55,889
There isn't anyone who can
cure him of his affliction.

133
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:58,856
Except, of course, for
the legendary sannin

134
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,256
and medical genius,
Lady Tsunade.

135
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:03,823
Only you can do this.

136
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:11,623
-Those arms of yours--
that's no ordinary injury.

137
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,789
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): A special
sealing jutsu, or something.

138
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:20,789
-What have you
gotten yourself into?

139
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,289
-Nothing, really.

140
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,223
I was just killing
the Third Hokage.

141
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,723
-Impossible.

142
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,423
Is this true?

143
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,323
-Oh, come now, Tsunade.

144
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:37,756
Quit shooting me
that dirty look.

145
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:41,623
Anything that has form
must one day decay.

146
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:42,623
Even men.

147
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,589
But I don't really need to
tell you that, now do I?

148
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,856
After all, you let the
two most dear to you

149
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,056
march off to their deaths.

150
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:31,170
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): Let the
two most dear to her die?

151
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:32,704
I see.

152
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,837
This is a wicked
game he's playing.

153
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,870
-Such a pity.

154
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:51,104
It really was a terrible
way for them to die.

155
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:51,604
-Scum.

156
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,170
Needles.

157
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:04,070
Dipped in poison.

158
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:08,104
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): She's fast.

159
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:10,170
-Get out of my way!

160
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:13,504
-I won't let you!

161
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:15,137
-Shizune, calm down!

162
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:33,137
KABUTO (VOICEOVER): This
assistant-- she's powerful.

163
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,637
-Orochimaru.

164
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,637
You were always this twisted,
even when we were kids.

165
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:58,204
Come on, you know
the type of gal I am.

166
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,637
Don't even kid with me, OK?

167
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:24,737
Or shall I kill you
where you stand?

168
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,837
KABUTO (VOICEOVER):
She's strong.

169
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,070
And terrifying.

170
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,837
She must be single, no doubt.

171
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:38,437
-Tsunade's impatient, and
extremely quick to anger.

172
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,904
[pop]

173
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:44,170
Come on, kid.

174
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:46,137
We don't have time
for kicking back.

175
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,870
If we don't hurry, who knows
where that wayward woman will

176
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:51,104
scamper off to next.

177
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,804
-Listen, you pervy sage.

178
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:55,137
That's no way to talk
to an apprentice who's

179
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,004
working his butt off!

180
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,404
-Oh, zip it.

181
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,104
Just calm down, will you?

182
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,870
Tsunade's the priority here.

183
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:04,604
-Son of a-- well,
how do you like that?

184
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:11,670
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Pervy
sage came all this way

185
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:14,370
to find this lady.

186
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:15,670
She must really be something.

187
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,670
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): I
hope she's still here.

188
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,170
-Please.

189
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:30,904
We haven't come all
this way to fight.

190
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,837
We're here to negotiate.

191
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,670
-Negotiate?

192
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:36,970
-That's right.

193
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,570
-Are you trying
to make me laugh?

194
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:44,270
I've told you once already.

195
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,437
Now get the hell
out of my sight.

196
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,304
-I'm afraid that's
just impossible.

197
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,204
-Get out of here.

198
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:54,104
-You're the only ones who can
cure Lord Orochimaru's arms.

199
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:55,537
You know that.

200
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,237
-I'm warning you.

201
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,370
-We're not asking for charity.

202
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:01,004
We can make a deal here.

203
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:02,904
-I'll count down from five.

204
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:06,870
I suggest you leave
before I'm done.

205
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:10,504
Otherwise I'll have to make you.

206
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,770
-Please, try to remain calm.

207
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,870
This could prove
beneficial for both of us.

208
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:15,370
-Five.

209
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:18,470
Four.

210
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,870
Three.

211
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:25,370
Two.

212
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:32,037
And one.

213
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,837
-I'm offering to bring
your dear little brother

214
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,504
and your beloved back to life.

215
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,637
With a forbidden jutsu
that I have developed.

216
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:04,270
I can't help but notice
that you haven't chased us

217
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:07,637
off yet, my old friend.

218
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,170
I suppose it's safe to assume
we have a deal here then?

219
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,370
-Eh, sure.

220
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:21,370
I know the young lady.

221
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:22,604
-You're sure?

222
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:23,937
-Yeah.

223
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,870
Think she said she needed to
win back the money she lost.

224
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,637
Said she was heading over there.

225
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,604
-Rotation and power.

226
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,870
Charge them both
up to the maximum.

227
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:36,237
And then maintain them.

228
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,504
-Hey, kid.

229
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,470
-Huh?

230
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:39,870
-How about it, sonny boy?

231
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:41,704
Wanna throw the dice around?

232
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:42,870
-Heading over there?

233
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:46,604
Well, where do you mean?

234
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:47,904
-Check it out.

235
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,004
If you roll the dice and it
comes up odd, that's han.

236
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,570
And if it's even, then it's cho.

237
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:53,670
-Look, zip it, pal.

238
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,670
I'm trying to get some
training done here.

239
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,637
Quit bugging me.

240
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,804
-What are you talking about?

241
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:59,670
This is a gambling house.

242
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,104
Now why don't you ditch
that balloon there?

243
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:03,770
We'll have more fun with these.

244
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,170
-What, are you kidding?

245
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:06,404
I have work to do.

246
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,937
I don't have time to be
messing around shooting dice.

247
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,670
-Man, what a boring kid.

248
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,070
-Oh, shut up.

249
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,470
-So, you gonna tell me where?

250
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:18,770
-Sure, but don't expect it to
be free in a place like this.

251
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,270
-Oh.

252
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,070
-Let's make a deal.

253
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,770
If you win, then the
information will be free.

254
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:33,637
But if you lose it's going
to cost you a thousand.

255
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,737
-You're on, son!

256
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,037
-So what'll it be?

257
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,304
Han, or cho?

258
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:37,837
-OK.

259
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,704
Here we go.

260
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,204
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Hm.

261
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:46,104
Let's see.

262
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,104
I'm exactly 50 years old.

263
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,770
So--

264
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,570
-Gimme cho!

265
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,504
-Remember, if it's han, I win.

266
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,337
Now then, let's see what we got.

267
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:02,504
-Oh!

268
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:06,637
Two and five-- that makes han!

269
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,370
-What the heck's going on?

270
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:09,337
-There goes my thousand.

271
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,470
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Nice, Naruto.

272
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,504
-What do you know?

273
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,804
Looks like I win, doesn't it?

274
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:19,304
-Huh?

275
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,337
Ugh.

276
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,637
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Aw, man.

277
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,037
I screwed it up again!

278
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,337
-Maintain--

279
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:32,837
-Well, great.

280
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,070
Where am I supposed to look now?

281
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:36,504
[pop]

282
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:47,370
-Well, I'm stumped.

283
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:51,637
That woman isn't
anywhere to be found.

284
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,137
-Hm?

285
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,370
Huh?

286
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:00,870
Me?

287
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:05,670
-Scratch off cards?

288
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:06,404
-Kids, grown-ups.

289
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,304
Everyone loves the lotto.

290
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:09,670
Give it a whirl, cutie.

291
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:10,637
It's fun.

292
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,637
-Uh--

293
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,604
-What about this one, hm?

294
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,637
You'll know right
away if you've won.

295
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:22,304
-You're cuter when you're
chubby, aren't you, froggy?

296
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:23,737
Yes you are.

297
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,237
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

298
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,804
he won off of just one ticket.

299
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:31,504
Kid must have a
knack for gambling.

300
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,637
If only he was that
sharp on his jutsu.

301
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,704
Anyhow, I need to focus
on finding Tsunade.

302
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,404
Where could should be?

303
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:43,804
She couldn't have gotten
far in so short a time.

304
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,670
Well, I guess we better
find some high ground

305
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:51,904
and take a look around.

306
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,470
If I remember it correctly,
this town surrounds a castle.

307
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,537
If we climb up to the top--

308
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,770
-Hey, Naruto.

309
00:19:58,804 --> 00:19:59,270
Come on.

310
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,370
This way.

311
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:01,370
-Huh?

312
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:01,870
All right.

313
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:11,604
-Come now.

314
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:13,304
Don't you want to
see them again?

315
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,170
Dear Tsunade.

316
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,804
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Nawaki.

317
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:24,304
Dan.

318
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,337
-What do you plan on
doing once your arms have

319
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,470
been restored to you?

320
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:44,604
I you know me.

321
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:46,770
I've never been one to lie.

322
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,504
So I'll just give you the truth.

323
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:49,804
How about that?

324
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,270
-Hey, hold on a minute.

325
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,104
Where's this castle
you were talking about?

326
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,737
-It's gone.

327
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:19,904
-In addition to grabbing all
I desire-- this time around

328
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:22,970
I'm going to grind the hidden
Leaf Village into just.

-Hey!

331
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,022
Enough already!

332
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:05,455
I don't care if she's one of the
sannin, a medical specialist,

333
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:07,422
or the legendary kunoichi!

334
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:10,755
There's no way I'm gonna accept
this lady's the Fifth Hokage.

335
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:15,755
It doesn't matter if she is
the best person for the job!

336
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:19,188
If she says anything against
the Third and Fourth Hokage,

337
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,855
I'll wipe the floor with her.

338
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,588
Next time-- Unforgivable!

339
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:25,355
A Total Lack of Respect!
