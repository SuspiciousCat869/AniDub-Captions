00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:49,020
All of you showed a lot of
determination on this exam.

4
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,889
It wasn't an easy one.

5
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:58,464
Just one more thing-- I
congratulate you on passing.

6

-Huh?

7
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,342
-That's right,
you've all passed.

The first stage of your
Chunin Exam is done

on the next part of the test.

Believe it!

12

Believe it!

think that someone

20
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,789
would just pass in a
completely blank test paper.

ourselves a tough guy.

Are you tough enough

I thought this
forest was creepy,

but these guys
are even creepier.

I could do that with my tongue.

Sheesh, you're the one
who threw the kunai at me.

64
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,334
Now before we begin
this test, I have

65
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:35,836
something to hand
out to you all.

66
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,672
It's just a standard
consent form.

67
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,545
Before the test,
all of you are going

68
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,715
to have to read over this
form, and then sign it.

69

-What for?

70
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:50,620
-Some of you may not
come back from this test,

71
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:53,590
and I have to get your
consent to that risk.

72
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:56,159
Otherwise, it would
be my responsibility.

Now, I'll explain what
you'll be doing on this test.

00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:09,207
Here, pass these out.

77
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,775
The first thing
you need to know is

78
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:14,579
that this test will tax every
one of your survival skills.

79

Survival-- what a drag.

[yawn]

81
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:22,555
-First, I'll give
you all a description

82
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:25,158
of the terrain on
the practice field.

83
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:29,930
The 44th Battle Training Zone
has 44 locked entrance gates.

84
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:32,666
There are rivers
and a forest inside.

85
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,437
-In the center is a locked
tower, located 10 kilometers

86
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,740
from each gate.

87
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,742
It's in this confined
area that you'll

88
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,143
undergo the Survival Test.

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,621
The test consists of
an anything goes battle

90
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:55,458
to get your hands
on these scrolls.

91
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,893
-Both of them?

92
00:06:56,926 --> 00:07:01,130
ANKO: Yes, you'll be
fighting to get both a Heaven

93
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:03,133
Scroll and an Earth Scroll.

94
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:12,877
All together, 26 teams will
be taking part in this test.

95
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,046
So half of those
teams will be going

96
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,548
after the Heaven Scroll
and the other half

97
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,452
will be trying to
get the Earth Scroll.

98
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:23,022
I'll hand over one kind
of scroll to each team,

99
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:26,759
and that's what
you'll be vying for.

100
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,829
-OK, so how do we pass the test?

101
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:33,033
ANKO: Your entire squad must
bring both the Heaven and Earth

102
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,667
scroll to the tower.

103
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,937
-That means at the
very best, half of us

104
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,172
will fail-- more,
if not every team

105
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,974
is able to get both the scrolls.

106
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:43,211
-No one ever said
it would be easy.

107
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:46,981
Oh, and one more thing,
the test has a time limit.

108
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:49,283
You must finish it
within five days.

109
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,485
-Five days out there?

110
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,687
-What are we supposed
to do for food?

111
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,889
-Just look around.

112
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,758
The forest is full
of things to eat,

113
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,227
and there's plenty
to feed all of you.

114
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,032
-Yeah, but that's not all
the forest has plenty of.

115
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,235
There are man-eating beasts
and poisonous plants in there.

116
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,270
-Oh, man!

117
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:08,605
-Quiet down.

118
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,607
This is why they call
it "survival", you now.

119
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:13,010
-That means with
these circumstances

120
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:16,247
there's no way half the
teams will pass the test.

121
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,417
-With the days getting longer,
the nights are getting shorter.

122
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:23,388
So we will have less time to
sleep and less time to recover.

123
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,690
It is a challenge, indeed.

124
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,528
-Completely
surrounded by enemies,

125
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:30,763
there won't be time to rest.

126
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:32,565
We'll have to keep
a constant watch.

127
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,033
-Right.

128
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,970
This test also measures
endurance behind enemy lines.

129
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,339
This is designed to
be a grueling test,

130
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:42,542
and I'm sure some of you
won't be up to the challenge.

131
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:46,581
-So um, let's say mid
exam-- can we quit?

132
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:48,148
-Of course, not.

133
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:50,585
In the middle of a battle, you
can't say, "Sorry, I quit."

134
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,453
Well, I guess you
could, but it's probably

135
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,155
going to get you killed.

136
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,425
-Oh, just great.

137
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,827
This is going to be a drag.

138
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,064
-There are also some ways
you can get disqualified.

139
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:05,935
The first is simple-- if
all three members of a team

140
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:10,173
can't make it to the tower with
both scrolls after five days.

141
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:13,811
Number two-- if a team loses a
member or if a member becomes

142
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,381
incapacitated and
cannot continue.

143
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:21,052
But most important, none of
you-- absolutely none of you--

144
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,954
may look at the
contents of the scrolls

145
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,856
until you've reached the tower.

146
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,228
W- what if it just happens
to flap open and you read it?

147
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,430
-Let me put it to you
this way, young man,

148
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:34,433
you don't want to know.

149
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,768
--Naaa!

150
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,470
ANKO: There are times
when a ninja will

151
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,073
be asked to carry
secret documents.

152
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,509
The scroll rule is to
test your integrity.

153
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:44,911
OK, we're done.

154
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:46,680
Each team, take
your consent forms

155
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,150
and exchange them over
there for your scrolls.

156
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:54,522
After that, each team pick a
gate, and you'll be let inside.

157
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:56,324
[sigh]

158
00:09:56,358 --> 00:10:01,263
-Oh, and I have one more word
of advice-- just don't die!

159
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:01,864
-Hmph.

160
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:15,812
[whispering among the genin]

161
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:29,227
-(VOICEOVER) I see how it is, we
won't know which team has which

162
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,031
scroll, and we won't know which
of the team members is carrying

163
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:35,133
a scroll.

164
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,804
Stealing information is really
a matter of life and death.

165
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,846
It's just like Ibiki said.

166
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,817
[whispering among the genin]

167
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,153
-(VOICEOVER) Everyone is
equally determined to pass,

168
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,289
and all of them are my enemies.

169
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,961
-(VOICEOVER) Hm, it looks like
they're starting to understand

170
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,063
what's really
involved in this test.

171
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,602
INO: Well, well,
well, if it isn't

172
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:10,505
the little future failure.

173
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,241
What's up, billboard brow?

174
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:15,345
I thought you would have washed
out of the program by now.

175
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:18,048
Your big forehead alone,
should have gotten you tossed.

176
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:23,053
-So sad, you're jealous that I'm
spending five days with Sasuke.

177
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,888
And it's clearly
turning you into someone

178
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,723
very petty and ugly.

179
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,259
And you were already ugly .

180
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,427
[laughter]

181
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:32,764
-Grrr!

182
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:33,465
-Ugly!

183
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:34,232
-You are!

184
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:34,699
-Billboard brow!

185
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:35,567
-Ugly!

186
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,601
-Billboard forehead!

187
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,469
-Ugly!

188
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:38,136
-Billboard forehead!

189
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,804
-Ugly!

190
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:39,504
-Billboard forehead!

191
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:40,706
-Ugly!

192
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:41,574
-Enough!

193
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,075
Give it up, Sakura!

194
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,378
You and I both know you're
too weak to pass this test!

195
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,212
-Yeah, right!

196
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:47,413
You're the one who's going down!

197
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:51,150
[groans]

198
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:52,486
-Hmph!

199
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,953
[trembling]

200
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:55,955
-I'm glad they
didn't turn on us.

201
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,092
Why are they like
that to each other?

202
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:58,592
-Pffft!

203
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,894
Who cares?

204
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,295
Like I have time to
worry about that stuff.

205
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:11,306
-Huh?

206
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,510
What are you doing
all the way out here?

207
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:15,711
[gasp]

208
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:20,016
-Oh, Naruto, I um,
I just, nothing--

209
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,486
-(VOICEOVER) That's
Hinata, weird as always.

210
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,489
-I, uh, oh, you're cut.

211
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:29,259
Here, I have mist--

212
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,128
-Well, anyway, see you later.

213
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:39,538
-(VOICEOVER) Uh, I guess I'll
just keep it for later then.

214
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:40,805
-All right, everyone.

215
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,474
We're going to start
handing out scrolls.

216
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:57,157
-(VOICEOVER) I wonder if any
of them will survive this.

217
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:04,731
-(VOICEOVER) Ha!

218
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,400
We are so going to win this.

219
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,006
-Listen up.

220
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,308
All the teams have
received their scroll,

221
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:15,778
so everybody go to your
gate and wait there.

222
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:18,280
When the gates open,
the test is on!

223
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,495
-Yahoo!

224
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,097
We rock at survival.

225
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,398
There's no way we can lose.

226
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:38,235
Hinata, you'd better
be strong for this.

227
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,604
-Right.

228
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:42,974
SHIKAMARU: The test might cost
us our lives-- what a drag.

229
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,742
But since we have
to do it, let's

230
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,444
just go after Naruto first.

231
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:47,445
-Burrito?

232
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:48,013
Check.

233
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:48,947
Potato chips?

234
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,848
Check.

235
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:50,982
Strawberry layered cake?

236
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:52,918
Yeah, yeah!

237
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,086
-Believe it!

238
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,055
I dare you to
bring it on, ninja.

239
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:59,258
I'll just send it right
back-- twice as hard!

240
00:13:59,292 --> 00:13:59,792
-Oooh!

241
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:01,261
Ooh.

242
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:01,828
-Sia!

243
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,462
That's right!

244
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,972
--[chuckling] The time has
come to carry out our orders

245
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,141
in the open.

246
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,616
-(VOICEOVER) Not only do I
have to deal with the punks

247
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,853
on the other teams,
I'll be with Gaara,

248
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,487
and he might try to kill me.

249
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:31,061
-We'll target the rookies--
they're easy prey.

250
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:33,529
-We'll get their scroll
from them in no time.

251
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:37,033
Anything goes, right?

252
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,602
-Sensei, I will make you proud.

253
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:44,976
Just watch, soon everyone
will know the name Rock Lee.

254
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,146
[clock ticking]

255
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,258
-All right, heads
up, you maggots!

256
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,460
The second part of
the test has begun!

257
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,866
-You know who we're looking for.

258
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,769
-Yeah, those three brats.

259
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:10,737
-Hee, hee, hee.

260
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,106
We're all right!

261
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,273
Here we go, guys!

262
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:20,982
-Ugh.

263
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:21,582
-Ugh.

264
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,717
-Ugh.

265
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:26,254
-OK, first thing we've
got to do is to find it.

266
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,723
Are you ready, Hinata?

267
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:28,324
-Mhm.

268
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:32,561
Byakugan!

269
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,133
NEJI: Take it easy, Lee.

270
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,569
The test has only just begun.

271
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:45,308
-That may be, but still,
whoever our enemies are,

272
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,780
I want to find them
before they find us.

273
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:51,615
-You hot-blooded fool.

274
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,387
-We have only one target--
stay focused on it.

275
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:10,770
-Ah!

276
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,637
Are you kidding?

277
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,274
What are you doing?

278
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,310
-I'm just having a snack.

279
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,280
I mean, I've got to keep
my strength up, don't I?

280
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,216
-We haven't even been
out here five minutes!

281
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:25,653
-Yeah, now come on Choji,
we have a job to do here.

282
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:26,821
-I can't help it.

283
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,790
I've got to eat-- they're
my favorite flavor.

284
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,458
-You and your snacks.

285
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,360
This is a survival
test, you know.

286
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:35,798
You should have packed
more kunai and less candy.

287
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:36,699
[gasp]

288
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,734
-You guys, quick-- hide!

289
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:39,368
-Ugh.

290
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,221
Huuh!

291
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:43,673
-Ugh.

292
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:44,273
-Ugh.

293
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:49,213
-(VOICEOVER) Oh, no.

294
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:54,552
-Huh!

295
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:55,474
Oh!

296
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,629
[sigh of relief]

297
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:06,432
-(VOICEOVER) Aw, man, I've got
to deal with five more days

298
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:07,354
of this?

299
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,846
KIBA: So if the tower
is where everyone's

300
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:22,850
going to be headed in the end,
I say, we lay a trap near it

301
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:25,519
and just take the scrolls
off whoever we catch.

302
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:26,454
-Grrr.

303
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:30,024
-Well, well, we've got company.

304
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:30,625
-Hm?

305
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,496
-Ha!

306
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,931
Bunch of fools, just
standing out in the open

307
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:38,367
like they want to get caught.

308
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,036
-Well, it seems that
they've sensed our presence,

309
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,073
but they're all such lame
ninja that they can't even

310
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,675
pinpoint our location.

311
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,342
Ugh.

312
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,377
-Hey, what's wrong?

313
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,611
What's in your shirt?

314
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,885
-Oh, what is that thing?

315
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:55,886
-Ah!

316
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,888
Oh!

317
00:17:56,921 --> 00:18:01,258
[screaming]

318
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,795
KIBA: Well, it looks like
the leeches found them.

319
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:06,031
They sense body temperature
and perspiration

320
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:08,934
and then in a group, they
swoop down on their prey.

321
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:14,240
If they suck your blood for
five minutes, it's all over.

322
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:15,841
These predators are smart.

323
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:20,980
We've taken advantage of their
instincts to trap our enemies.

324
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:23,450
-Get off me!

325
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:24,784
Huh?

326
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:28,188
[screaming]

327
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:29,824
-There's one team down.

328
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:33,328
[screaming]

329
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,604
--[chuckling] Sounds
like the fun has begun.

330
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,640
-Aaaagh!

331
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,343
-That sounded like
someone screaming.

332
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:52,949
[birds chattering]

333
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:55,685
-I do not like this place.

334
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,920
-Oh, come on.

335
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:58,121
It's nothing to be scared of.

336
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,623
It's going to be
a piece of cake.

337
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,663
Excuse me a second, I've
really got to you know--

338
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:06,965
-Yeah, right!

339
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:07,966
Get out of here!

340
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,133
What is this, a kennel?

341
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:10,301
Not in front of me you don't!

342
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,871
Find a bush or something!

343
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:13,872
NARUTO: Ah.

344
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:14,373
Mmm.

345
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:15,875
Ah, yeah.

346
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:16,842
Wooh!

347
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:17,843
Ah.

348
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:20,179
Aw man, that was a lot.

349
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:22,114
I wrote my whole name.

350
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,516
-You are such a pig!

351
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,986
You're really disgusting
sometimes, you know that?

352
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:26,920
-Augh!

353
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:27,821
-Huh?

354
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:30,424
-Du yaah!

355
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,459
-Sasuke, it wasn't that bad.

356
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,862
Don't you think you're
going a little overboard?

357
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,998
-Yeah, what the heck
was that all about?

358
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:37,999
Augh!

359
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,567
Ugh!

360
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:40,935
Ya!

361
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:43,238
Du ya!

362
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:43,838
Ugh!

363
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,145
You'd better watch out, Sakura,
I think he's gone crazy!

364
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:51,980
-Yeah, you wish.

365
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:53,816
I just struck before you could.

366
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,451
-Sasuke, no!

367
00:19:55,484 --> 00:20:00,056
-All right, then-- bring it on!

368
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,591
Ugh!

369
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,960
Du!

370
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,863
Ya!

371
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:06,864
Ya!

372
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,567
Ugh!

373
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,137
-Sasuke, what are you doing?

374
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,872
-Take a good look at him.

375
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,742
-Huh?

376
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:17,576
-Talk!

377
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,611
What have you done with Naruto?

378
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:20,646
[gasp]

379
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,280
-What?

380
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:21,981
What do you mean?

381
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,182
I am Naruto.

382
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:24,851
-Then where's the
cut on your cheek?

383
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,686
[gasp]

384
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,787
-Huh?

385
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,789
-I guess you didn't
know the real Naruto got

386
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:32,259
a cut on his face
before this test.

387
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,127
You also have your
shuriken holster

388
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,296
on your left leg,
not your right.

389
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:39,967
But the real Naruto
is right-handed.

390
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,237
Your transformation skill
is worse than Naruto's.

391
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:46,941
Tell me who you are!

392
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,209
-All right, you got me.

393
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:49,411
So what?

394
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:50,612
I'm still going to
take your scroll.

395
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:52,747
Now hand it over, or else.

396
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,688
So, which one of you has it?

397
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,162
Hmph!

398
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:09,266
Fine then, I guess I'll just
have to take you both out!

399
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,980
[theme music]

400
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,214
-That guy's going to
pay for what he did.

401
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,117
I mean, sneaking up on a guy
while he's-- it's just not

402
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:57,219
right.

403
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,686
Of course, even after
we're done with him,

404
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,055
we've got plenty
to keep us busy.

405
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,125
Vicious ninja, a giant
snake, and five days

406
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,728
of non-stop tension on this
ninja-fighting, scroll-hunting,

407
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,296
leech-filled survival test!

408
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,166
Oh man, I could use a vacation.

409
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:14,456
-Next time-- Eat or Be
Eaten-- Panic in the Forest.

410
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:15,423
Wait, what?

411
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,623
That's not cool.

412
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,923
I don't like the
sound of that at all!
