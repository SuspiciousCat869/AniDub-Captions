1
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:15,423
-Tad-ah!

2
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:17,659
[laughs]

3
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,729
So you know what time it is?

4
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,698
Golden time!

5
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:23,067
That's right.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,536
Starting tonight, in
fact, starting right now,

7
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,105
"Naruto" moves to
a brand-new time,

8
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:28,342
every Wednesday night at 7:27.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,276
-Hey, excuse me, boss.

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:30,611
-This is your lucky day!

11
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:31,780
I mean, night.

12
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,516
Whether you're a longtime
devoted fan or just

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,686
tuning in for the
very first time.

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,690
So now, here to get
the party started

15
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,560
is our brand-new theme song.

16
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:42,997
-I'm trying to
tell you something!

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,200
-Jeez, Konohamaru,
what's your problem?

18
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,370
Can't you see the
show is starting?

19
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,405
-Psst.

20
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:50,675
(WHISPERS) It's only
7 o'clock, Naruto.

21
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,442
-Huh?

22
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:53,312
-You're 27 minutes early.

23
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,817
This is actually the time slot
for the "Prince of Tennis."

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,652
-Oh, great!

25
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:58,219
Now, you tell me?

26
00:00:58,252 --> 00:00:59,088
What a disaster!

27
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,189
What are we going to do?

28
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,224
I already told everybody!

29
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:02,092
-Don't look at me.

30
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,594
-I can't just, ugh!

31
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:04,295
Ahh!

32
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:05,697
The hell with it.

33
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,804
So without further
ado, it's "Naruto."

34
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,672
-Hey, Sakura, Sasuke!

35
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:15,077
Don't look now, but Naruto
just went and opened the show.

36
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:15,979
You guys ready?

37
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,014
SAKURA: No way!

38
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,717
I still have my facial mask on.

39
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,818
Stall them!

40
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:22,288
-Do we even have the
video for this episode?

41
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,058
-No, it hasn't arrived yet.

42
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:25,327
-Terrific.

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,029
Well, I guess I could
do my ninja dance.

44
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,399
But I was saving
that for next season.

45
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:31,336
On second thought,
I'll go get the video.

46
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,171
You guys will have to fill time.

47
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:34,140
-What?

48
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:34,907
-Think of it as a mission.

49
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,376
You can do it.

50
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,010
-Hm.

51
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:38,747
A "mission," huh?

52
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,781
Since you put it that way.

53
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:40,783
-Yes!

54
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,886
Just leave it to us, Sensei.

55
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,221
-"Yes," huh?

56
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:46,123
You are the one who got
us into this, you idiot!

57
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,660
You and your big mouth!

58
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:50,998
Sometimes, I just want to--
in fact, I think I'll do it!

59
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,934
-[groans]

60
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,236
-Oh, that's good.

61
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,872
Keep it up.

62
00:01:55,905 --> 00:02:00,379
[theme music]

63
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,079
-Whoa, nice place.

64
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,649
What is it?

65
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,499
-This is the location for
the second phase of the exam.

66
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:48,472
It's the 44th Battle
Training Zone.

67
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:53,346
But we call it the
Forest of Death.

68
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,919
-The Forest of Death?

69
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:01,859
[rustling]

70
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:02,460
Hm?

71
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,932
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Fake rocks?

72
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,502
What's up with that?

73
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,753
-Uh!

74
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:23,056
[panting]

75
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,645
That's the worst
disguise of all time.

76
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,548
There's no such things
as square rocks.

77
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,484
It's completely obvious.

78
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,954
KID: You saw through
my camouflage again!

79
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,056
You're slick, boss.

80
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:49,062
Just what I'd expect
from my greatest rival.

81
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:49,663
-Haah!

82
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:56,072
[coughing]

83
00:04:56,105 --> 00:05:00,546
-I think we used a little
too much gunpowder, you guys.

84
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,147
KIDS: Huh?

85
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:07,289
-I'm Moegi, the sassiest
kunoichi in preschool.

86
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,524
Check me out!

87
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,093
-I love algebra.

88
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,495
Call me Udon.

89
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:14,066
-And I'm the number 1
ninja in the village.

90
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,835
Konohamaru!

91
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,805
And when we're all together--

92
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:21,743
KIDS: --we're the
Konohamaru Ninja Squad!

93
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,114
-Yeah, I knew it was
you guys the whole time.

94
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,649
What do you losers want?

95
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,486
I'm getting ready to take the
second phase of the Chunin

96
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,021
Exam, and you're
interrupting me.

97
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:32,159
I don't have any time to be
playing around with you guys

98
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:33,361
now.

99
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:34,596
-We didn't come to
play around, boss.

100
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,165
We're on official business.

101
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,434
-Yeah, that's right.

102
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,136
We came here for an
exclusive interview.

103
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,105
-Uh-huh.

104
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,106
Uh-huh.

105
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,376
-An interview, huh?

106
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,712
-We're here on
assignment to write

107
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,314
an article for the
academy's newspaper.

108
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,985
It's a big-time feature story,
all about the Chunin Selection

109
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,387
Examinations.

110
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,827
-So that's why we want to do an
exclusive interview with you.

111
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,697
Please tell us you're
going to do it?

112
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,066
-It would mean a lot.

113
00:05:59,099 --> 00:05:59,900
-Humph.

114
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,471
Yeah, but right now, [grunts]

115
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,073
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Hey, you over there!

116
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,042
-Huh?

117
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,243
FEMALE SPEAKER:
What are you doing?

118
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:07,078
You're holding up the exams.

119
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:08,112
-Uh, sorry.

120
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:09,649
But Konohamaru was
telling me something

121
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:12,185
about an interview for
the academy newspaper.

122
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,387
-[gasp]

123
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,490
Oh, yeah, I forgot all about it.

124
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:16,925
Lord Hokage had
mentioned something

125
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,495
about them interviewing me.

126
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,197
-Uhh, interviewing you?

127
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,267
-All right, we're taking
a 10-minute break.

128
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,436
For those that are
scheduled to be interviewed,

129
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,873
please be courteous
and respectful

130
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:28,209
to reporters from the
academy newspaper.

131
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:31,180
-I thought I was the only
one being interviewed?

132
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,015
-No, boss.

133
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,717
But you are the most important.

134
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,687
-Oh, well, in that
case, I'll give you

135
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,756
an interview that'll make
it clear to your readers

136
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,759
why I'm the greatest ninja ever!

137
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:46,970
"Special Report, Live
from the Forest of Death."

138
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:53,113
KONOHAMARU: "Naruto and
the Rest of Squad 7."

139
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,618
All right, boss, first tell us
a little bit about yourself.

140
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:57,786
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): OK.

141
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,425
-Believe it.

142
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

143
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:05,097
I like instant ramen in a cup.

144
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:06,934
And I really like the
ramen Iruka-sensei

145
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,871
got me at the
Ichiraku Noodle Shop.

146
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,741
My hobby is eating
different kinds of ramen

147
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,143
and comparing them.

148
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:15,346
And my future dream is to
be the greatest Hokage!

149
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,549
Then the whole village
will stop disrespecting me

150
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:21,588
and start treating me like I'm
somebody-- somebody important.

151
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,392
No other Genin can
match any of my jutsu.

152
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:27,764
Even Iruka-sensei can't
help being impressed.

153
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,533
-Congratulations.

154
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,869
You graduate.

155
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:32,471
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): And
now that I'm in Squad 7,

156
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,876
I get to prove it by going on
dangerous missions every day.

157
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,747
-What's your distance
from the target?

158
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,283
-5 meters.

159
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:41,250
I'm ready.

160
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:43,087
Just give the signal.

161
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,455
-I'm ready, too.

162
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,392
-So am I.

163
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,661
-Now!

164
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:49,296
-Ugh!

165
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:49,830

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The
other Genin in Squad 7

176
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,083
are Sasuke and Sakura.

177
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,685
But since I'm really
the only one that

178
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,523
shows any kind of promise, you
don't need to hear about them.

179
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,758
KONOHAMARU: Well, do it anyway.

180
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,060
You know, for the article?

181
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:11,796
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): OK, OK.

182
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,001
Sasuke Uchiha is a
real pretentious guy.

183
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,302
All the girls think he's cool.

184
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:20,375
But they don't realize
how big a jerk he is.

185
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:21,845
-Close, really close.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Anyway, he's always

187
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,817
swooping in at the last
minute and making me look bad.

188
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,987
But one day, I'll show him.

189
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,556
There's also Sakura Haruno.

190
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,492
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

191
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,161
She's madly in love with me.

192
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:34,997
She'd never admit it, of course.

193
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,169
But I think her coyness
just makes her even cuter.

194
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:40,138
-That's it!

195
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:40,806

00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:49,251
Aw, what kind of
girlfriend are you?

198
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,019
-Get real!

199
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,123
In your dreams, buddy!

KONOHAMARU: It
doesn't sound to me

202
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:55,961
like she's in love
with you, boss.

203
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,831
NARUTO: (SARCASTIC) Ha-ha-ha.

204
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,667
Very funny, Konohamaru.

205
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,704
But trust me, she is.

206
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:04,073
Anyway, putting that
aside, our squad

207
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,277
is a well-oiled machine
that can succeed

in any mission, no
matter how dangerous.

Oh, hi, lady.

214
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:16,959
I got rid of all your weeds.

Pretty cool, huh?

Uh, what's wrong?

-You pulled the weeds.

218
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,272
And you also pulled
up my plants.

-Huh?

220
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:29,077
WOMAN: Those were special
herbs I've been growing.

Not there!

go the other way.

want to talk about?

KONOHAMARU (VOICEOVER):
My name is Konohamaru.

266
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:07,190
I'm the grandson of
the Third Hokage.

267
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:09,560
That means he's the
top ninja in town.

268
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,130
The Fourth Hokage
was the greatest hero

269
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:13,499
this village has ever known.

270
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:16,470
He protected our home
from the Nine-Tailed Fox.

271
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,642
And he's still
revered to this day.

-What's the matter, huh?

I thought you were going
to hit me, tough guy.

274
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,383
Afraid because the Third
Hokage is my grandfather?

-I don't care if he's
your grandmother!

Believe it!

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,126
-Uh!

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Don't
forget Iruka-sensei.

00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:33,830
He was the only one
who is nice to me.

280
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:36,133
And I sure did drive him crazy.

00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,804
Me, Naruto, the next Hokage.

282

A ninja legend!

00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:44,712
Then everyone will have
to stop disrespecting me

284
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,948
and look up to me.

285
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:46,915

00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:57,431
-Why would you do that
to the Hokage faces?

00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:58,132
-Got you!

can't be about you, boss.

293
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:07,513
-Oh, I guess you're
right, Konohamaru.

294
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,983
I suppose I could tell you
a few stories about how

295
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,218
Sasuke screwed up.

296
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,454
-I've already heard
that story, boss.

297
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:16,359
Can't you talk about
anyone but you?

298
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,896
-I'm sure Naruto is just
talking about himself

299
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,098
over there with those kids.

300
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:22,001
I'll bet he never
even mentions us.

301
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,405
-Hm, that would
be just like him.

302
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:30,346
-The incredibly
cool Kakashi here.

303
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,816
What's the situation?

304
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,218
-The lovely Sakura here.

305
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,721
We've been letting the
idiotic Naruto fill time.

306
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,358
-So how are things
going on your end?

307
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,861
Are we going to have it in time?

308
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:41,196
-Oh, don't worry.

309
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,067
At the pace I'm going,
everything will be OK.

310
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,103
I should be there with
the video by the end

311
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:47,539
of the next commercial break.

312
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:48,907
I hope.

313
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,778
-Well, you better be.

314
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:53,748
-Kakashi-sensei?

315
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,083
Yoo-hoo!

316
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,585
Are you there?

317
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:58,989
Well, what are we
going to do now?

318
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,993
It's the end of the commercial
break, and he's not back yet.

319
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,395
-I guess it looks
like you're just

320
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,466
going to have to fill
the time, Sakura.

321
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:06,167
-Me?

322
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,802
Why do I have to do it?

323
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,237
-Yeah, go for it, Sakura!

324
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:13,110
-I'd shut up if I were
you, you little-- OK, fine!

325
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,781
I will, since I guess
I have no choice.

Tell us about Sakura Haruno.

00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,803
She's got what it takes
to be a top female ninja.

330
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:34,174
-Notice the interplay between
physical and spiritual power.

331
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,643
That's the key.

332
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:40,250
Finally, the hand signs
focus and unleash the chakra.

333
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:41,419
-Transform.

334
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,821
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Moegi, if you

335
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,225
want to know the truth
about Naruto, talk to me.

336
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,127
I'll tell you about
his different ninjutsu

337
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,096
without all the bragging.

338
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,767
First, there's his Sexy Jutsu.

339
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,337
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

340
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,672
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Shadow clones?

341
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:57,443
Who can handle
that many Narutos.

342
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,746
There's also his Harem Jutsu.

343
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,148
-Transform!

344
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,751
NARUTO CLONES: Transform!

345
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:04,119
Transform!

346
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:07,123
[girl clones giggling]

347
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:09,126
-[whimpers]

348
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,129
[girl clones giggling]

349
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:13,733
-Aah!

350
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,437
[groans]

351
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:19,141
-Got you with my Harem Jutsu.

352
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,643
[snickers]

353
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,346
-Naruto!

354
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,383
-That's what he gets
for coming late.

355
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,718
Surprise!

356
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,487
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): But
most of the time, Naruto

357
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,191
is just being Naruto.

358
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:34,397
[sighs] Huh?

359
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:37,769
Which is not a good thing.

360
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:41,141
What I really want to talk
about is the number 1 rookie,

361
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:42,610
Sasuke Uchiha.

362
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:45,981
Not only did he graduate as
the academy's top student,

363
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,819
but he's also the most
popular guy in class.

364
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:52,024
He can even hold his
own with Kakashi-sensei.

365
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,227
I mean, he's so cool.

366
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,462
Oh, my!

367
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,800
I think I'm going
to faint. [giggles]

368
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:14,723
-There's no point
using normal attacks.

369
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:16,125
-[grunts]

370
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:16,726
-A trap!

371
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:21,734
What?

372
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:22,854
-Eyah!

373
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:26,675
Haah!

374
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:34,219
-This kid.

375
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:42,431
-Horse, Tiger Fire Style!

376
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,201
Fireball Jutsu!

377
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:44,802
-What?

378
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:45,503
Can he?

379
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:46,470
He can't do fire jutsu.

380
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:48,373
It takes too much chakra.

381
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,209
There's no way!

382
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,068
-Demon Wind Shuriken!

383
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,572
Windmill of Shadows!

384
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:10,841
-A shuriken?

385
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:12,810
He'll never touch me with that.

386
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,817
-Aah!

387
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,558
I've been waiting
to try this out.

388
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,559
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Huh!

389
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,128
Could it be?

390
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:26,697
Is it a Sharingan?

391
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:32,038
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): So
that is the Sharingan.

392
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,344
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Uhh, you'll never

393
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,314
know what Sasuke will do next.

394
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,316
He's amazing!

395
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,190
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Genjutsu or ninjutsu.

396
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:48,129
Whatever magic he's
using, I'll see it now!

397
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,552
-[grunts]

398
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,121
I can't get loose.

399
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:05,722
-Uhh.

400
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:10,662
-[grunts]

401
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:23,682
NARUTO: Your tribute
to the great Sasuke

402
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,317
is putting everyone
to sleep, Sakura.

403
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:26,619
SAKURA: Quiet, Naruto.

404
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:27,220
NARUTO: Ugh!

405
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,722
Ow!

406
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,325
-Oh, admit it, Sasuke!

407
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,396
You care about me!

408
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,800
-I, uh, guess that's true.

409
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,803
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I
can't keep up with Sasuke.

410
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,206
I can't even beat Naruto.

411
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,976
I'll never pass these exams.

412
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,983
Let me tell you
about our sensei,

413
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:50,254
Kakashi Hatake, also
known as the Copy Ninja.

414
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:54,394
He uses his Sharingan eye to
assess the enemy's technique

415
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:56,530
and then copy it in an instant.

416
00:17:56,563 --> 00:18:06,078
He's copied over 1,000 jutsu.

417
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,381
But he's always
reading his dumb book.

418
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,152
And whenever he's supposed to
meet us early in the morning,

419
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,487
he's always late.

420
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:15,992
Plus, like everyone else, Naruto
really gets on his nerves.

421
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:16,961
-Huh!

422
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,031
-Leaf Village
Secret Finger Jutsu!

423
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,366
-Naah!

424
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,568
[thump]

425
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,602
[groans]

426
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,505
-A Thousand Years of Death!

427
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,013
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): But
the biggest mystery of all

428
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:33,618
is his face hidden
under that mask.

429
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:36,189
I wonder what he
really looks like.

430
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:46,838
-Ninja Art, Summoning Earth
Style Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!

431
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,031
-Aargh!

432
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:07,703
-I realized if I couldn't see
you, I'd have to smell you out.

433
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:09,772
That was a summoning jutsu.

434
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,042
I was calling forth
my ninja hounds

435
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:16,649
that can track a scent anywhere.

436
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,619
Ah, the mist is
finally clearing.

437
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:21,223
And you know what I see?

438
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,026
Your corpse.

439
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,429
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
I wonder, why is it

440
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:28,634
only his left eye have
the Sharingan power?

441
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,072
I thought it was an inherited
trait exclusive to the Uchiha

442
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:32,706
clan.

443
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,111
-Lightning Blade!

444
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:39,016
-His chakra is so
strong, it's visible!

445
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,553
He holds it in his hand.

446
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,362
-I won't allow you
to kill Tazuna.

447
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,331
-Ah, fool.

448
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,268
Water Prison Jutsu!

449
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:51,869
-No!

450
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,908
-Secret Jutsu.

451
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:05,889
-[gasp]

452
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:07,525
-Crystal Ice Mirrors!

453
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,928
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): There
are plenty of other ninjutsu

454
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:12,032
that other ninja can do as well.

455
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:14,435
In fact, there are so many
different types and styles

456
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,505
that I don't have the
time to explain them

457
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,976
all in this short interview.

458
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,884
UDON: "Rival Ninja."

459
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:25,752
Boy, Sasuke!

460
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:26,921
You're the coolest.

461
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:28,155
When I look at you,
I feel like I'm

462
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:29,925
looking at my future
self. [chuckles]

463
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,728
Do you mind if I get
a few quotes from you

464
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,130
for our article?

465
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,900
-Well, I guess I ought to
set the record straight.

466
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,070
If you listen to
Naruto, your article

467
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,073
will be more fairy
tale than truth.

468
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,009
-Oh, no, you don't, Sasuke.

469
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:44,847
They came here to
interview me, not you.

470
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,852
-They came here to
interview everyone, loser.

471
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,988
There are other
ninja here, you know.

472
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:51,357
Believe it!

473
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,725
-[grunts]

474
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,927
-[grunts]

475
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,864
-The article's about me!

476
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:58,167
-Nobody cares about you, Naruto.

477
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,336
All you do is goof off
and get in trouble.

478
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,940
That's why you'll
never be a real ninja.

479
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:04,276
-Oh, yeah?

480
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,077
-Yeah.

481
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,379
Don't you remember anything?

482
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:07,447
Hey, you!

483
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:08,983
Identify yourself.

484
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:11,653
The guy with the
gourd on his back.

485
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,792
-My name is Gaara of the Desert.

486
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,496
I'm curious about you, too.

487
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:18,964
Who are you?

488
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,334
-I am Sasuke Uchiha.

489
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:21,835
-Hey, you.

490
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:22,669
Over here.

491
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:23,905
What's your name?

492
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:24,772
I want to know.

493
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,175
-Hm?

494
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:26,943
Rrrh!

495
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:27,911
Again?

496
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:30,281
It's always about Sasuke!

497
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:33,019
-It's common courtesy to give
your own name before asking

498
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:36,056
someone else's.

499
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:38,727
BOY: Hey, you with the attitude.

500
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,696
Hold on!

501
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,297
ALL: Huh?

502
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,907
-I want to fight, right
here and right now.

503
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,576
-I get him first.

504
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,878
This weirdo is mine.

505
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:52,280
-No, thank you.

506
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:55,318
Right now, the only one I
want to fight is Uchiha.

507
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:56,119
-Yeah?

508
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:57,688
Well, I've got news for you.

509
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:00,059
Sasuke can't compare to me.

510
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:00,660
Believe it!

511
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:01,661
Aah!

512
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:05,633
[grunts]

513
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,603
Aah!

514
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:10,607
Ugh!

515
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:11,976
-Leaf Whirlwind!

516
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,577
-Aah!

517
00:22:15,982 --> 00:22:19,053
[groans]

518
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,555
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
The students taking

519
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,926
the Chunin Exams are
all highly skilled.

520
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,295
And every one of
them is considered

521
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:27,399
to be the cream of the
crop, except for Naruto.

522
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,667
NARUTO: Hey!

523
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,839
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Shikamaru
Nara, Choji Akimichi,

524
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:38,682
Ino Yamanaka, Hinata Hyuga,
Kiba Inuzuka with Akamaru,

525
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:40,652
and Shino Aburame.

526
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:43,323
Each one of them is talented
in their own unique way.

527
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:46,093
But I'm still better than
all of them combined.

528
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,429
NARUTO: Yeah, right.

529
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:49,398
That's why you got your
butt kicked by Rock Lee

530
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:51,000
because you're better than him?

531
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,236
You shouldn't be talking.

532
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:54,439
Even you screwed up
from time to time.

533
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,942
SASUKE: I'm going
to screw you up

534
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,610
if you don't watch it, Naruto.

535
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,612
NARUTO: Go for it!

536
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:00,414
Let's settle this
once and for all.

537
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:01,951
SAKURA: Guys, will you cool it?

538
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:05,389
Listen, we passed the first
phase of the Chunin Exam.

539
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:07,259
And we're about to enter
the Forest of Death

540
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,127
for the second phase.

541
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,097
I don't know what's
waiting for us in there.

542
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,668
But no matter what lies
ahead, we won't be afraid.

543
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:16,773
And we'll pass the
exam to become Chunin

544
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:20,111
because Kakashi-sensei
taught us to work as a team.

545
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:22,081
And nothing can break that bond.

546
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,415
Right, guys?

547
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:25,652
-Yeah, I guess your right.

548
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:26,653
-Teamwork, right.

549
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:39,206
-We really want to
thank all of you.

550
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,009
That was a great interview.

551
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:42,311
-Yeah, thanks.

552
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:45,215
-Knock them dead on
the Chunin Exam, boss.

553
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,049
-Don't worry, guys.

554
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:47,584
We'll make it.

555
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:48,052
KIDS: See you!

556
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:48,820
Bye!

557
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:49,487
See you later!

558
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,055
Bye!

559
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:50,523
You're the best!

560
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:55,530
-Hey, guys!

561
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:56,498
Sorry I'm late.

562
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:58,601
I bumped into a very
cute young lady.

563
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:01,439
And naturally, she wanted
to go dancing with me.

564
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,375
-(IN UNISON) Yeah right!

565
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,110
-You don't believe me?

566
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,012
Humph.

567
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,348
Anyway, I got the video.

568
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:09,183
Do I, at least, get
some thanks for that?

569
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,786
-Way to go, Kakashi-sensei!

570
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,488
Better late than never.

571
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,792
OK, let's start the show, huh?

572
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,828
-Right, after this
commercial message.

573
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,758
-Aah! [groans]

574
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,605
[music - Rythem, "Harmonia"]

575
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,574
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The
44th Battle Training Zone,

576
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:57,812
also known as the
Forest of Death.

577
00:25:57,845 --> 00:26:00,916
From here on, it's a serious
battle between the ninja.

578
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:03,119
Anything could happen.

579
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:04,955
[laughs] Oh, yeah!

580
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,825
This is getting interesting.

581
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,462
A life-threatening survival
game in the forest.

582
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:12,199
I'm going to come out on top.

583
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:17,001
Next time, "The Chunin Exam,
Stage 2-- the Forest of Death."

584
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:20,468
I'm going to shine once again.
