-This guy.

00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,972
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
This isn't going

4
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,672
to be easy as long as
he stays like this.

5
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:16,872
But I have no choice.

6
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,039
Gotta save my friends.

7
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:26,006
It's all up to me.

8
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,306
Light Versus Dark, The
Two Faces of Gaara.

[laughter]

00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:46,739
-And that's exactly
why you can't win.

11
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,739
As long as you fight
for the sake of others,

12
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:53,706
you'll never advance
beyond this level.

13
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,206
Only one can remain
undefeated, and only he

14
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,106
will feel what it's
like to truly exist.

15
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,939
Forget your friends,
and fight for yourself.

16
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,472
-You're insane.

17
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:08,539
Forget my friends?

18
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,372
-The trivial feelings like
friendship and loyalty

19
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:17,306
cloud your focus,
and you'll die.

20
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:19,739
-Yeah, yeah, keep
talking while you can,

21
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:23,172
cuz I'm about to shut
you up once and for all.

22
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,039
-You don't understand
what real strength is.

23
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:31,506

00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:26,172
Why, Yashimaru?

27
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,806
Why did you do it?

28
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,272
I don't understand.

29
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:36,806
Tell me why.

30
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,539
-Love is the heart's desire to
serve someone precious to you.

31
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,672
To watch over them.

32
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:45,606
To care for them, like
my sister did for you.

33

[sobbing]

34
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,839
After all, you're
special, Gaara.

35
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:55,606
I hold you very dear to me.

36
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:02,106
-I thought, Yashimaru,
if I'm precious to you--

37
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:02,839
how could you?

38
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,472
-It was an order.

39
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:10,206
You see.

40
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,739
I was ordered to
kill you, Gaara.

41
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:19,439
By lord Kazekage, your father.

42
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,306
-My father?

[sobbing]

44
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,006
Why me?

45
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,639
Why would my father?

46
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,706
YASHIMARU: You were born with
the Shukaku, a living sand

47
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,806
spirit, inside you.

48
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,372
All these years you have
been watched and studied

49
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:49,039
as part of a great experiment.

50
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,139
It became clear
that you could never

51
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:55,939
control it, the Shukaku that
possesses the power of the sand

52
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,772
itself.

53
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,506
The day is coming when
your existence would

54
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,106
be too dangerous
for the village.

55
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,372
It had to be done before then.

56
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:12,772
-You-- you had to
obey my father.

57
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,472
You didn't have any choice.

58
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,706
-You're wrong.

59
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:21,206
I had a choice.

60
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,306
Yes.

61
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,839
Lord Kazekage made his
wishes known to me,

62
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:28,539
but I could have refused
if I had chosen to.

63
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:38,972
I suppose it's because deep in
my heart, I hate you, Gaara.

64
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,906
I've always hated you.

65
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,506
My sister died bringing
you into this world.

66
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,739
I can't forgive you for that.

67
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:52,939
I told myself that you were
all that was left of her.

68
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:56,606
And since I loved her,
I should love you.

69
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,572
I tried, but I never could.

70
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,272
It wasn't her
choice to have you,

71
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,306
to be made a human sacrifice.

72
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:11,106
And so she died
cursing this village.

73
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,472
The day she died, I
felt a wound in my heart

74
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:18,206
that I knew would never heal.

75
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,339
-Unlike an injury
to the body, there's

76
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:25,372
no medicine for a wounded heart,
and sometimes it never heals.

77
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,639
-A wound to the heart?

78
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:34,172
-Your name is the one
your mother gave you.

79
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:41,939
Your name is Gaara, the
demon that loves only itself,

80
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:45,339
as you must love no one else.

81
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:48,372
Care for no one's
existence but your own.

82
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:51,606
Fight only for yourself.

83
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,772
In that way you will
be sure to survive.

84
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:58,172
This is the dying gift
your mother left you,

85
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:01,539
but not out of
maternal affection.

86
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:04,472
It was not from love that
she gave you your name.

87
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,939
It was from her undying
rage at this village.

88
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:17,772
It was part of her curse that
you should survive and grow.

89
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:20,406
[whimper]

90
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,439
Her hate lives on in you.

91
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,439
You were never loved, Gaara.

92
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:42,939
Never.

93
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,106
But now, this is the end.

sister and always loved you.

[crying]

97
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:42,372
The sand automatically
rushes to protect you,

98
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,306
just like the love of a mother.

99
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,706
I believe your mother's
will is carried

100
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:50,472
in every grain of that sand.

It's love, Gaara.

103

YASHIMARU: Love no one else.

104
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:49,272
Care for no one's
existence for your own.

105
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:52,106
Fight only for yourself.

106
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,939
-So that's Gaara.

107
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:56,339
Me.

108
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:59,339
I understand now.

109
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:01,339
I'm alone.

110
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:06,772
I'll no longer care about
anyone and love anyone else.

111
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:08,272
I'm all alone.

112
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:15,706
I am all that matters.

Why don't you attack?

Don't you care what happens

Why's he hesitating?

to save Sakura no matter what!

125
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,006
But how?

00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,339
That's it!

127
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:07,806
This is gonna use up a
heck of a lot of chakra,

128
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,406
but it's time to bring
in the Chief Toad!

What do you want, kid?

Well, whatever it is, I hope
you brought along some treats.

134
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,039
Cuz of you think I'm doing
anything for nothing,

135
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:35,939
you're wrong!

136
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,372
-Oh, give me a break!

137
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,572
I'm really starting to
hate you stinking frogs!

Anti-amphibian, huh?

140
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,806
Well, take that, you big bigot.

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,139
-Listen.

00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:47,206
I don't have time to play
games, you slimy little squirt.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe it.

144
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,172
After all my training,
this is the best I can do?

145
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,539
I'll just have to make it work.

146
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:59,572
I'm the only one
who can save them.

147

-Worried about the others?

148
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:04,206
That's your big mistake.

149
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,406
When I fight, I fight
for me and me alone.

-Only by attacking and
defeating me can you free her.

153
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,606
And you should hurry.

154
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,572
With each passing second
the sand will harden.

155
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,372
Until it crushes her to death.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sakura.

to a total possession.

159
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,806
And if that happens,
none of us will survive.

[grunting]

166
00:14:03,606 --> 00:14:04,272
-Wow.

167
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:05,839
Boy, are you pathetic.

168
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,039
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Shut up.

169
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,106
-So-- uh-- who the heck
is this freak anyway?

170
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:33,128
-I'll grant you this, sensei.

171
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:34,261
You're very persistent.

172
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:40,494
Why doesn't it move?

173
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:43,628
Why are you so hard to
kill, you old buzzard?

174
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,361
-Have you forgotten
already, Orochimaru?

175
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,528
I told you before.

176
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:55,361
The village hidden in
the leaves is my home.

177
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,361
And I am the central
pillar of that home.

178
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:59,728
-A pillar?

179
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:03,628
-You're nothing but a rotten
old stick that's about to fall.

180
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,094
-As long as there
is one villager who

181
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:10,161
will fight for his friends, lay
down his life for his fellows,

182
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,828
this pillar will stand.

183
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:14,194
The village will survive!

184
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:16,161
-We shall see.

185
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:17,028
-Heh.

186
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,861
Don't underestimate the Hokage!

187
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:24,361
It can't be.

188
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:25,828
Impossible.

189
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:28,894
You must have used up almost
all of your chakra by now.

190
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,428
-That is not how you
measure strength.

191
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,394
True strength comes
from more than chakra.

192
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,994
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Eyes full of loneliness.

193
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:42,661
I've seen that look before.

194
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:45,561
In myself.

195
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:49,828
Now he's turning into
a monster, like me.

196
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:03,461
I remember how I hated
them, because they

197
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:07,161
hated me and I couldn't
understand why.

198
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,828
I wondered why I even existed.

199
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,094
-The fox spirit that
killed Iruka's parents

200
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:15,028
and destroyed our village
has taken over your body.

201
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,994
You are the Nine-Tailed Fox.

202
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:23,128
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's when I found out

203
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,228
I had this demon inside me.

204
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:28,994
It wasn't my fault, but
everyone acted as if it was.

205
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:30,961
That just made it worse.

206
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:35,861
But then--

207
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:39,761
-Hey.

208
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:41,994
How about we take a
ramen break, Naruto?

209
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:42,894
-Yeah!

210
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:44,028
Great idea!

211
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:46,394
With extra barbecue pork!

212
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:47,361
-Pfeh.

213
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,328
You're such a
loser, I don't even

214
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:51,061
know why you bother training.

215
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,228
-I don't need training!

216
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,628
I could clobber you right now!

217
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:58,394
-So, did Sasuke say anything
about how he feels about me?

218
00:16:58,428 --> 00:16:58,961
-No.

219
00:16:58,994 --> 00:16:59,894
Uh-uh.

220
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,194
-Oh.

221
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,628
-But, Sakura, If you want to
know how I feel about you,

222
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:04,661
well-- uh-- wait!

223
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:05,694
Where are you going?

224
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:06,694
What's wrong?

225
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:07,628
Aw.

226
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,094
Time to chow down!

227
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,894
-Naruto, you won't live
long on ramen, beans,

228
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,128
and barbecued pork.

229
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,861
If you want to be
a ninja, you've

230
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,128
got to eat your vegetables.

231
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:17,694
You know.

232
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:18,628
The green stuff.

233
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:19,628
Like this.

234
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:20,628
-Bleh!

235
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,628
Green's about my
least favorite color!

236
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,461
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A
few people came along

237
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,328
who paid attention to me.

238
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,061
That made it better.

239
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,528
It was all right
then, even though I

240
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:33,561
had this monster inside me.

241
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,294
Even though everyone else
acted like I didn't exist.

242
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:40,428
Because it meant that
I wasn't alone anymore.

243
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:44,994
For the first time in a long
time, I was happy again.

244
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:47,694
Really, really happy.

245
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:51,394
They made me remember
how good life could be.

246
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:52,928
They made me glad to be alive.

247
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:01,328
But when I think back to
where I was before I met them,

248
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,694
it's scary.

249
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:06,461
Nothing but pain and darkness.

250
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:11,528
What would I be like if I
had stayed there all alone.

251
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,861
That's how come I
can understand him.

252
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,761
GAARA: It's all a
distant memory now.

253
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,961
Why do I exist, I
used to ask myself.

254
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:25,394
And then I found out.

255
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:30,028
I exist to wipe out every
other existence than my own.

256
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,094
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
don't know how it happened,

257
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:35,394
but this guy's been
there all alone

258
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,228
in that same bottomless
pit of darkness and pain.

259
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,128
He's still there.

260
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,861
That's why he has no one.

261
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:45,761
He fights only for himself.

262
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,528
Maybe he's right.

263
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,161
Maybe it's made him stronger.

264
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:53,328
Maybe it is a weakness to
have friends you care about,

265
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:56,628
to know what happiness is.

266
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:59,994
Can I really win
against a guy like this?

267
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,594
[groaning]

268
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:03,994
-What's the matter?

269
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:06,261
Are you afraid of me?

270
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:10,794
Or are you still thinking of the
best way to save your friends?

271
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:11,328
Fool.

272
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:12,961
Forget them.

273
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,994
Think only of yourself.

274
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,128
Love only yourself.

275
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,894
That is what it means
to be the strongest.

276
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,294
What's wrong?

277
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,528
You were so bold
and cocky before.

278
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,394
Show me your strength.

279
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:31,094
Let me grind it into
dust before your eyes.

280
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,594
Attack, you coward.

281
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:36,061
Fight me or I'll kill
the girl right now.

Not good.

-I think I'll toy
with you a while.

291
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:09,661
I'll watch you
abandon your friends

before you die.

I can't lose.

Anyone who's ever
doubted me, anybody

who thought I was joking when
I said I'd be the next Hokage,

well sit back,
shut up and watch.
