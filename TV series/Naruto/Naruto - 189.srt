no more funny stuff out of you.

You know, he wasn't
the only one who

136
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,009
thought you were acting fishy.

137
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,779
When I went to check
the trap earlier,

138
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,081
I took a shortcut that led
through this huge outcropping

139
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,817
of rocks.

140
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,252
I half expected
to see you there.

141
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:13,821
In fact, I was kind of
surprised you weren't.

142
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,089
Now I understand why.

143
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,125
YURINOJO: The answer was
right in front of us.

144
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,694
Naruto never saw you
when he took his shortcut

145
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,864
because you were steering
clear of areas without water.

146
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:26,300
You wielded those tonfa
not only as weapons,

147
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,868
but as dowsing rods.

148
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,970
And as soon as you
couldn't rely on them,

149
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,373
we were able to lure
you onto drier terrain.

150
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,841
-Hold on.

151
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,811
So that was the reason
you cracked my tonfa?

152
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,813
-Clearly it wasn't
mere coincidence.

153
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,114
-Of course if wasn't.

154
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:45,786
Yurinojo was able to figure out
exactly what you were up to.

155
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,321
-I got a lot of
water weight now,

156
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,089
so this one's going to hurt.

00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:20,154

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,431
I beg of you.

170
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,066
-Consider it done.

171
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,268
Choji, stick around
and make sure he's OK.

172
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,669
YURINOJO: Thanks.

173
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,738
-Hinata may be fast,
but I can catch up.

174
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:47,381
--[gasping] I have
to rest for a while.

175
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,415
-Good idea.

176
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,818
We can wait for the
others right here.

177
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,821
-[gasping]

178
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,093
We will do no such thing.

179
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,928
After I'm done
catching my breath,

180
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,197
you're going to escort me to
safety, and that's an order.

181
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,900
-But Naruto and the others
haven't shown up yet.

182
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,102
-Well, that's their
problem, isn't it?

183
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:11,005
If they do get into trouble
out here, it's their own fault.

184
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:12,840
I wanted to use the
peasants as decoys,

185
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,342
but you three insisted
on the long way.

186
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,279
We'd all be home free by now
if you ninja weren't so soft.

187
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:22,116
-How could you after
what happened to

188
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,817
-What's the problem?

189
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,120
Every ninja risks his
life to perform his duty,

190
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,188
and Kikunojo was aware of that.

191
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,824
Even if he dies, if
I'm alive then there's

192
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,393
still a chance that
the Land of Greens

193
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:36,096
might exist as it once did,
but that hope perishes with me.

194
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,364
-Princess--

195
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:40,234
-Hinata, you can't imagine
the things I've been through.

196
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:43,837
Taken from my parents and held
hostage in a foreign land,

197
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,806
bullied night and day.

198
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,076
But that suffering has
taught me a valuable lesson.

199
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,780
I realized while I was just
a child anyone foolish enough

200
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,716
to put their faith in people
deserves whatever they get.

201
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,952
Someone like your friend
Naruto, for instance,

202
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,954
who let's his emotions
cloud his judgment

203
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:01,822
instead of focusing on
the mission at hand.

204
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,291
A ninja like that who's too
weak to get the job done

205
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,159
is worthless.

206
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,727
-What do you know about Naruto?

207
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,430
You don't get to stand here
and judge him like that!

208
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,699
At least you had a mom and dad.

209
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,000
Naruto's an orphan.

210
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,736
He lives all by
himself, totally alone.

211
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,106
He's worked hard, trying to
win everyone's acceptance

212
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:22,376
and become the next
Hokage, giving it his all.

213
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,912
He's had a difficult
life himself,

214
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,814
but he would never
think of sacrificing

215
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,315
somebody else for
his own well-being.

216
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,683
You know why?

217
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,820
Because he's a good person,
and a good ninja too!

218
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,056
-And he's not the
princess of a feudal land.

219
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,424
-I-I'm sorry.

220
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,027
That was very rude of me.

221
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,363
-Hm!

222
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,933
Hinata, you're pretty fond
of Naruto, aren't you?

223
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,869
-Uh--

224
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,170
-Say no more.

225
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,772
Let's wait for the
others, shall we?

226
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:53,674
-Yes, of course.

227
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,376
-That pack must be really heavy.

228
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,310
Let me give you a hand.

229
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,078
-Oh, uh, thank you.

230
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:05,219
-Ah!

231
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,954
Stupid girl.

232
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:08,956
I'm not dying out
here, and that's final.

233
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:22,836
-Well, don't you look fierce
down there in the dirt.

234
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,171
-Jiga.

235
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,939
You got to help me.

236
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:27,674
I'm your brother.

237
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,211
-Doesn't matter to me, because
with you out of the picture,

238
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,747
instead of me getting
a third, Renga and I

239
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,749
can split the profits in half.

240
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:36,917
-But Jiga--

241
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,352
-It's nothing personal.

242
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:39,086
-Wait!

243
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:39,920
Listen to me.

244
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:46,226
No!

245
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,328
What are you doing?

246
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:51,265
Jiga!

247
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:51,865
Ahhh!

248
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,839
-[laughs]

249
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:18,032
-Hinata!

250
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:21,995
You all right?

251
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,235
-Naruto.

252
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:29,837
Oh!

253
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,772
Where is the princess?

254
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,973
-Beats the heck out of me.

255
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,341
I was about to ask you.

256
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,944
-I said let's wait for the
others, then I turned away,

257
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,212
and then--

258
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,848
-How'd you let an amateur get
close enough to clobber you

259
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:43,650
in the back of the head?

260
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:45,285
-I'm-- I'm sorry.

261
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,988
-She's out here somewhere,
and now she's all by herself.

262
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,356
-Naruto, wait.

263
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,758
Maybe we should head
back to the Hidden Leaf

264
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,794
and ask the Hokage
what to do about this.

265
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,828
-No!

266
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:56,763
We don't have time
to go ask for advice.

267
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,432
There are still two
more of these evil ninja

268
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,900
punks sneaking around.

269
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,169
And if the princess gets
caught by either of them,

270
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,437
they're going to snuff her out.

271
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,939
-But this isn't the mission
we were sent out to perform.

272
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,408
What if we can't
handle the other two?

273
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,178
Maybe we're not good enough.

274
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,080
-Good point.

275
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,414
You're right, Hinata.

276
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,217
This isn't the mission
we came out here to do.

277
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:20,220
But the princess, she's
running for her life,

278
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,825
doing the best she can, and
now she's doing it by herself.

279
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,227
Yeah, she's bossy and mean
and acts like the world

280
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:30,697
revolves around her, I know,
but what kind of person

281
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:32,266
would just writer her off?

282
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,835
-Well, if that's
how you feel, then--

283
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,203
-Here's the plan.

284
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:39,006
Yurinojo took a hit
to the ribs earlier.

285
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,675
You help Choji take care
of him while I go on ahead

286
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,110
and save the princess.

287
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,077
See you later.

288
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,249
-Naruto, be careful.

289
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,830
-Right over there!

290
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,269
MALE SPEAKER: Your reflexes
are pretty good, kid.

291
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:11,838
I see how you could beat Ruiga.

292
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,213
-I'm guessing you're
the second Janin then?

293
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,348
MALE SPEAKER: Well, gosh.

294
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:25,419
To think that a great ninja like
you knows about little old me.

295
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,687
You're lucky.

296
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,655
It's an honor getting
destroyed by Jiga.

297
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,358
Definitely something you can
brag about in the afterlife.

298
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,732
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

299
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,971
-Huh!

00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:45,372
-[gasps]

301
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:48,275
-How stupid do you think I am?

302
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:55,949
-This guy's no push over, and
what kind of ninjutsu is that?

303
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,919
Ahh!

304
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,288
-Didn't meet ninja, huh?

305
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,357
Once Renga and I have
bled this country dry,

306
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:07,361
we'll give your village a visit.

307
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:12,866
-What makes you think I'm
going to let you do that?

308
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:13,867
What the--

309
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:21,808
-Surprise.

310
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:24,836
You didn't know I had
magnetic ninjutsu.

311
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:25,286
-Ahh!

312
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,157
-Had enough?

313
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,758
-Ahh!

314
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,475
Ahhh!

315
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,313
[music playing]

316
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,384
HARUNA (VOICEOVER):
I'm going to live

317
00:19:04,418 --> 00:19:07,679
through this no matter what.

318
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,129
-Ahh!

319
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,130
-This is your tomb.

320
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:19,166
Hope you like it.

321
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,801
-Nah, ain't my style.

322
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:21,802
You can use it instead.

323
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,208
Oh, yeah?

324
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,944
Come on!

-[laughs]

-Man!

327
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,217
What the heck's
going on around here?

328
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:42,823
-What should I do?

329
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:46,226
I've been looking for Choji
but I can't find him anywhere.

330
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,195
Maybe they're not
out in the open.

331
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,363
Maybe they're in hiding.

332
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,064
Yes, of course,
that's probably it.

333

[music playing]

334
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,376
But this-- this is
Naruto's headband.

335
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:09,750
He's in trouble!

336
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:13,320
-While I was growing up, I
drank iron every single day.

337
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:16,256
Thanks to that, I have plenty
of metal floating around

338
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,227
in my body that I can use
as a magnet whenever I want.

339
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,064
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this mountain is full of iron.

340
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,000
As long as I fight you
here, I'm invincible.

341
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,336
-So you're a walking
magazine, huh?

342
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,238
-That's one way to
put it, but I also

343
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:34,107
have the power to magnetize
the things that I touch.

344
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,076
Would you like to
see an example?

345
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,713
All those rocks behind
you should do the trick.

346
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,849
-So how are you going to touch
them from way over there?

347
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:43,316
-Easy.

348
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,818
I already did.

Third one!

352
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,695
-Ahh!

353
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:58,999
HINATA: Naruto!

354
00:20:59,032 --> 00:20:59,699
-Huh!

355
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,334
Who have we here?

356
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:04,304
Don't worry, I'll take
extra good care of her.

-Hinata, stay away!

359
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:14,815
You were right.

360
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,820
This Janin is more
than we can handle.

HINATA (VOICEOVER):
What should I do?

365
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,158
My gentle fist won't work
against his ninja art.

366
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:09,029
It's tough, but I can't beat
him if I fight him head on.

367
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:13,266
But if I don't beat him
soon, Naruto's going to-- no,

368
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,834
I'm not going to
let that happen.

369
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:17,771
I'll find a weak
spot in this jutsu.

370
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:20,707
I'll stop this guy if
it's the last thing I do!

371
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,775
I promise!

372
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:22,943
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, "The Byakugan

373
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:24,244
Sees The Blind Spot!"

374
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:27,714
HINATA (VOICEOVER): I'm going
to give this one attack my all!
