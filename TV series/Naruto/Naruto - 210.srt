-All right, kid.

3
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,660
You'd better come out of there
if you don't want to get hurt.

4
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,328
-I'm no kid!

00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,565
And if you think we're handing
him over to you, you're crazy!

it's a murder jutsu.

Are you going to be all right?

00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,703
-Naruto.

Are you both all right?

-Yes, we're both fine.

53
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,527
-So what do we do now?

54
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,164
I mean, who knows how far away
Sakura and Bushy Brow are.

55
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,666
-I know what I must do.

56
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,502
My mission is to make sure
he is delivered to justice.

57
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:46,306

with a ship split in half.

We've got to run.

61
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,991
Hey, we've got to get moving.

62
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,494
-I won't allow him to escape.

63
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:12,999
The safest thing is to
finish him off right here.

64
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,234
-What are you up to?

65
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,336
What the heck do you
mean, "finish him off?"

66
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,006
-He's certain to be found guilty
and sentenced to death anyway.

67
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,442
We can save them the trouble.

68
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,245
Better that than to let
his friends rescue him.

69
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,647
-Take it easy, they
haven't rescued him yet.

70
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,648
Let's go!

71
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,155
Your mission's the same as mine.

72
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,058
We're supposed to guard him, not
be his judge and executioner.

73
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,504
-I warn you, if you so
much as try anything,

74
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,639
your head will roll!

75
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,176
-What?

76
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,977
Uh!

77
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,411
Come on, move it!

78
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:16,096
[panting] That
will do it for now.

79
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,165
We've lost them.

80
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,634
-Just as well--
you seem exhausted.

81
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,303
-We've gone so deep
into this forest,

82
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,405
I just hope we can
find our way out.

83
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,674
TODOROKI: Don't worry,
we'll take our bearings

84
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,576
from the moon's transit.

85
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,444
We can't go back to the river.

86
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,546
Instead, we'll continue
on through the forest

87
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,314
to the capital.

88
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,986
That is my mission.

89
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,022
-Are you sure about that?

90
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,656
-What do you mean?

91
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,458
-I heard what you said.

92
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,262
You said you were ready to
finish him off on your own.

93
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,664
-That was when I
thought I had no choice.

94
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,466
-If you say so.

95
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,567
Then let's get moving.

96
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,108
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I just
hope Sakura's all right.

97
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,148
-Where is he?

98
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,682
-Naruto will be all right.

99
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,384
He can handle himself.

100
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,685
-I guess.

101
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,556
-If we just keep moving, we
are bound to hook up with him.

102
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,290
-Follow me!

103
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,395
I sense something.

104
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,263
-Where is it?

105
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,234
[gasp]

106
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,102
-Above us!

107
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,284
-Ugh!

108
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:44,751
Well, Lee?

109
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,985
-We follow him.

110
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,720
If the enemy has
captured Naruto,

111
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,122
he will lead us to them.

112
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,369
-Hey.

113
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,504
-What is it?

114
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,973
-There's something I don't get.

115
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,509
We're supposed to be
following the moon, right?

116
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:15,415
Well then, how come the moon's
back there following us?

117
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,649
-Hm, that's peculiar.

118
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,290
-What the heck is going on?

119
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,260
GANTETSU: It's the
Forest of Bewilderment.

120
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,596
Once you get lost in
this place, you'll

121
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,731
never find your way out again.

122
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,566
-Whoa, he spoke!

123
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,368
-Nobody said you could talk.

124
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,569
Be quiet, prisoner!

125
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,705
-Wait, hold on a minute.

126
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,240
Maybe he knows something.

127
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,709
What is the Forest
of Bewilderment?

128
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,178
-All right, prisoner, tell us!

129
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,113
-I know everything about it.

130
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,648
This place is our hideout.

131
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,316
-It's your what?

132
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,020
-So then all this time when we
thought we were escorting you,

133
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,090
you were leading us
into your own hideout!

134
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,993
GANTETSU: It's the perfect
hiding place-- the fog,

135
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,262
winds that blow from
every direction,

136
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,698
magnetic fields so strong
that compasses are useless.

137
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,701
Someone who doesn't know this
place and gets lost in it,

138
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,337
is lost forever.

139
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,639
-Oh, yeah?

140
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,575
Well, I'll find my
way out all right.

141
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,377
-Not alive you won't.

142
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,311
-Oh.

143
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,379
-What?

144
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,514
-It takes someone
like me, who knows

145
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,082
every inch of this forest.

146
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,383
Listen, you'll never find
your way out without me

147
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,384
to guide you.

148
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,053
-What?

149
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:45,488
-Hm, good idea!

150
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,357
If this forest is
your gang's hideout,

151
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,859
you must know it like the
back of your hand, huh?

152
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:50,794
All right, then.

153
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:51,528
It's a deal.

154
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,896
You'll be our guide.

155
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:53,697
-What?

156
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,065
Are you mad?

157
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:58,702
-Our guide-- yes, you'd like
that, wouldn't you villain?

158
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:02,405
I believe you, when you say this
wretched place is your hideout.

159
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,507
That would explain why
you and your friends

160
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,776
are able to maneuver your
way through it so well.

161
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:07,644
-There you go!

162
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,413
-That's why we can't trust him!

163
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:11,781
Don't you understand?

164
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,384
All the time he's pretending
to lead us out of here,

165
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,620
he'll be leading us
deeper into his lair!

166
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,488
-Uh.

167
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,357
What do you think we should do?

168
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:21,992
-We have no choice.

169
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,593
We need to finish him-- now.

170
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:25,895
Or he'll most surely finish us.

171
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,364
-Whoa, uh, slow down.

172
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:28,765
-No one will care.

173
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,634
The world's better
off without him.

174
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,945
-Todoroki, wait!

[gasp]

176
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:46,950
-Who did that?

177
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:49,953
GANTETSU: Everything my comrades
and I stole from others,

178
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,888
I stole from them.

179
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:57,060
They wanted to know where I hid
it, and they didn't ask nicely.

180
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,763
My comrades aren't
coming to rescue me;

181
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:03,066
all they're after is the
money I took from them.

182
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,734
And once they have
all that money,

183
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,771
they'll want me
as dead as you do.

184
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,506
-Oh, is that right?

185
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,074
You expect me to believe that?

186
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,776
-Wait, hang on a second.

187
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,879
You said yourself, you believe
this is their hideout, right?

188
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:18,481
Which means that the others
must know their way around it

189
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:19,616
as well as he does.

190
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,385
Hm, which means that--

191
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,820
-Which means what?

192
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:28,391
-Hmmm, it doesn't really matter
if his friends are coming

193
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,493
to rescue him or to
tear him limb from limb.

194
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,028
The point is they're
coming, and we're

195
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,496
on their stomping grounds.

196
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,998
Which means they know
where they're going,

197
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,666
and we don't have a clue.

198
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,672
I think we have to trust him;
he's the only chance we've got.

199
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,909
Hm, well am I wrong, or what?

-Yes, don't worry.

00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,589
I'm taking a route they'll
never be able to follow.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I wonder if
we really can trust this guy.

But why?

211
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,454
-Its venom has no effect on me.

212

I'm used to it.

-Really?

214
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,360
Because it sure would affect me.

He he.

-Well, looks like
you fell for it.

That was the old Shadow Clone

got to catch me, jerk!

won't solve anything.

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,353
It won't bring your
family back, and you'll

be breaking your vow to deliver
him alive to the capital.

I don't know, it's
hard for me to believe

he could be as bad as that.

If you won't listen
to reason, you

leave me no choice but
to stop you myself.
