NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke?

No.

00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,462
Who is he?

00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:06,028
The same Sharingan as Sasuke's.

00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:08,895
-Hmph, hard to believe
that such a child carries

the Nine-Tailed Fox.

How does this guy

He's here.

you could help me out

16
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:04,458
with my shuriken jutsu
after school today?

-No, I can't.

I'm busy.

Why don't you go ask
father to help you?

You're better at the shuriken
jutsu then father is.

I mean, even I can see that.

00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:21,058
Big brother, why do you always
treat me like such a pest?

-I'm sorry, Sasuke.

-You're always doing this to me.

You jab me in the forehead and
then say, "I'm sorry, Sasuke."

31
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,925
And you never have time.

It's always the same story.

-How come-- how come big brother
never pays any attention to me?

36

-Your brother's always
been a little strange, son.

37
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:34,792
He has a hard time dropping
his guard around other people,

38
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,558
letting them in.

Even I can't read him.

42
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:45,658
And I'm the boy's father.

43
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,892
That kid.

44
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:50,525
-K, here's your lunch, Sasuke.

45
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,125
And as for your
shuriken practice,

46
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:56,625
I can help you work on it
when you get home if you want.

47
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:57,658
-It's not just practice.

48
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,692
It's actual training.

See you later.

50
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,358
-Good morning, Sasuke.

51
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,992
Heading off to
school now, are you?

-Uh huh.

53
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:12,858
-I saw your brother earlier.

54
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,058
He's grown into such a man.

55
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:18,058
He's an excellent
shinobi, isn't he?

56
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,325
Graduating the Academy
at the age of seven,

57
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,225
and first in his class.

58
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,392
And he was a Chunin
at 10, wasn't he?

59
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,825
-Yeah, and he could use
Sharingan by the time

60
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,592
he was eight.

61
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,325
-That's right.

How could I forget?

63
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:34,658
That boy is the pride
of the Uchiha clan.

64
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,125
No doubt about it.

65
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:37,925
What about you, Sasuke?

66
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,392
How old are you now?

67
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,825

same age as my brother when he

68
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:47,792
graduated, and I'm--

00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,292
-What's the matter, child?

70
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:53,658
-Honey, stop talking nonsense
to the boy, will you?

71
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,858
-What do you mean, dear?

72
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:59,492
-Sasuke, both you and Itachi
are of the Uchiha clan,

73
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,258
the brightest gem of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

74

Have faith in yourself.

75

Some day, you'll be an
outstanding shinobi, just

76

and you'll do fine.

SASUKE (VOICEOVER): It's true.

I come from the Uchiha
clan, just like my brother.

82

I won't lose to him.

was someone there.

That's why you did this?

You're telling me that that was

169
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:59,739
Itachi, who is this kid?

170
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,639
-He's my younger brother.

171
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:07,806
-That's strange, because
the way I heard it,

172
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,906
the whole Uchida clan
was wiped out by you.

173
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,973
-Itachi Uchiha, I hope
you're ready to die.

174
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:29,706
I'm going to restore my clan,
and destroy a certain someone.

175
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:30,839
He's still out there.

176
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:36,039
My brother.

177
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:46,506
I promised myself I'd stay
alive until I killed him.

178
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,906
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
This is who he

179
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:50,973
was talking about-- the
one he wanted to kill.

180
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:11,006
-It's just as you said, brother.

181
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,806
I've fostered my hatred
for you all this time.

182
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:21,739
I've lived my life for
one single purpose--

183
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,739
to see you die!

184
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,906
It ends here!

185
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,439
-Sasuke!

186
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,073
-Chidori?

187
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:36,239
-Enough!

188
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:36,973
You're dead!

189
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:46,873
Die!

190
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:16,373
-I-- I don't believe it.

191
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,939
He brushed off Sasuke's
attack like it was nothing.

192
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,973
We've got trouble.

193
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,706
I gotta do something.

194
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:34,639
-Ah, the air is
ripe with chakra.

195
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,606
This must be it-- the
power of the Nine-Tails.

196
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,173
-Enough.

197
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,073
[bone cracking]

198
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:43,539
[screaming]

199
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,506
-Sasuke!

200
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,439
All right, that's it.

201
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:47,939
Ninja art summoning--

202
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:48,906
-Too slow.

203
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,806
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
can't feel my chakra.

204
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,306
Damn it.

205
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,306
Damn it.

206
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,606
What the hell is going on?

207
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,206
-Sorry, kid.

208
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:06,373
My blade, Sharkskin, cuts
through chakra and devours it.

209
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,639
We don't need the hassle
of this kid whipping out

210
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,006
any more jutsu.

211
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,173
Forget the legs.

212
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:18,673
Maybe I ought to start off
with those arms of his.

213
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,973
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Damn
it, why isn't it coming?

214
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,939
-You're wasting your time.

215
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,139
[clang]

216
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:46,173
-What the--?

217
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:57,973
JIRAIYA: You two don't
know me at all, do you?

218
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,473
Should have done your homework.

219
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,873
Jiraiya, the Toad Sage falls
victim to no woman's charm.

220
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:07,606
Rare beauty is dropped for
me like blossoms in a storm.

221
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:12,439
It isn't in my nature to be
duped by the wiles of women.

222
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:15,373
When you reach the
stature I have,

223
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:19,039
the ladies kneel and
worship at your awesomeness.

224
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:30,905
[theme music]

225
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:01,905
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, look out.

226
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,838
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, stay out of it.

227
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:05,538
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Yeah,
but Sasuke needs my help.

228
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:07,005
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto, it is not

229
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:08,305
for you to get involved here.

230
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:10,905
It is your duty to only
bear witness to this battle.

231
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:11,872
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Huh?

232
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:12,938
What do you mean?

233
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:14,405
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
This is his fight.

234
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:16,405
He must bear the
burden of alone.

235
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,205
It is everything he
has struggled for.

236
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:23,072
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, Hate Among the Uchihas--

237
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:25,505
the Last of the Clan.
