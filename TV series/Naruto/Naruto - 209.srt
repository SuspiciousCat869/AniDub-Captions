Great.

15
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,156
Now we gotta deal with a kid.

00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,190

Let's do this!

Let's torch the
mansion and get out.

23
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,250
We don't wanna
leave any evidence.

Now you're it.

00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:35,725
-Yeah.

30
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,026
-You'll never catch me.

31
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,995
I'm too fast!

32
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,997
-Over here!

00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,299

-Over here!

35
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,835
You can't catch us.

36
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,036
SHIZUNE: Lady Tsunade?

37
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:47,903
-Hm?

38
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,605
-There's another request here.

39
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,740
-You're kidding.

40
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:51,707
I thought I dealt
with all of them.

41
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,143
-Sorry.

42
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,744
-Fine.

43
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:55,611
Whatever.

44
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:56,979
-It's the last one.

45
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,881
So if you just concentrate,
it shouldn't take long.

46
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,316
-Let's do it then.

47
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:06,689
[yawn] It's hard to do anything
when it's hot like this.

48
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:07,990
So what do they want?

49
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,126
-Well the police have
requested our assistance.

50
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,261
They need to
transfer a prisoner.

51
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:13,863
-So why do they want our help?

52
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,631
They should be able
to handle that.

53
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:18,601
-Actually, it's a
little more complicated.

54
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,268
Take a look at this.

55
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:23,773
-Interesting.

56
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:24,707
You're right.

57
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,075
This could get tricky.

58
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,778
-The Jonin have all been
assigned to S-level missions,

59
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,012
so they're unavailable.

60
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:32,014
And 9/10 of the Chunin
and Genin are away

61
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:34,316
from the village on
different assignments.

62
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,184
-All right then.

63
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,285
Who does that leave?

64
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,220
-Let's see here.

65
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,088
Uh well--

66
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:42,758
NARUTO: All right!

67
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,694

clone jutsu!

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,937
-Argh!

00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,775
-Let's go, Bushybrow!

00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,745

00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,725
-I am coming for you, Naruto!

74
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,195
Argh!

75
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,162
Plead for a day!

76
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,200
-You asked for it.

77
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:28,137
Here's another serving
of shadow clone jutsu.

78
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,838
Argh!

79
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,609
-That is nothing.

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:52,728
[panting]

81
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,564
-Wasn't bad.

82
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:56,632
-Not bad yourself.

83
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,601
-Naruto!

84
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,102
Lee, where are you?

85
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,604
-Argh!

86
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:04,607
-Argh!

87
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,575

00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,122
-What the heck-- What'd
you guys do to each other?

91
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,593
-Sakura!

92
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,695
SAKURA: Would you stop moving?

93
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,963
-Take it easy.

94
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,732
It wouldn't kill you to
be a little more gentle.

95
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,166
-Oh shut up.

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,302
If you weren't so reckless,
this never would have happened.

97
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:34,770
-Sorry.

98
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:36,672
I do not mean to argue,
but you are mistaken.

99
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,974
Using 100 shadow clones
is an excellent tool

100
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,709
for sharpening one's
taijutsu skills.

101
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,145
Not to mention the fact that
this kind of friendly training

102
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:46,048
is an excellent opportunity for
Naruto to sharpen his skills as

103
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,751
well, thus killing two
birds with one stone.

104
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,719
-I was just gonna say that.

105
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,688
-Call it what you want,
but all you were doing

106
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,923
was beating on each other.

107
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,190
-Of course we were.

108
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,593
Guys always do that
when we get together.

109
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:59,228
-You got that right.

110
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,630
[laughter]

111
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,065
-Fine, whatever.

112
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:05,267
We don't have time to sit
around here arguing about it.

113
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,002
Lady Tsunade wants to see us.

114
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:08,971
-What'd we do wrong this time?

115
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:09,872
-Why us?

116
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,944
-Ninja drop outs?

117
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,612
LADY TSUNADE: That's right.

118
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,948
It's a group of ninja who've
chosen to leave their villages

119
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,749
and give up the
life of a shinobi

120
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,018
to go live in the wild
with others like them.

121
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:24,787
They're a band of
savage thieves who

122
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,189
use their skills to
steal what they want.

123
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:28,691
-You're serious?

124
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,727
They actually use their shinobi
abilities to commit crimes?

125
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,162
-Unforgivable.

126
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:35,197
-One of their members
was captured yesterday

127
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,567
in the Ogi Mountain pass
in the Land of Forests.

128
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,770
This particular guy is wanted
in just about every village

129
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,205
you can think of.

130
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:47,142
He was wandering through the
woods when he was captured.

131
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,277
His name is Gantetsu.

132
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,749
-He doesn't look like
much of a ninja to me.

133
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,250
-We're hoping Gantetsu
has information

134
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,820
that will help us wipe
out the ninja dropouts.

135
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,254
So he's being transferred
to the capital

136
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:02,725
city of the Land of
Forests to be interrogated.

137
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,026
We're assuming
the ninja dropouts

138
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,729
will try to rescue him
somewhere along the way.

139
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,263
The police are taking
every precaution

140
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,633
and have assigned a
full escort to assure

141
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,967
he makes it to the capital.

142
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,869
But since the
opponents are ninja,

143
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,639
they've asked me to assign
several of our own ninja

144
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,807
to ensure the success
of this mission.

145
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,243
So then, that's why
you're all here.

146
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:22,911
-This is awesome!

147
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:25,581
We'll show those guys what the
Hidden Leaf ninja are made of.

148
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:26,715
-That's right.

149
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,584
-Those guys will
not stand a chance.

150
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:29,785
-Good then.

151
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:32,855
Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura
Haruno, Rock Lee.

152
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:34,723
The three of you are
assigned to the mission

153
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,725
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy.

154
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:37,626
-Yes ma'am.

155
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,061
-You can count on us!

156
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,267
-There it is.

157
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,568
That must be it.

158
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,177
-Whoa.

159
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,613
They're gonna
transport him in this?

160
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,048
NARUTO: They have no choice.

161
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,183
The only way to get to the
capital of the Land of Forests

162
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,018
is up this river.

163
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,286
-Hey you guys. Look.

164
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:10,192
-That must be--

165
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,094
SUZUME: The ninja
dropout, Gantetsu.

166
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,062
-Huh?

167
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,997
-Are you the Hidden
Leaf shinobi?

168
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,664
-Yes.

169
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,932
Uh, who are you?

170
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,001
-I'm Suzume, from the
correctional facility.

171
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,170
I'm the one in charge
of this convoy.

172
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,604
-I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

173
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,774
This is Rock Lee, but you can
just call him "Bushybrow."

174
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:27,743
And this is Sakura Haruno.

175
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:29,745
-Hmm.

176
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,780
No disrespect, but you
look kind of young.

177
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,116
Are you sure you're
really ninja?

178
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:35,584
-Of course we are.

179
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,052
-Yup.

180
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:38,854
I know we look young, but we've
all been on dozens of missions.

181
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,256
We are definitely
full-fledged ninja.

182
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,760
-When the time comes, you
will see just how good we are.

183
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,095
-Leave everything to us.

184
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,097
-I expect the security
team I've assembled

185
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,599
to be able to handle
the situation.

186
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,834
But if that's not
enough, I'll be

187
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,303
counting on you and
your ninja skills.

188
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,871
SAKURA: Yes sir.

189
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,139
-These are the men
that I've placed

190
00:10:57,172 --> 00:10:59,007
in charge of the
prisoner's security.

191
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:06,582
-They're all dressed
exactly alike.

192
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:07,750
-You're right.

193
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,051
Those guys sure don't
have much style.

194
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:09,718
-Naruto!

195
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,819
That's rude!

196
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,127
-Ah.

197
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,795
Captain Todoroki.

198
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:20,729
-Yes chief?

199
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:22,131
What can I do for you?

200
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:25,267
-These three ninja here will
be joining us, as backup.

201
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,136
-The name's Naruto Uzumaki.

202
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,270
-Sakura Haruno.

203
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:32,274
-And my name is Rock Lee.

204
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:34,076
-But chief, we discussed this.

205
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:36,745
I told you we already
have enough security.

206
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:37,880
-It's out of my hands.

207
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:41,150
The orders came down from above.

208
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,619
-If you want to help,
stay out of our way.

209
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:45,888
My men and I will
guard Gantetsu.

210
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:50,559
I swear by the
power of my sword.

211
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:51,560
-Oh yeah?

212
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:52,795
Well that sword is nothing.

213
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,263
I could snap it in two
without even trying!

214
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:55,931
I could do it with one hand!

215
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,599
-With just one finger.

216
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,668
-Would you guys
knock it off already?

217
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,170
Please excuse them.

218
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,972
-If you get seasick, try
not to throw up on deck.

219
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,275
-We'll see you on board.

220
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,042
-Yes, sir.

221
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:07,810
Thank you.

222
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,685
-(THINKING) Gantetsu.

223
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:17,853
All right.

224
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,122
Let's lower the
prisoner into the hole.

225
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:22,090
[creaking]

226
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,196
-Right there!

227
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,031
Bring her down!

228
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,033
Incoming!

229
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,568
Incoming!

230
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,036
And there.

231
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,344
[boat whistle]

232
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:55,791
-Wow!

233
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:56,959
This is great!

234
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,531
-This is ridiculous.

235
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,000
They won't even let us see the
guy we're supposed to guard.

236
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:39,603
-They treat us like pests
who are in their way.

237
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:40,938
-Yeah.

238
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,639
Well if those ninja dropout
guys would just attack,

239
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,109
then we could show them
how amazing we really are.

240
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:46,777
-Don't say things like that.

241
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,446
We're better off if the ninja
dropouts never show up at all.

242
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,616
It's our mission to get
Gantetsu safely to the capital.

243
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,651
Not to show how amazing we are.

244
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:56,120
-Yeah, I know.

245
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,521
But still, I'm bored.

246
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,690
How am I gonna keep
myself occupied?

247
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:00,858
-Just deal with it.

248
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,426
It's part of the mission.

249
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,597
-It may be part of the mission,
but I agree with Naruto.

250
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,731
-You're right.

251
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:09,967
I'm getting bored myself.

-Well, dig in.

256
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,472
I still can't get over
them treating us like this.

257
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,807
Who do they think we are?

258
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,842
-Though I have to admit
this stuff is good.

259
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,478
-It's not bad at all.

260
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,614
-Still, it makes me so mad.

261
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:01,185
Seriously, why did they even ask
us to come on this stupid trip anyway?

262
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,423
Ahh.

263
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:07,624
Well I don't care what they say.

264
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,892
I'm gonna go stand guard.

265

gonna get mad at you.

like a criminal.

Stop it.

Are you outta your mind?

-Take a look over there.

00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:36,433
Strange.

300
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:40,170
None of the maps I looked at
showed a fork in the river.

301
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,671
TODOROKI: You.

302
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,973
What are you doing here?

303
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,742
-What I'm doing here
isn't important right now.

304
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,677
The question is,
what were you getting

305
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,579
ready to do to Gantetsu?

306
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:50,881
-What are you inferring?

307
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,516
-It looked like
you were planning

00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,152
to use your sword on him.

That's ridiculous.

It's my mission to see that this
man reaches the capitol safely.

312
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,958
And that's what I'm doing.

-That's good.

314
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,694
Because no matter
what this guy's done,

315
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,630
he still needs to be
interrogated and given

a fair trial before
anything else.

-Brat.

Like you know what he deserves!

319

This guy doesn't need
to be interrogated.

320

He's the one.

died because of him.

He showed no mercy at all!

SAKURA: The
current's too strong.

328
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,626
At this rate,
we'll be pulled in!

00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:09,993
-What the heck?

336
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:10,994
-That's impossible.

337
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,000
-What?

338
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:17,834
No!

339
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:18,869
We've been sliced in half!

340
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,144
-Naruto!

341
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,145
-Over here!

342
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,053
NARUTO: Huh?

343
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:37,787
TODOROKI: You.

344
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,592
The ninja dropouts.

345
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:43,460
They're here.

346
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,394
-It's about time.

347
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:49,833
-Gantetsu.

348
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:59,009
-What have we got here?

349
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,043
Don't move.

350
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:02,579
You better tell me
who you are right now.

351
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:03,847
-I'm Shura Sanjuro.

352
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,448
Head of the ninja dropouts.

353
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:10,487
-You scum.

354
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,122
-Just hand him over.

355
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:13,790
Gantetsu is with us.

356
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:16,459
-Sorry, but that's
not gonna happen.

SAKURA: Lee, are you all right?

361
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:04,926
LEE: Yes.

362
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,027
Although I am not
quite sure how.

363
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,762
What happened back there?

364
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,063
SAKURA: I don't know.

365
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,932
There was a huge crash,
and the next thing I knew,

366
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:12,167
the ship was sliced in half!

367
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,802
LEE: Then the first
thing we need to do

368
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,770
is make sure everyone
on board is all right.

369
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,038
SAKURA: Well--

370
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:18,673
LEE: What is wrong, Sakura?

371
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:20,809
SAKURA: I already checked,
and three of them are missing.

372
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,311
Gantetsu, Captain
Todoroki, and Naruto!

373
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:24,712
LEE: Oh no!

374
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:27,048
NATURO: Next time, the
Bewildering Forest!
