00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,224
[theme music]

2
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:18,663
-Huh?

3
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:31,283
Shizune!

4
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:32,252
-Lady Tsunade!

5
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:33,254
What is it?

6
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,317
What's that?

7
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,521
TSUNADE: A security mission
from the Village Hidden

8
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:50,825
in the Stars.

9
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,759
-Is there something
wrong with that?

10
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,730
-You don't know the Village
Hidden in the Stars,

11
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,967
do you, Shizune?

12
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,441
It's a relatively small place,
but they are proud people

13
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,580
and have caused a lot of
headaches in the past.

14
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:07,486
-So, are you planning
to accept the job?

15
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,825
-I can't simply
disregard it, can I?

16
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,795
-Why not?

17
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:14,334
-That village has
something very special.

18
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:30,736
-Anyway, apparently they
decided to form a three man

19
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,509
squad with Neji as team leader.

20
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,947
-But the Village Hidden in
the Stars is a full on shinobi

21
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,318
village, isn't it?

22
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,655
Why do they need us?

23
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,795
Can't they use their own ninja
to handle security themselves?

24
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:43,763
-Hm.

25
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,033
Well, sometimes
a smaller village

26
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,739
will strengthen relations by
coordinating with its allies

27
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,276
militarily.

28
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,680
And in this case, their
village is smaller than most.

29
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,954
They probably don't have
enough ninja to protect it.

30
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:56,357
-Oh.

31
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:58,428
But why's a place that
tiny being attacked?

32
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,938
-You don't know?

33
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:05,999
It all started 200
years ago,

34
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:15,165
when a shooter star hit the village.

35
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:19,640
-You mean like a star in the
sky, not like a throwing star,

36
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:20,408
right?

37
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:21,077
-Yep.

38
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,579
And according to
legend, the star

39
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:25,085
contains a mysterious power
that can affect chakra.

40
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:30,329
-What a ridiculous story!

41
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,668
-First off, no way has a
star ever just dropped out

42
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,539
of the sky and his the Earth.

43
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:35,641
-It happened.

44
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,444
Why do you think the
village has been targeted

45
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:39,917
by foreign shinobi
several times already?

46
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,925
-Wha-- This isn't
the first time?

47
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,996
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Mysterious power, huh?

48
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:51,441
Sounds like something Orochimaru
would wanna get his hands on.

49
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:52,376
-OK.

50
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,880
Looks like I'll
be going with him.

51
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,480
-What?

52
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:55,584
You can't.

53
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,354
The three man squad's
already been chosen.

54
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:59,358
-Yeah, but I got an
ace up my sleeve.

55
00:05:59,358 --> 00:05:59,799
Hm.

56
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,753
-All right, I'd better take the
lead position from here on out.

57
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,757
We may run into
danger on the way.

58
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,628
-OK, sounds good.

59
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:17,596
-Heya fellas!

60
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,531
I'm gonna keep going.

61
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,637
See you there!

62
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,505
-Naruto!

63
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,407
Hold on!

64
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,944
No way.

65
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:26,783
-Um, what is Naruto doing
on this mission anyway?

66
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:27,985
-No idea.

67
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,656
-Lady Tsunade.

68
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,959
We just received
word that Naruto

69
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,495
has joined up with Neji's team.

70
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:32,963
-(MUMBLING) Mm.

71
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:33,998
Yes.

72
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,468
I added him to the
mission last minute.

73
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:36,570
-Wh-- Why?

74
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,942
-Those four did well at
the Katabami Gold Mine.

75
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,882
Besides, while he's
gone, I can relax.

76
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,821
-You would change the lineup of
an established squad on a whim?

77
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,124
[choking]

78
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:47,126
-Lady Tsunade!

79
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,604
Is that a rare roasted
chestnut bean jelly

80
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,544
with gold leaf candy?

81
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:56,914
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER):
Wait a second.

82
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,918
Did Naruto bribe her with that?

83
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,619
-(MUFFLED) Tea!

84
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,188
I need tea!

85
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:00,870
Now!

86
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,253
-Izura!

87
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:03,222
-You OK?

88
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:05,827
-I'm fine.

89
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,998
-I said not to push yourself.

90
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,969
-I know you did,
but I just don't

91
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:14,178
want to fall behind
the rest of you guys.

92
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:16,115
-You are supposed
to be training.

93
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:18,888
-Mizura was in pain,
so we stopped, sir.

94
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,525
-Take him to get
medical attention.

95
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,193
-Yes, sir.

96
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:22,663
-I'll go too.

97
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:26,538
-Hokuto can accompany
him there alone.

98
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,776
Sumaru, do not
forget your training.

99
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:36,660
-All right.

100
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,931
I'm the first one here.

101
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,004
Once I cross this canyon,
I'm in the Land of Bears.

102
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,908
The Village Hidden in
the Stars is close.

103
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:50,823
Huh?

104
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,715
Eat that!

105
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,753
-Ninja Art, Kujaku.

106
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,623
Protection.

107
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:25,764
-He blocked my
kunai with chakra.

108
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,734
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

109
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:32,126
-Destroy!

110
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,586
-Aw man.

111
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:43,969
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): The
chakra's incredible.

112
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:00,772
-Stop.

113
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:01,807
But this jerk's an enemy.

114
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,611
He attacked me out of the blue!

115
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,323
-Oh.

116
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:10,258
You're a Leaf ninja.

117
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,834
-Wait.

118
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,039
You're from the
Hidden Star village?

119
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,308
-I'm Sumaru.

120
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,313
I came to pick up
you and your friends.

121
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,952
-So what's with the arrows?

122
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:23,954
-Look there, Naruto.

123
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:29,381
-Huh?

124
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:51,213
-The border canyon
of the Land of Bears

125
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:53,383
is eternally filled
with poison gas.

126
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:57,191
The fog acts as a barrier
against foreign invaders.

127
00:10:57,225 --> 00:10:58,361
-Whoa.

128
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,432
So this was the danger
you warned us about, huh?

129
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,469
-You should be grateful, Naruto.

130
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,443
It looks like Sumaru
truly saved your life.

131
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,347
It is the beginning of
a beautiful friendship

132
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,883
between Leaf and Star.

133
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,954
[laughter]

134
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:11,723
-Whatever.

135
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,225
I didn't need his help.

136
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,430
-I didn't have to
help you, you know?

137
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:18,203
I could have just stood there
watching while you perished.

138
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,169
-I'm Akahoshi, and I
serve as deputy Hoshikage

139
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:50,872
of this village.

140
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:51,507
-Deputy?

141
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,511
But then--

142
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:56,919
-The Third Hoshikage passed
on quite suddenly a year ago,

143
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,258
so at present the village finds
itself without a true leader.

144
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,499
-But I thought only leaders
of the five great villages

145
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:04,534
could be called Kage.

146
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,105
-Yeah.

147
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,377
SUMARU: That makes
no difference.

148
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,786
The people of this village
are inferior to no one.

149
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,890
We may be small, but
someday this village

150
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,329
will rival those of
the five great lands.

151
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,834
And when that day comes,
I will be Hoshikage.

152
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,308
-Be quiet.

153
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,417
Return to your training at once.

154
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:33,229
-Hey, wait up!

155
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:34,800
I want to ask you something!

156
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,802
-Naruto!

157
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,173
TENTEN: Where are you going?

158
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:41,113
There he goes again.

159
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,449
-I'm sorry about our friend.

160
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,551
Please continue, sir.

161
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:47,993
-Where was I?

162
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,163
Yes.

163
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:50,967
As you correctly pointed
out, the shinobi of our land

164
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,506
are not qualified
to even have a Kage.

165
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,247
However, we possess a star
that the Kages of the five

166
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,184
great hidden villages covet.

167
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,423
Someday we'll harness
the power of the star,

168
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:05,164
and our village will at last
be able to seat a sixth Kage.

169
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:07,836
-So your enemies have been
trying to get that star.

170
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,272
-That's right.

171
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:12,045
Our scouting team managed to
get some useful intelligence.

172
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:15,987
-Huh?

173
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,924
Where the heck did
that guy run off to?

174
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,171
Huh?

175
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,297
Hey!

176
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,232
I finally caught up.

177
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,902
What was your name, again?

178
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,205
Omaru?

179
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,875
-No, not Omaru.

180
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:42,877
Sumaru.

181
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,512
-Oh.

182
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:45,449
Oops, sorry about that.

183
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:48,055
But hey, Sumaru is a
pretty interesting name.

184
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,193
-Well, it's derived
from the star cluster

185
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,130
Subaru, or the Pleiades.

186
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,168
In fact, everyone in
our village has a name

187
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,306
that's associated
with a certain star.

188
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,145
After all, this is
where a star fell.

189
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,951
-No kidding.

190
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,189
-What do you want
from me, anyway?

191
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:05,158
-Who, me?

192
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,162
Ah, nothing in particular.

193
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:10,002
I just realized I never
thanked you before, you know?

194
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:12,139
-Don't try to act nice with me.

195
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,177
Foreigners are all the same.

196
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,482
They're all trying
to get to our star.

197
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,952
They think if they
get its power,

198
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,457
they can rise above the
other hidden villages.

199
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,428
-So does that mean
that chakra of yours

200
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,437
is fueled by the power
of the star, too?

201
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,675
I mean, if someone
else had the star,

202
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,612
wouldn't they have the
same chakra as you do?

203
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,115
-No!

204
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,487
The more power you draw from
it, the more hard work and skill

205
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:35,556
you need to control it.

206
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,458
-Yeah, but--

207
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,527
-And that's what
I'm going to do.

208
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,130
Nothing but hard work.

209
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,502
I will become the Hoshikage.

210
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:42,371
-Great.

211
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,108
I can't wait to work with ya.

212
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,243
-Huh?

213
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:49,353
-'Cause I'm gonna become
Hokage of my village, too.

214
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,557
-You know, you're kind of weird.

215
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,158
-You think?

216
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:54,724
-Intruder!

217
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:56,294
Guard the star!

218
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,610
-Oh, man, you're right.

219
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,683
The tree trunks all fell outward
from the center of the crater.

220
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,654
-When a star impacts
like this, it's

221
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,293
exactly the pattern
you would expect.

222
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,732
Over there is our training area,
where the star is enshrined.

223
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,041
-Well, let's go.

224
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:19,243
I'm dying to see it.

225
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:20,580
-Never.

226
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,753
No one from a foreign land
is allowed beyond this point.

227
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,757
-The star's the
point of the mission.

228
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:28,162
How are supposed to protect
the thing if we can't even

229
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,131
get close to it?

230
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:30,301
-You're foreigners.

231
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:33,106
We can't just leave you
with something so sacred.

232
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:35,344
-Man, you really are
paranoid, you know that, pal?

233
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:36,614
I mean, come on.

234
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,386
You hired us for security,
and you still don't trust us?

235
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,490
-Well, I am who I am.

236

00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,403
-Huh?

238
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:48,639
-Who is that?

239
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,476
The star!

240
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,713
-I'll go chase him down.

241
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:55,187
You check on your friends
in the training building.

242
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,360
We don't have time to hesitate.

243
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,261
-Right.

244
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:00,364
We'll have to split up.

245
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,568
Hokuto.

246
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,112
-Sumaru.

247
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:23,714
I'm sorry.

248
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,685
We couldn't protect it.

249
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:38,879
-Did you really
think you could just

250
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,251
steal something from this
village in broad daylight,

251
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:42,620
and get away with it?

You got no chance
of getting away.

00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:11,449
That same chakra?

00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:11,931
-Beast.

259
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:21,436
-Oh, no!

260
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,438
Look out!

261
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:26,815
We gotta get this guy!

262

Fire the everywhere,

-It's futile.

-Gotcha.

265
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,793
You're the real target, and
I just found your weakness.

All right, guys,
his physical body

can't move while he's
controlling a jutsu.

Let's get him, with
a clone body slam!

Yah!

You can fly, too?

-What's going on?

That jerk used the exact
same ninja art as you.

Want to tell me what's
really going on?

-That ninja art.

289

Only a star-trained
ninja could know it.

290

-You mean that guy was from the
Village Hidden in the Stars?

-I can't be sure.

-Listen to me.

I'm the one who
let him get away,

some kind of secret.

We need to investigate
the leader.
