CHOJI (VOICEOVER): Shikamaru.

He's always believed in me.

00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,381
SHIKAMARU: More than me,
or Neji, or any of us

5
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:59,114
here, Choji's got strength.

Goodbye old friend.

00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:10,647
I'll always believe in you.

00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,514
-Shikamaru.

22
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,581
I did it.

00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:23,514
What?

24
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,581
-I don't believe I have
to go to the second state

25
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,781
for an opponent as
weak as this one.

-I'm afraid it's
all over for you.

30
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,381
In second state, I'm invincible.

31
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,714
I can dish out 10 times as
much power as I could before.

CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
It hurts to move.

I didn't know the side
effects of the curry pill

34
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,347
would be so intense.

35

-You better listen
to me, because I'm

36
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:33,647
about to teach you
an important lesson.

This is what happens
to weaklings!

You're pathetic.

39
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,014
You'd be better off playing
ninja with your friends.

-What are you doing?

53

Get out of here.

-We caught them, so we win.

00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:41,281
-I'm so sick of this.

61
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:45,447
Whatever team Choji's on
loses every single time.

62
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,014
-Sorry.

63
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:57,614
-Ha.

64
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,014
-Now that I'm in
my second state,

65
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:10,047
I'm gonna need a lot
more chakra, which

66
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:11,847
means I'm going to
have to take whatever

67
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:14,547
you have left inside you.

68
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:16,247
All right, kiddo.

69
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,714
Let's get this over with.

70
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:26,381
You don't have very
much left, do you?

71
00:06:26,414 --> 00:06:27,847
Empty already?

72
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,647

Huh?

76
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:53,881
Oh, of course.

77
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,514
Fatso only left one chip.

78
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,547
Well, I guess I'll
take what I can get.

79
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,647
How does it feel to be a pawn?

80
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,047
To be sacrificed by
your so-called friends?

81
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,447
Left here for dead?

82
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:15,881
A pitiful fatso,
the odd man out.

83
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:19,347
BOY: You can't play
ninja with us anymore.

84
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,347
-But why can't I?

85
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:23,914
-Because whenever you
play with us, we lose.

86
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:25,181
-Yeah, you're way too slow.

87
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,214
-You know, guys, without him,
the teams aren't gonna be even.

88
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:33,581
It'd be lame.

89
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:37,981
Like if you played a game of
Shogi with one piece missing.

90
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:40,247
-But if you have one piece
that's totally useless,

91
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,814
it's the same thing.

92
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:42,881
-Yeah, what he said.

93
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:48,814
-It's our team and we don't
mind having one less person,

94
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,214
so let's just play.

95
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:53,247
-Well, if it's OK with
you, I guess it's fine.

96
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,814
-OK then, it's settled.

97
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,781
-We're so gonna win this time.

98
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:57,481
-Yeah!

99
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:58,581
Where should we hide?

100
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,514
BOY: What do you think?

101
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,847
-At least chunky's not playing.

102
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,514
Here's the plan.

103
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:03,647
You guys go left.

104
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,481
-All right, yeah, I'll
go hide in the alley.

105
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:40,347
-And they said the whole
Akimichi clan is fat and slow.

106
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,547
Then everybody laughed at me.

107
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:43,747
-Did they really?

108
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,147
Let me tell you something, son.

109
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,981
None of those boys have
as kind a heart as you do.

110
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,481
-Hm?

111
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,047
-And someday, you'll have
a group of real friends

112
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:03,081
who see that quality inside
you and respect you for it.

113
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:05,581
You'll find friends
who believe in you,

114
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:08,047
who trust you with their lives.

115
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,547
Cherish those friends, Choji.

116
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,914
CHOJI: You think someone
like me could really

117
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:17,214
have friends like that?

118
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:19,047
-Rest in peace, scum.

119
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,381
But you're not the only
loser I'm gonna destroy.

120
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,681
After I'm finished
here with you,

121
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:27,314
I'm gonna hunt down your
heartless friends that

122
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:30,381
sacrificed you for their
own good and crush them too.

123
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,381
-It's for Choji.

124
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,881
He promised us he'd catch up.

125
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,681
You better catch
up with us, Choji.

126
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,081
You hear me?

127
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,681
-Yeah!

128
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:51,914
-Trust me.

129
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:54,347
He will bear that guy.

130
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:56,414
And after he does,
he'll come and find us.

131
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,381
-No doubt about it.

132
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:02,014
If anyone can defeat
him, it's Choji.

133
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:08,581
-Well, as long as we've stopped.

134
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:09,314
-Good idea.

135
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,181
-All right, everyone.

136
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,181
Let's get Sasuke back
before Choji catches up.

137
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:19,347
-Huh?

138
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,114
-Hey, wait for me!

139
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:22,614
-All right!

140
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,981
Here we come!

141
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,169
-Jirobo's late.

142
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,235
He should have
gotten here by now.

143
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,035
-Well, you know how enormous
his appetite can be.

144
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:49,235
He's probably squeezing out
every last bit of chakra.

145
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,835
-Man, I wish I could be
in his shoes right now.

146
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,002
-Oh, sorry.

147
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,569
Looks like I finished the bag.

148
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:04,802
Well, punk.

149
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,902
It's getting late, and I've
got some people to meet.

150
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,269
Looks like it's about
time to say your goodbyes.

151
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:17,535
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): I've still
got the chili pepper pill left,

152
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:23,269
but if I-- if I
swallow it, I'll die.

153
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:30,569
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
No matter what, don't you

154
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:31,535
die on me, Choji.

155
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:39,802
We've always stuck together,
ever since the day we met.

156
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:49,735
Hm?

157
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:50,235
Hm.

158
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,169
Huh?

159
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,569
Oh, it's you.

160
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:04,069
-Hm?

161
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:05,969
-Oh, yeah.

162
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,369
You were with those kids.

163
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:09,402
Weren't you playing
ninja with them?

164
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:10,202
-Heh.

165
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:11,835
They were a drag, so I quit.

166
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,169
-Really?

167
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:15,635
-By the way, you're kind of
sitting on my special spot.

168
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,169
-Your special spot?

169
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:18,035
-Yeah.

170
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,202
On a nice day like
this, I always

171
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:20,869
come out here and
lie on my back,

172
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:24,435
and just stare at
the clouds, you know?

173
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,569
-You came to look at clouds?

174
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:28,935
-That's right.

175
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:30,669
So, can I sit?

176
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:31,435
-Oh, sure.

177
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,035
-This is such an awesome spot.

178
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:39,202
The sky looks amazing.

179
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:42,702
-You're right.

180
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,635
-Hey.

181
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,502
-What?

182
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:53,102
-The clouds are pretty
cool from down here.

183
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:55,402
Wanna lie back
and watch with me?

184
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:56,369
-Uh.

185
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,702
Yeah, thanks!

186
00:12:58,735 --> 00:12:59,769
Hey.

187
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:02,035
You know, I brought
some snacks with me.

188
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,135
You want to share them?

189
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,269
SHIKAMARU: That'd be great.

190
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,335
Hey, thanks.

191
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:14,369
Eating chips and
watching clouds.

192
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,302
Man, this is the best.

193
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:16,802
-Yep.

194
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,869
-By the way, my
name's Shikamaru.

195
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,835
I'm from the Nara clan.

196
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:25,969
What about you?

197
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,269
What's your name?

198
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,802
-It's Choji.

199
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:31,969
My name is Choji, and I'm
from the Akimichi clan.

200
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:33,669
-Choji, huh?

201
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:36,702
I got a feeling that you
and me'll be friends.

202
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:37,702
-Yeah, me too.

203
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,569
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
We've always stuck together,

204
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,735
and there's no way
that's gonna end now.

205
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:54,235
Choji.

206
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:09,369
CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
Shikamaru-- I'm sorry.

207
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:11,502
I'm not gonna catch up.

208
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:12,569
-It's over.

209
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,635
Say your prayers.

210
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:15,735
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): No.

211
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:18,102
I have to stop him.

212
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:21,202
Even if it means I
die, I've got to win.

213
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,235
-There's nothing you
can do to stop me!

214
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,502
Crushing Palm!

215
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:33,335
Huh?

216
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:54,835
Wh-- What is that?

217
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,869
Doesn't matter.

218
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:57,569
Slamming Boulder!

219
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:04,235
-Don't even try.

220
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,202
Because now, I'm a hundred
times stronger than before.

221
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,369
People hold grudges
when you take

222
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:17,902
something important from them.

223
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,269
Like, for instance, their food!

224
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:21,802
That strike I gave
you was for eating

225
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:24,469
the last bite of
my favorite snack!

226
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:25,935
JIROBO (VOICEOVER): Impossible!

227
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,402
This punk has so much chakra,
his body's actually changed.

228
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:34,702
-And this next attack
is for calling me lames,

229
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,602
like pawn, and fatso, and loser.

230
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,035
I can handle being picked
on, but what you've done

231
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,302
is unforgivable!

232
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:47,369
-When you've got an idiot for a
leader, the whole team suffers.

233
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,969
Know what I mean?

234
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:51,369
Tell you what.

235
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:54,235
You don't want to keep working
under this glum-faced little

236
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:54,935
shadow lover.

237
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:03,135
I'll just kill you now, and
put you out of your misery.

238
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,569
-He was my best friend,
and you insulted him!

239
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,569
How dare you.

240
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:11,402
You can steal my very last
bite of my very best food,

241
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:15,202
you can mock me all you want,
but when you insult my best

242
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:19,202
friend, I will obliterate you!

243
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:27,135
All of my chakra
to my left hand.

244
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:32,002
This last attack is
worth my whole life!

245
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:32,502
-Wait!

246
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:33,169
No!

247
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,469
Please don't do it!

A guy like me-- I beat him.

CHOZA (VOICEOVER): Let me
tell you something, son.

254
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:40,435
None of those boys have
as kind a heart as you do.

255
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:43,269
And someday you'll have
a group of real friends

256
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:48,069
who see that quality inside
you and respect you for it.

257
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:50,769
You'll find friends
who believe in you,

258
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:53,202
who trust you with their lives.

259
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,835
Cherish those friends, Choji.

Even for a bag of
potato chips, I

refuse to let anyone
have the last bite!

-Choji and I have been on the
same team for a long time.

272
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,835
We work well together, so
asking him's a no brainer.

00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,669
-Dad, you were right.

00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,102
I made some really
great friends.
