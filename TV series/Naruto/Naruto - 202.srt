00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,273
THEME SONG:
[singing in japanese]

2
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,547
-All right.

3
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,248
Thanks for waiting, everybody.

4
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,184
To celebrate this
show's blockbuster run,

5
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,354
we bring you the top five ninja
battles to date, full of blood,

6
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,388
sweat, and tears.

7
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,156
And plenty of extras
packed in, to boot!

8
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,226
Boy, it kind of gives you
butterflies inside, doesn't it?

9
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,362
-It's been four years now
since the show hit the air,

10
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,230
and our fifth is just
around the corner.

11
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,765
But without all
our terrific fans

12
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,401
we never would have
made it this far.

13
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,536
-So today we've decided
to switch things up a bit,

14
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,239
take a moment to look back at
the five most popular showdowns

15
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:23,377
in Naruto history, as voted
on by the people of the Hidden

16
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,044
Leaf Village.

17
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,312
-And who knows?

18
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,114
Maybe you'll see your
own personal favorite

19
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,515
in the shuffle.

20
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,317
With all the special guests
we have lined up for you,

21
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,685
you won't want to miss a beat.

22
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,987
-Now let's get
this party started.

23
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,389
Right off the bat
we'll be taking a look

24
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,558
at the fights that clocked
in at fourth and fifth place.

25
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,300
Yeah.

26
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,168
Here we go.

27
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,503
I'm the first one on the board.

28
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,239
Just what you'd expect
from the hero of the story.

29
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,375
I've got the audience
in the palm of my hand.

30
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,009
SAKURA: Ooh!

31
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,377
You're so right.

32
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,113
The poetry of Sasuke in
motion-- it's indescribable.

33
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,417
His destructive power
is mind-blowing.

34
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,084
Ah!

35
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,552
NARUTO: OK.

36
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,989
Uh, Sakura-- we're not really
on the same page here, you know?

37
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,490
SAKURA: Ah, zip it
for once, will ya?

38
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,224
NARUTO: Right.

39
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,396
-Multi-shadow clone jutsu!

40
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,008
SAKURA: He switches
between offense and defense

41
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,411
in a heartbeat.

42
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,382
And now for the kick!

43
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,183
That's it.

44
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,318
Hit him where it hurts!

45
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,086
And

46
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,353
NARUTO: Ahem.

47
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,755
Uh, Sakura-- how about
a little cheerleading

48
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,391
for the hero of the story, here?

49
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,059
SAKURA: Shut up, Naruto!

50
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,599
-Uzumaki Barrage!

51
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,472
-Fire Style-- Fireball jutsu!

52
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,482
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): How did
he-- what jutsu is that?

53
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,522
Blast.

54
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:19,259
-Chidori-- One Thousand Birds!

55
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:19,741
-Please.

56
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:20,494
Stop this.

57
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,365
Stop it!

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,509
-What did you have
to go and clock me

59
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,710
in the eye for, Sakura?

60
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,011
-I couldn't help myself.

61
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,113
I got too excited.

62
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,182
Now let's get back
on track and find out

63
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,451
who's in the fourth place spot.

64
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,387
-There is nothing you
can do to stop me!

65
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,321
Crushing Palm!

66
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,493
NARUTO: Man.

67
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,095
No matter how many
times I watch this one

68
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,696
it always beings me to tears.

69
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,331
SAKURA: I know what you mean.

70
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,634
I had to pull out a hanky
when I was watching it on TV.

71
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,238
When it aired there wasn't a
dry eye in the Land of Fire.

72
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,506
-Yeah.

73
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,976
I really thought Choji had
bought it in this episode, too.

74
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,478
-That's for sure.

75
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,982
The producers caught me hook,
line and sinker with that one.

76
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,585
-What is that?

77
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,986
Doesn't matter.

78
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,321
Sonic Boulder!

79
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,460
-Don't even try.

80
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,097
Because now I'm a hundred
times stronger than before.

81
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,273
People hold grudges
when you take something

82
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,643
important from them-- like,
for instance, their food.

83
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,378
That strike I gave
you was for eating

84
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,515
the last bite of
my favorite snack!

85
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,150
-Impossible.

86
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,986
This punk has so much chakra
his body's actually changed.

87
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:57,624
-And this next attack--
is for calling me

88
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:02,162
names like pawn,
fatso, and loser.

89
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,598
I can handle being picked
on, but what you've done

90
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,999
is unforgivable.

91
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,201
He was my best friend.

92
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,604
And you insulted him.

93
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,172
How dare you?

94
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,507
You can steal my very last
bite of my very best food,

95
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,343
you can mock me all you want.

96
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:22,415
But when you insult my best
friend-- I will obliterate you!

97
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:30,123
All of money chakra
to my left hand.

98
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:35,295
This last attack is
worth my whole life!

99
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:35,752
-Wait!

100
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,529
No!

101
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,264
Please don't do it!

102
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,643
NARUTO: Seeing it again like
this it really hits you.

103
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,012
This was fatty versus fatty.

104
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,980
I mean, where was the eye candy?

105
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,415
It was all just
huffing and sweating.

106
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,251
I wouldn't watch this on a
summer day, I tell you that.

107
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,454
CHOJI: Well excuse
me for fighting.

108
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,689
NARUTO: What-- Choji?

109
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,158
SAKURA: How long
have you been there?

110
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,327
CHOJI: I heard my big
battle made the top five.

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,496
NARUTO: Look, Choji,
let me explain.

112
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,630
SAKURA: Stay calm.

113
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,532
CHOJI: Human Boulder!

114
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,434
Boom, boom, boom!

115
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,702
NARUTO: Whoa!

116
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,636
CHOJI: I rule.

117
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,709
-I did it.

118
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,644
CHOJI (VOICEOVER):
A guy like me.

119
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,512
I beat him.

120
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,086
-Sorry for the technical
difficulties, folks.

121
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,255
But hey, what do you
say we just press on?

122
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,390
-But before we move
on to the top three,

123
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,993
why don't we revisit a few
of the breathtaking battles

124
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,162
that didn't quite
make the final cut.

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,732
Is the epic showdown you've
always liked one of them?

126
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,034
Let's have a look and see.

127
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,275
-Tori.

128
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,376
Water style.

129
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,044
Water Dragon jutsu.

130
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,312
NARUTO: Kakashi-sensei
will always

131
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,081
have the upper hand
with his Sharingan.

132
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,149
SAKURA: Just what you'd
expect of a jounin.

133
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:19,599
-Late again.

134
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,533
NARUTO: Huh?

135
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,135
This is an epic battle?

136
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,237
SAKURA: Well, sometimes you
gotta mix things up a little,

137
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,205
right?

138
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,040
-We've tied each
other at 48 wins.

139
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:31,511
Today's face-off will put
one of us in the lead.

140
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,982
-You're not going to take
no for an answer, are you?

141
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,283
All right, then.

142
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,487
It's my turn to name
the challenge, right?

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,654
-So what'll it be?

144
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,689
A round of taijutsu?

145
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,557
A hundred-meter dash?

146
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,558
Holding our breath?

147
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,595
Or an eating contest, maybe?

148
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,529
-Oh, boy.

149
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,563
OK.

150
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,564
I got one.

151
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,365
-Yeah?

152
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,567
Lat it on me.

153
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,735
-Rock, paper, scissors.

154
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:56,503
-All right.

155
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,370
You're on.

156
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,571
And I aim to win.

157
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:02,075
If I lose I'll take 500 laps
around the Leaf Village.

158
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,510
On my hands, too.

159
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,512
-There you go again.

160
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,980
-That's a promise!

161
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,281
-Great.

162
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,516
Another one of his oddball
self-imposed rules.

163
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,423
NARUTO: OK.

164
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,524
All together, now.

165
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,525
-Rock!

166
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,492
Paper!

167
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,461
Scissors!

168
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,396
SAKURA: We'll be back
with the top three

169
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,998
after this short break.

170
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,853
Stay tuned.

171
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,561
And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

172
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,397
The mega three.

173
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,865
-Starting with the third.

174
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:44,537
Let's see which battle busted
through to the upper ranks!

175
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,505
SAKURA: Look!

176
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:48,608
It's the Kiba-Akamaru
dynamic duo.

177
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,609
NARUTO: Big deal.

178
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,812
Those two are all
bark and no bite.

179
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,213
-What are you saying?

180
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,883
Are you telling me
you want to try that?

181
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,451
We can't, Akamaru.

182
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,353
There's nobody
here to back us up.

183
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,455
It'd be way too dangerous.

184
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,557
You understand, don't you?

185
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,460
If we miss we'll have
died for nothing.

186
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:13,889
Akamaru.

187
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:23,743
KIBA (VOICEOVER): I must
be a lousy master for you

188
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,278
to bite me like that.

189
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,349
OK, Akamaru.

190
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:30,950
It's just like you said.

191
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:33,319
We're all out of options.

192
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:35,455
-Wolf Fang Over Fang it is.

193
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:44,731
[laughter]

194
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:49,602
Now, Akamaru!

195
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,807
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Show 'em
what all that training was for!

196
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,477
-Dynamic Marking!

197
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,747
-What kind of cheap
trick is that?

198
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:01,614
-OK.

199
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,549
We're good to go.

200
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,484
Inuzuka style.

201
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,486
Man Beast Transformation Combo!

202
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,698
Two-Headed Wolf!

203
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,369
Take this!

204
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,641
-[inaudible].

205
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:29,342
-Sakon, you idiot.

206
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:30,810
On your right!

207
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:31,477
-Oh, no.

208
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:32,645
I--

209
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:35,982
-Wolf Fang Over Fang!

210
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:37,884
SAKURA: A bite on the
hand helped his master

211
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,318
with a tough decision.

212
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:41,220
Akamaru's popularity
went through the roof

213
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,655
after this fight.

214
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:45,324
Oh, what a man!

215
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:46,826
NARUTO: Man my butt.

216
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:51,364
He's just a mangy mutt of a
dog with beady little eyes.

217
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:54,567
-You got a problem with
my dog, you nitwit?

218
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,468
-Ahh!

219
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:56,469
Kiba?

220
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:57,970
How long you been
standing there?

221
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,472
I didn't even see you.

222
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:00,573
-Shut it.

223
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,275
Is this how you treat
a guest on your show?

224
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,377
We're in the top rank,
for crying out loud.

225
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,212
And speaking of
insulting, what's

226
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:09,449
the deal with us coming
in at number three?

227
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,617
-Our third place
finalist, folks.

228
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,352
A man and his dog.

229
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:15,488
Why don't you face the
camera and offer a few words

230
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:18,291
to everyone watching
back at home.

231
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:21,894
-Oh, uh-- thanks a million
for tuning in every week.

232
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:24,697
We could never have done it
without all your support.

233
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,532
I know we came in
third and all, but you

234
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,435
can expect some real
butt-kicking in the future.

235
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:32,405
So don't you count us out yet.

236
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:34,474
-That's pretty big
talk, there, dog-boy.

237
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:37,944
I don't recall any other
moments of greatness lately.

238
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:40,546
-I said in the future, didn't I?

239
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,314
That's it.

240
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:42,281
I've had enough of you.

241
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:42,882
Sic him, Akamaru.

242
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,324
-And now we move on to
the big number two spot.

243
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,369
NEJI (VOICEOVER): He's like
a totally different opponent.

244
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:06,739
His chakra activity
is staggering.

245
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,407
And those markings--

246
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:20,853
KIDOMARU (VOICEOVER): So, this
guy is able to see in the dark.

247
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,256
And to dodge an
attack from behind.

248
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,361
In other words he's got
360-degree x-ray vision.

249
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:30,763
On top of that
there's that jutsu.

250
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:34,867
-All right.

251
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:40,373
Summoning jutsu!

252
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,883
-I warn you, kid.

253
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,919
However strong
your defenses are,

254
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,321
I can find a way around it.

255
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,262
KIDOMARU (VOICEOVER): If he
can block the physical attacks

256
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:07,400
by emitting lots of
chakra and rotating

257
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:10,536
then all I have to do
is stop that rotation.

258
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,207
NARUTO: This fight
took second place?

259
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:16,475
SAKURA: Yep.

260
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,678
Two sharp minds pitted
against one another.

261
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:19,512
NARUTO: Eh.

262
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,713
I dunno.

263
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:23,249
The slow, plodding stuff
isn't really my cup of tea.

264
00:14:23,282 --> 00:14:24,617
SAKURA: How come?

265
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,752
NARUTO: Well, it's just--
when I'm watching a fight,

266
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:27,987
I wanna see some action.

267
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,288
Bodies in motion.

268
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:30,456
A real slug-fest, you know?

269
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:31,857
SAKURA: But there's
more to being

270
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:33,326
a ninja than just taijutsu.

271
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,360
NARUTO: Hey, watch it.

272
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,696
That's being rude to bushy-brow.

273
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:37,396
SAKURA: Oh.

274
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,497
Sorry.

275
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,399
NARUTO: That's what I'm
talking about, anyway.

276
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,501
Something fiery like
bushy-brow would do.

277
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:44,570
That's what Neji's
battles are missing.

278
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,405
All the fire.

279
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:47,740
-Now!

280
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,508
NARUTO: It's too thought-out.

281
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,611
Too-- logical, or something.

282
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:55,815
He should just jump in there
and flatten his opponent.

283
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,416
-It's because you
think like that

284
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,886
that missions are
such a chore with you.

285
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,288
-Neji!

286
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,323
-And now a few words
from Neji of the Hyuga

287
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:07,593
clan, our second-place finalist.

288
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:08,728
-This is just silly.

289
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:12,431
You're free to evaluate
my battle, I suppose.

290
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:16,836
But participating in this
farce is utterly beneath me.

291
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:18,337
-Whatever.

292
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:19,972
At least you get to
preen like you always do.

293
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:21,440
Oh, wait.

294
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:23,876
I bet it's an appearance
fee you're after, huh?

295
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,578
It's too bad for you, then.

296
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:28,314
We're doing this as a thank
you to all the fans out there.

297
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:32,218
So your appearance on the
show is pro-bono, buddy.

298
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,786
-That isn't a problem.

299
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,354
I've spoken with the Hokage.

300
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,890
She's deemed my being
here as a mission.

301
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:39,592
I had no choice but to show up.

302
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:44,196
And since it is a mission, I'm
of course being compensated.

303
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,331
-Boy.

304
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:46,966
Practical as ever,
aren't you, Neji?

305
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,534
-You're tell me you
got paid for this?

306
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,770
How is that supposed to be fair!

307
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:52,238
-Just face it, will you?

308
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,373
My brain is built
differently than your own.

309
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:57,843
Gentle Fist!

310
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,750
-It seems that the big board
is out of commission so

311
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:07,553
why don't we cut to the chase
and announce number one?

312
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:10,322
Which epic battle managed
to come out on top?

313
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,230
-Chidori.

314
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:19,598
NARUTO: No surprises here.

315
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,600
It wouldn't have made sense
if the top battle wasn't

316
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:23,202
one of mine.

317
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,336
SAKURA: Yeah.

318
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:25,638
I don't think
there's anybody out

319
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,741
there who doesn't feel
this should be number one.

320
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:29,408
-Rasengan!

321
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:58,971
-Chidori!

322
00:16:59,205 --> 00:16:59,638
-Rasengan!

323
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,281
-So how about it?

324
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,283
Was everyone out there
able to guess right?

325
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:46,752
The greatest battle of
all time was brought to us

326
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,754
by none other than Sasuke!

327
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:50,322
-Hey, hold on a minute, there.

328
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:53,192
I think you might have this
turned around a little bit.

329
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:53,893
-Turned around?

330
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,728
What's that mean?

331
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:56,595
-Forget it.

332
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:57,963
It's not important.

333
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,331
Alrighty, then.

334
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:00,833
Let's get this train
back on the tracks

335
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:03,269
and check out a little
bonus footage of yours truly

336
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:04,470
in action.

337
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,872
Eat your hearts out,
two through five!

338
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,274
-You idiot!

339
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:09,742
-Say what?

340
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:11,577
What the heck is this?

341
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,779
What happened to
the tape I put in?

342
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:15,681
It's not what I prepared at all.

343
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:16,916
Stop the tape!

344
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,250
Wait, don't look at this!

345
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:19,351
I get top billing here.

346
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,487
Now cut the tape,
do you hear me?

347
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,523
-Oh, stop making
such a fuss, already.

348
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:27,193
And now the moment has arrived.

349
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,727
It's time to meet
our special guest.

350
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,797
We bring you live and on
location to our correspondent

351
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,799
master Jiraiya.

352
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,934
-Ah!

353
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,869
-Can you hear me
out there, Jiraiya?

354
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,237
-Absolutely.

355
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,872
I'm picking you both
up loud and clear.

356
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,874
-Now tell us, are
you able to talk

357
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:44,510
about where you
are at the moment?

358
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:45,477
-Hm.

359
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:46,712
I'm kind of in a
tricky spot, here.

360
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:49,648
I can't divulge the
details of my location.

361
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,350
The most I can tell
you is that I'm

362
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:53,986
in a certain someone's
secret hidden lair.

363
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,455
-What's the deal
here, pervy sage?

364
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,923
What are you doing
outside of the village?

365
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,826
I thought you were supposed to
be overseeing my training right

366
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,727
now.

367
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:02,795
-Oh come on, Naruto.

368
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:04,196
This is a special episode.

369
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:05,965
Stop being a stick
in the mud, will ya?

370
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:09,735
And anyway, get a load of the
guest I've rustled up for us.

371
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:12,905
None other than Orochimaru.

372
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,206
-Huh?

373
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,608
What's going on around here?

374
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:18,244
Did you know this
was gonna happen?

375
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:19,712
-This is quite a surprise.

376
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:21,480
Orochimaru.

377
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:22,882
-Oh, it's a pleasure, dear.

378
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:26,619
But what a shame you didn't
invite me into the studio.

379
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:27,519
-You can't be serious.

380
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:30,222
As if we'd ever invite you here!

381
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,657
-Right you are.

382
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,393
We'd have been too busy anyway,
what with all our research

383
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:36,328
and amassing of jutsu.

384
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,763
I'm sure that you understand.

385
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,666
After all, I need Sasuke
to advance his strength

386
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,601
as quickly as possible.

387
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:46,205
-If-- if he's there--
then let us see him!

388
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,574
-Oh, believe, I tried
to get your young friend

389
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,876
to participate a little,
what with today being

390
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:52,878
a special occasion
and everything.

391
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:55,414
But sadly he's
ignoring me and has

392
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,716
chosen to mope the day away.

393
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,550
-Oh.

394
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,752
-Hey.

395
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,921
Are you gonna go on all day?

396
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:07,660
I came here to train, not to
waste my time, Orochimaru.

397
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:08,627
-Sasuke.

398
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:09,895
-It is you.

399
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,364
It is you, isn't it?

400
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:15,734
-I'm gonna head over to the
training hall right now.

401
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,403
Don't make me wait.

402
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:18,604
-Wait!

403
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:19,672
-Well goodness, now.

404
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:22,408
You've gonna and angered
my young protege.

405
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:25,844
I'll have to bid my
farewell, then, I guess.

406
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:26,845
-No, wait!

407
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,414
Put Sasuke back on again!

408
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,850
-Sakura-- I'm pretty sure
he can't hear you anymore.

409
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:32,818
-Yeah, I know.

410
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,954
You're right.

411
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:36,188
-Sakura--

412
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,589
-No, you're right.

413
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:38,357
OK.

414
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,525
On with the show.

415
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,827
Well, it's time to
say our goodbyes.

416
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,462
We're so glad yo could be here.

417
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:45,464
Thanks so much to
everyone for watching

418
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:46,732
and for all your support.

419
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,701
We hope you enjoyed all
the thrills, the spills,

420
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:51,737
and everything in between,
here on our top five big battle

421
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,472
countdown.

422
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:54,573
-Uh, hey.

423
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:55,908
You can't close the show
on your own like that.

424
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:57,409
And what about the
footage I was gonna

425
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:58,978
show of me kicking some butt?

426
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:00,612
-We don't have
time for all that.

427
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:03,215
Just take us to
commercial break, OK?

428
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:03,916
-What?

429
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:04,817
Man.

430
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,584
All right.

431
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:06,452
Whatever.

432
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:07,619
Well, sorry about that, folks.

433
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,455
It looks like my
little fighting montage

434
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:11,190
will have to wait
till next time.

435
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:12,458
But you can all
rest assured, I'll

436
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,694
be knocking your
socks off in no time.

437
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:16,929
-Anyway, thanks, everyone.

438
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:20,265
-We hope you'll all
keep watching Naruto.

439
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,967
See ya later, everybody.

440
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:22,634
Buh-bye!

were such a stubborn fool.

-Well, your yelling
won't change anything.

she's gonna dump us.
