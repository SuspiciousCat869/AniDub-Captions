[theme music]

2
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,916
-What did you say?

3
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:01,016
You mean you sent
Genin after Sasuke?

4
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,649
-Well, what else could I do?

5
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:05,683
You know the state that this
village is in right now.

6
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:11,716
[sigh]

7
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,949
-Anyway, I have a
contingency plan in place.

8
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,949
Hey, where are you going?

9
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:25,349
You already have a
mission assigned to you.

10
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:27,683
KAKASHI: I have to go
run an errand first.

11
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:29,049
Be back in a bit.

12
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:29,683
Don't worry.

13
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,083
-Oh, brother.

14
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:47,049
-Kakashi-sensei, Kakashi-sensei.

15
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,183
It's already been
two full days now

16
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:52,349
since Sasuke left the village.

17
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:55,749
Naruto and the others
haven't come back.

18
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:58,149
And Lee's out there too.

19
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:58,983
-I know.

20
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:02,316
I'm pretty much up to speed now.

21
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,949
-Sensei, I-- I have
faith in Naruto, I do.

22
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,416
I believe in him.

23
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,949
But if anything were to
happen to those two, I--

24
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:17,283
-Sakura, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

25
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,549
Just leave it to me.

26
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,683
Summoning Jutsu.

27
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:52,316
OK guys, fan out
and start searching

28
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,783
for Naruto and Sasuke's scent.

29
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:58,049
-Did you say Naruto and Sasuke?

30
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,083
What's going on?

31
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,749
What happened to
the two of them?

32
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,449
-I'll explain later.

33
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,249
Right now, time
is of the essence.

34
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,016
-Right.

35
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,349
KAKASHI: Let me know as soon
as you pick up their scent.

36
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,149
I'll be there immediately.

37
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,149
All right, scatter.

38
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:26,016
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Well,
they did go at each other right

39
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,116
before her eyes.

40
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:31,383
Guess there's no point in
telling her not to worry.

41
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:36,683
[screaming]

42
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:37,649
-Stop!

43
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:38,149
No!

44
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,116
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Damn.

45
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,049
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Can't stop.

46
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:46,516
-No!

47
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:07,216
-Let it go.

48
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,416
You've got to forget
about revenge.

49
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,383
-What?

50
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:15,583
-Even if you attain it, all
you will find is emptiness.

51
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,716
-Shut up.

52
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,783
What makes you think you
know anything about it?

53
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,149
It's easy for you to talk.

54
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:21,916
You have no idea.

55
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:22,916
-Easy.

56
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,583
Just try to calm down.

57
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,949
So it looks like neither of us
has led a charmed life exactly,

58
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:31,516
have we?

59
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:35,249
Still, we're not
all that bad off.

60
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:37,049
At least you and I
have been lucky enough

61
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,683
to find new comrades
to help fill the void.

62
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:46,449
Anyway, I do know how you feel.

63
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,383
With the Chidori,
you've been granted

64
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,283
a gift of awesome power.

65
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:54,549
It's not a power to be
used against your comrade,

66
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,049
or to seek vengeance.

67
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:01,516
I think in your heart of
hearts, you know what it's for.

68
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,349
-I'll win no matter what.

69
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:06,916
-I'm not finished with you yet.

70
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,849
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
I was too naive.

71
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,349
Those two could end
up killing each other.

72
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:13,783
[dog howling]

73
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:14,283
-Hm?

74
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,316
-Kakashi-sensei.

75
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,783
-I hope I'm not too late.

76
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,649
SASUKE: I know I said
this already, but be

77
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:52,883
honest with yourself.

78
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,683
You've been waiting
for this moment too.

79
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,449
Kakashi and Sakura
aren't here now.

80
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:03,816
Nobody's going to stop
us like the last time.

81
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:04,549
-You lousy--

82
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:11,516
-This time we settle
it once and for all.

83
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:12,883
It will be the end of you!

84
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:23,649
Chidori!

85
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,549
-You idiot.

86
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,649
Right back at you, pal.

87
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,449
I'll beat you into
oblivion if that's

88
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:41,316
what it's going to take
to bring you back home.

89
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,583
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

90
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:56,949
Rasengan!

91
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,683
-Our time together
wasn't meaningless.

92
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:46,249
One thing was worthwhile--
our friendship.

93
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:47,949
We became best friends.

94
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:50,349
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke
actually came out and said that

95
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,816
to me.

96
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:55,049
And now, I'm going to put it
to the test with this Rasengan.

97
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,883
Sasuke, what's happened to you?

98
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,516
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

99
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:50,016
He was able to counter my
Chidori at its full power.

100
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:06,883
-Damn it.

101
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,849
Naruto, how far have you--

102
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,816
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
You pathetic loser.

103
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:25,749
Naruto.

104
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:39,616
-So, looks like you're
good for two bursts.

105
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:43,549
That's about your limit.

106
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,149
-What would happen if I tried
to use it more than twice?

107
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,849
-Well for one thing,
it wouldn't work.

108
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:58,416
But remember this, if you try to
force a jutsu, not only will it

109
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,783
not work, but the
attempt can drain

110
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:03,716
your chakra to absolute zero.

111
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:06,549
Worst case scenario, you die.

112
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,816
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I
can't waste another blow.

113
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,983
It would be pointless.

114
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:14,083
All we'll do is cancel
each other out again.

115
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,949
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That's it.

116
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,949
There's no mistaking it now.

117
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:34,483
You're dead serious
about this, aren't you?

118
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:47,237
You really mean to--

119
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,157
Sasuke.

120
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:07,677
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I have to
use some of my faster jutsu

121
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,577
to create an opening.

122
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,044
And then I'll hit
him with Chidori.

123
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,510
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

124
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:32,877
-You know what they
say, don't you, Naruto?

125
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,110
When two shinobi
are powerful enough,

126
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:37,744
they are able to read each
other's thoughts simply

127
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:45,844
by an exchange of fists, without
ever uttering a single word.

128
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:46,844
Get it?

129
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,910
You've always been
naive, Naruto.

130
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:04,277
Tell me, do you
know my thoughts?

131
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,444
Can you tell what's on my mind?

132
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:12,210
Fire Style Phoenix Flower Jutsu.

133
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:35,744
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Sasuke, I always knew

134
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:38,144
that you were alone.

135
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:42,610
At first, when I realized
there was someone else like me

136
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:45,044
around, I was relieved.

137
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:52,044
And happy too.

138
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:55,944
To tell the truth, I wanted to
approach you right off the bat.

139
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:06,744
But I just couldn't
work up the nerve.

140
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:07,710
-Whoa.

141
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:08,344
-Sasuke.

142
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:09,710
-Did you see that?

143
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:12,110
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): You were
always able to do everything,

144
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,610
and everyone was always
fawning over you.

145
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:34,210
You were so far ahead of me,
and I didn't want to admit it,

146
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,277
so I started to see
you as my rival.

147
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:43,010
I didn't want to lose to you.

148
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:45,744
And with everyone
calling me a loser,

149
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:49,644
it just made things worse.

150
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:55,744
Even when we became Squad 7, I
never stopped feeling that way.

151
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:59,944
I was stubborn, and I couldn't
express what I really felt.

152
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:09,010
The truth was I really
just wanted to be like you.

153
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:14,144
You were-- you were
everything I aspire to.

154
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:16,910
That's why--

155
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:20,610
-You're one of the ones
I want to fight the most.

156
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,077
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
You have no idea

157
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,210
how happy you made me that day.

158
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:30,677
It was the first time you ever
said anything acknowledging me.

159
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,444
You and I don't need
to come to blows

160
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:43,777
to know each other's
thoughts anyway.

161
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,544
Ever since that day, even
though we've never said it,

162
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:54,610
the truth is you
and I are friends.

163
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:03,444
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): It's
not insignificant to me.

164
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:10,010
There's no question--
you're my closest friend.

165
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,444
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
But now you're

166
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:15,377
seriously trying to take me out.

167
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,810
And I don't really
know if you meant

168
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,777
what you said before or not.

169
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,810
Maybe I was the only
one who thought--

170
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:34,210
who thought that
we were friends.

171
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,477
-I told you, it's
too late, Naruto.

172
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,944
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
If that's the case,

173
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:57,010
then-- then how stupid am I?

174
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:00,244
Sasuke.

175
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,244
I-- I can't help it.

176
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,510
I don't know why.

177
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:14,244
I don't know why,
but-- but I-- I just

178
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:19,544
I don't know why,
but-- but I-- I just

179
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:27,677
can't bear the thought
of seeing you taken away

180
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,777
by someone like Orochimaru.

181
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,310
-You managed to divert the
blow with your left hand

182
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,310
at the last second.

183
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:53,277
But in the end, it
doesn't matter, does it?

184
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,977
You're finished anyway.

185
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,944
You can forget all about hand
signs and that jutsu of yours.

186
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:09,144
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
This is the end.

187
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,510
What is this red chakra?

188
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,477
Where is he getting
this kind of power?

189
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,244
What is this?

190
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:34,210
The wound in his
shoulder, it's vanishing.

191
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:35,710
I don't believe it.

192
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,044
-Sasuke.

193
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:11,444
I'm not letting
Orochimaru take you away.

194
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,177
Do you understand me?

195
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,544
I'll break every single
bone in your body

196
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,177
if that's what it
takes to stop you!

197
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,810
You're not going anywhere!

198
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,437
[theme music]

199
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:04,220
[screaming]

200
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,153
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I've
heard enough of this.

201
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,620
I don't care what
you're thinking.

202
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,420
This ends now.

203
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:13,086
Orochimaru's now getting
his hands on you.

204
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,920
You're going back to
the Hidden Leaf Village

205
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:18,786
if I have to drag you
all the way there!

206
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:26,522
Sasuke, you are my-- Next
time-- A Plea From a Friend.
