--[chuckling] Well,
well, that was close.

00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:37,462
I know if I take just one

25
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:42,195
Fist of yours, my whole chakra
network goes out of whack.

26

You keep me on my toes, kid.

00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:49,828
-That material, where does
it come from, you monster?

-Impressive, yes?

29
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:55,295
My sticky spider thread is
actually a type of metal

30

that hardens the instant
it leaves my body.

31
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,462
It's impervious to chakra.

32
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:04,595
And, what's more, not only can
I secret it from my mouth as

you've seen, but from every
sweat gland in my body.

NEJI: That explains it.

35
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:23,195
No wonder my attacks on his
chakra points have no effect.

How did he see it coming?

up with us, got it?

What kind of a
freak is this guy?

Come out.

MALE SPEAKER: It's those eyes.

73
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:59,728
The chakra flow is not the
only thing they can see.

74
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:04,062
The power of his visual
jutsu is beyond belief!

75
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,728
NEJI: Long distance combat
is not to my advantage.

76
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:10,295
I've got to get
closer to him somehow.

77
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:11,495
MALE SPEAKER: OK, then!

78
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,662
I give you credit.

79
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,762
You've made this game

80
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:23,562
than I thought it would be.

81
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:25,828
Time to start playing for real.

82
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,128
NEJI: He's like a totally
different opponent!

83
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:36,328
His chakra activity's
staggering!

84
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:37,795
And those markings.

85
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:50,595
MALE SPEAKER: So, this guy's
able to see me in the dark

86
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:53,462
and to dodge an
attack from behind.

87
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:58,128
In other words, he's got
360-degree X-ray vision.

88
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:02,962
On top of that,
there's that jutsu.

89
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:03,495
All right.

90
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:09,662
Summoning Jutsu!

91
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,062
-Nngh.

92
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,562
-I warned you, kid.

93
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,462
However strong
your defenses are,

94
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,695
I can find a way around it.

95
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:34,295
If he can block the
physical attacks

96
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:39,828
by emitting lots of chakra and
rotating, then all I have to do

97
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,295
is to stop that rotation.

98
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:44,428
Scatter!

99
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:50,828
-Nngh.

100
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:56,762
Rotation!

00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:07,128
-[chuckling] There.

102
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:10,095
That slowed him down.

103
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:10,595
-Nngh.

104
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:17,962
-Now!

105
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:31,929
Now you die!

106
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:47,363
[growling] He slowed my dagger
with chakra at the last second!

107
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,129
NEJI: Neh.

108
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:53,096
What?

109
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,963
His web stopped my rotation.

110
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,196
Our chakra canceled
each other out!

111
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,129
Hmm.

112
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,496
Enough of this.

113
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,329
If my Rotation Jutsu
won't work, I'll

114
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,063
just have to cut the
threads one by one!

115
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:11,429
MALE SPEAKER: His strength
is close-range taijutsu.

116
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:16,196
So as long as I keep my
distance, I'm all right.

117
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:19,229
Just keep pounding away at him.

118
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,196

time in the world.

The number of blows has doubled!

If he gets the chance to use
that on me, I'm finished.

-Guh.

144
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:40,363
MALE SPEAKER: So
that's how it is!

145
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,596
He's been anticipating
my attacks

146
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,796
by combining his X-ray vision
with telescopic long-range

147
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,929
vision, as well as a
360-degree line of sight.

148
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,796
Add to all that his
lightning-fast reflexes

149
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:00,229
and this kid's got an almost
impenetrable defensive barrier.

150
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:03,229
Judging from his reaction
time during that last attack,

151
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,329
he's able to see and
react to the kunai knives

152
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:09,029
once they get within 50
meters of his position,

153
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:10,463
but not quite all.

154
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,796
Somehow or another, one
of them got through.

155
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,529
And that means
there's a blind spot!

-Eight Trigrams, 64-- aaugh!

-Yeah.

told you I'd find a way around

your defenses!

169
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,929
Actually, right
through your defenses!

170
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:35,596
All those fancy moves of yours,
they're all just an attempt

171
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:39,363
to hide your blind
spot, aren't they?

172
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,229
Those eyes don't quite
see everything, do they?

00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,596
Why bother?

176
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,663
The game's over!

-What is the point?

179
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:12,229
What the heck do you
hope to accomplish?

180
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,063
Don't make this messier
than it has to be!

181
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:17,296
Just roll over and
die, why don't you!

182
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,729
You can't beat me!

--[sighing] Lee, you just don't
know when to give up, do you?

187
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,563
You're never going
to able to beat him

188
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,229
because Neji's
something you're not.

189
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,696
He's a genius.

190
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:42,863
-A genius?

191
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,496
I do not care what he is!

192
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,263
Even without his
talent, I can still

193
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,563
take him if I just
work hard enough.

194
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,429
-It's no use, Lee.

195

-Huh?

196

-It doesn't matter how hard you
work, you will never beat me.

The outcome has been decided.

00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,563
Hinata, you are the
pampered offspring

199
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:03,463
of the Hyuga's main branch.

200
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:06,029
People can't change, no
matter how hard they try.

201
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,529
This match is the same.

202

Your destiny was
decided the moment

203
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:17,929
I was chosen as your opponent.

-Oh yeah?

205
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,629

until you beat me, will we?

was predictable.

and he's still standing?

230
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,663
I'll have to work on my aim.

231
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:37,196
This kid is something else.

232
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:41,196
He's turning out to be a lot
more entertaining than I ever

233
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,396
dreamed!

234
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,729
I'll have to demonstrate
my appreciation.

-I don't expect much
from that slob, Jirobo,

237
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,863
but what the heck
is keeping Kidomaru?

238
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,929
He shoulda caught up by now.

00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:10,429
-You know how we always plays
about with his opponents.

240
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:13,329
He likes to keep things fun.

241
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,663
-Gives me the creeps
when he does that.

242
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:20,629
Too much fun and he goes off his
head and reaches Second State.

243
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:23,863
-[chuckling] Oh, indeed.

244
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,163
And when Kidomaru
reaches Second State,

245
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,829
watch out if you're
the other guy.

NEJI: There's no
wasted effort with him!

251
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,618
He learns something
from every attack,

252
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,151
and then uses what
he learns against me!

Even my Byakugan is
no secret to him.

This is the strongest
opponent I've ever faced.

I've hit the wall.

His next attack
could be the last.

257
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:23,118
I haven't the strength to
elude it, but I will not run!

I will not hide!
