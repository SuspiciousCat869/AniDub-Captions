00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:08,917
-We're getting close.

3
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,617
NEJI: That's strange.

4
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,417
It's been quite a long
time, and we still

5
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,017
haven't encountered
a single trap.

6
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,150
Well, Shikamaru.

7
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:31,184
What's your assessment?

8
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,384
-It looks to me like
we've been underestimated.

9
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,784
They're cocky.

10
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:38,317
They think we're all dead now,
and their big guys the only one

11
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,117
following them.

12
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,417
They don't need to set a trap
for their own man, do they?

13
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,184
-Those idiots.

14
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:46,550
They think we're so weak.

15
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,717
-It seems you're right
about our enemy, Shikamaru,

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,850
and it's insulting to be
underestimated like this.

17
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:54,984
But still.

18
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,084
This could be our chance.

19
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,117
-I hear you.

20
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,550
Now we can take
them by surprise.

-Jirobo's pretty late, isn't he?

23
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,217
-He was, but he just arrived.

24
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,717
-Well, it's about time.

25
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,684
You were gone a while.

26
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,717
What took so long?

27
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,750
-Sorry.

28
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:46,284
It took longer than I thought
to eat all that loser's chakra.

29

-Listen, fatso.

30
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,217
Don't slow us down
so you can eat more.

31
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,417
You see that coffin?

32
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,084
You're the one who's
supposed to be carrying it.

33
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,850
So do your job, you slob!

34
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:00,350
OK.

35
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,817
-Well, well, Jirobo.

36
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,117
Aren't you awfully
easygoing today?

37
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,684
-Yeah, so what?

38
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,284
-Well, it's just
that I'm not going

39
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:18,384
to be handing over this coffin
to you, because you're not

40
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,217
the real Jirobo!

down this one, fellas.

Sakon, Tayuya, go on.

43
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:34,084
I'll catch up.

44
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:41,884
The real Chirobo
is always scolding

45
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,117
Tayuya about her
rather coarse language.

46
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,850
-You got me.

Huh?

50
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,084
-Surprised to see me?

51
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:12,750
-Ninja Art.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Kiba, Akamaru.

55
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,350
Now's your chance.

56
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:24,950
When he's in midair
like that, there's

57
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:27,584
no way he can fight back!

58
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:29,050
KIBA: Fang Over Fang!

I won't let you get away!

-You stole my line, punk.

61

You should look
down at your feet.

-You coward!

63
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:54,250
Do you really think you
can't stop us that easily?

64
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:57,550
-Why don't you shut up?

65
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,117
-Where is he?

66
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,117
-What could that fatso be doing?

67
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,317
This stinks!

68
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,184
-We did leave the
weakest one behind

69
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,850
to take care of those brats.

70
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,684
Perhaps that was a mistake.

71
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,617
NEJI (VOICEOVER): My turn.

72
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:30,750
-Neji!

73
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:31,384
No!

74
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,250
-He'a stuck!

75
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,550
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Darn it.

76
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,217
He got me, Naruto,
Kiba, and Neji.

77
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,117
We followed the plan,
but it's not working.

78
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:56,784
-How'd you like to see the
inside of an air tight cocoon?

79
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:03,884
-No!

80
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:09,784
Come on.

81
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:10,784
Come on!

82
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,017
What the heck's this
thread made out of?

83
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,584
I can't cut it!

84
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,350
-It's useless.

85
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:24,450
My spider silk is so powerful,
nothing can break it.

86
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:26,484
Two elephants couldn't
pull it apart.

87
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,484
That one's able to
use shadow clone.

88

NEJI (VOICEOVER):
No matter what I

89
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,917
do, this thread
keeps sticking to me.

90
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,850
This stickiness must come
from combining his chakra

91
00:07:51,884 --> 00:07:54,084
with some sort of fluid.

92
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:56,784
And the strength is unreal.

93
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,684
Even after he
releases the thread,

94
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:02,517
his chakra is still flowing
through it, giving it power.

95
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,317
Impossible.

96
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,184
The level of this jutsu
is out of this world.

97
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:10,650
It's unstoppable.

98
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,117
No, wait.

99
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,050
I've got to calm down.

100
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,217
Focus my chakra.

101
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,417
-Ninja Art.

102
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,817
Sticky Spider Thread.

103
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,084
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): That's a
different color from the thread

104
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,950
he used before.

105
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:40,884
What's he gonna do?

106
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:52,984
I see.

107
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:53,684
It's solidifying.

108
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,550
-Since you'll be
my first victim,

109
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,417
let's make this entertaining.

110
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,450
I'm going to play a little game
to find out which one of you

111
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:04,617
is the real one.

112
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,684
-What did you just say?

113
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:12,217
-Contestant one, let's
try you at the end.

114
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,117
-No, Naruto!

115
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,817
-Oh well, looks
like he was a clone.

116
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,650
No problem.

117
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,584
Let's try another!

118
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,184
Whichever you are,
you're pretty lucky.

119
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:31,317
Next, let's try two at a time.

120
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,350
The odds will be
doubled in my favor!

121
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,184
You are a very lucky
guy, you know that?

122
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,784
But this time, I got 50-50 shot.

123
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,250
Here it comes!

124
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:09,550
Well, somehow he made it all
the way to the bitter end.

125
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:12,617
Well, weakling, it was
fun playing with you,

126
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,750
but unfortunately, the
game's over for you now.

127
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:21,050
Now die!

128
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,484
One down, and three to go.

129
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:31,850
Wait, where did he--

130
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:34,284
[shout]

131
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:45,017
-Of course.

132
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,150
He let his shadow
clones get caught,

133
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:49,584
while the real one hid
and waited for a chance

134
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:51,850
to catch me off guard.

135
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,717
For a wimp like
that to to come up

136
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,550
with such a deception
in the heat of battle--

137
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,117
He's not so dumb after all.

138
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:07,717
However-- It looks like you're
at the end of your rope.

139
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,184
How did he--

140
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:14,017
-Naruto!

141
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,550
Thanks for stalling him for me.

142
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:19,050
-Neji!

143
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:21,017
-I trapped you.

144
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,684
How did you get free?

145
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,017
-Arf!

146
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,284
-Your spiderweb
had a chakra base.

147
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:30,884
And chakra built
substances don't

148
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:35,417
stand a chance against
my Gentle Fist attack.

149
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,884
This guy's jutsu-- I think I'm
the only one who can handle it.

150
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,450
Go on, you guys.

151
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,917
I'll take care of him.

152
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:10,265
[whimpering]

153
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:13,815
-What's wrong, buddy?

154
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,282
Hey, wait, Akamaru.

155
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:19,115
Well, looks like this guy's
stronger than that big guy

156
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,215
we fought before.

157
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:22,049
Much stronger.

158
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,449
-We're going to have
to go one on one

159
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,315
to have any chance for success.

160
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,849
Isn't that what you said?

161
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,549
-Yeah.

162
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,982
That's what we agreed.

163
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,382
-And besides, if
we all stay here,

164
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,215
we won't be able to
catch up with Sasuke.

165
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,682
-But what about Choji?

166
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,649
He hasn't come back.

167
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:49,149
-Arf!

168
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:57,282
-We all embarked on this mission
to find Sasuke and bring him

169
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:59,582
back home to the village.

170
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:02,449
But that's not the only
reason that we've come.

171
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,982
We are on this mission to
protect a fellow shinobi,

172
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:10,482
to defend the bond of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

173
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:14,849
At the Third Hokage's
funeral, when Ikruka spoke,

174
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:16,049
do you remember his words?

175
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:28,149
-Iruka-sensei,
why do they do it?

176
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,782
Why do people risk their
lives for other people?

177
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:39,482
-Well, when someone
passes away, it's the end.

178
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:43,949
His past and future, all
the dreams he once had,

179
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,915
they disappear along with him.

180
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:50,282
This is true, even if he
dies honorably in battle,

181
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:53,249
as so many have.

182
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,015
As Hayate did.

183
00:13:57,115 --> 00:14:00,549
All of the ties that bind him
to the living are severed.

184
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:06,615
All but one, the most
important of all-- people.

185
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:11,515
Parents, siblings,
friends, lovers.

186
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,749
The people who were
important to him.

187
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:18,582
And these people,
the ones left behind,

188
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:21,315
are joined together
in a great circle

189
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:23,849
by their shared memories of him.

190
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,649
A circle of friendship,
trust, and sacrifice

191
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:31,515
that grows larger and
stronger as time passes.

192
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,782
It's hard to explain it.

193
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:36,015
We remain in the
circle together.

194
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,815
We have no choice.

195
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,249
It's important to us.

196
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:48,882
-Listen.

197
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:52,615
Sasuke's out there right now,
heading toward Orochimaru.

198
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,015
We can't allow such evil to
take someone from our village.

199
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,282
That is not our way.

200
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:10,349
What's more-- Naruto.

201
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:16,082
What's more-- Naruto.

202
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,015
Sometimes your eyes are
even better than mind.

203
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:34,215
Wherever he is, Sasuke
in the darkness.

204
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:46,849
Now, get going.

205
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,015
I'll be right behind you.

206
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:55,815
-Well, all right.

207
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,649
Let's do this thing.

208
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:02,282
-When you catch up with us,
make sure you bring Choji, too.

209
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:03,249
-Of course I will.

210
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:18,115
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Neji--
I'd better see you again.

211
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,949
-Oh, no you don't!

212
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:28,482
-Byakugan!

213
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:36,649
-Incoming!

214
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:50,449
-He's pretty good.

215
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,915
This is gonna be fun.

216
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,315
-Thanks, Neji.

217
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,015
-Yep.

218
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:57,815
That's him, all right.

219
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:02,249
-Not so fast.

220
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:03,949
I won't let you
escape that easily.

221
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:09,815
-If you want them, you'll
have to go through me.

222
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:16,615
Not good enough.

223
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,949
-Well, that's just fine by me.

224
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:25,849
Besides, you're by far the
strongest one of the lot.

225
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,915
Aw, man.

226
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,349
I'm really itching
to play with you.

227
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:36,849
And we should play slowly, or
else the game's not as fun.

228
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:47,210
[laughter]

229
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:02,682
OK, the game is I'll kill you

230
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,849
in three minutes or less.

231
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:05,149
Ha.

232
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:06,215
You're not going anywhere.

233
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,215
For a wimp, you're pretty good
at handling chakra, aren't ya?

234
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:18,649
And those eyes of
yours are pretty sharp.

235
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:22,182
You fire off chakra from the
chakra points in your hands

236
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:23,515
like a sharp needle.

237
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,882
Then you target the thin
part of my thread with chakra

238
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:31,049
running through it,
and strike there.

239
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,115
Yes, I heard this
from Lord Orochimaru.

240
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,649
It's the technique
you call Gentle Fist.

241
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:37,149
Right?

242
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:42,949
But if you can't use those
annoying hands of yours,

243
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,949
then you won't be able
to cut through my silk!

244
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,415
That was way too easy.

245
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:53,315
Once you figure out your
opponent's rules of engagement,

246
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:56,382
games like this one
are no longer amusing.

247
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,482
It's only been in
a minute or so,

248
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:00,849
and I'm already tired
of playing with you.

249
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:17,749
[sigh]

250
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:18,249
-Die.

251
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:23,782
Sticky Spider Thread!

252
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:42,049
Huh?

253
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:57,349
How did he--

254
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,082
-I suppose you want me to
explain how I broke free.

255
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:03,615
You see, it's not just my hands.

256
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,882
There are chakra
points all over me.

257
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:09,115
I can emit chakra from any one.

258
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:12,682
And now, as you
would say, game over!

259
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:21,315
Gentle Fist Art, Eight
Trigrams, 64 Palms!

260
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,557
[theme music]

261
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:05,979
NEJI: The attack on his
chakra points was ineffective.

262
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,646
On top of that, he fell back
to a long distance attack

263
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,213
to avoid my Gentle Fist.

264
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:13,279
This guy blocks my every
move, and he reads my hands

265
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,113
instantly.

266
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,513
This could be bad.

267
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:19,213
The longer this fight drags on,
the less likely I am to win it.

268
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:22,613
And if he notices
my weakness, then--

269
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:25,879
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, 360 Degrees of Vision.

270
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:29,313
The Byakugan's Blind Spot!

271
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:32,846
[theme music]
