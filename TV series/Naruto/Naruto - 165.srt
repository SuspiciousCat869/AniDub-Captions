[theme music]

2
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:02,344
-Kakashi-sensei.

3
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:07,976
-We've finished our mission
in the Land of Birds.

4
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,609
We're done here.

5
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:10,776
-What about Naruto?

6
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:12,243
We just leave him?

7
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,843
-It's all my fault.

8
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:16,609
I was team leader.

9
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:21,709
-Sacrifice is an unavoidable
part of the shinobi way.

10
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:25,543
Now then, let's get back
to the Leaf Village.

11
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:41,176
-Do you believe they're
really headed back

12
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,943
to their village, Nagare?

13
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,743
-Could be.

14
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,009
-Hm.

15
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,776
The one in the mask who
joined them later worries me.

16
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,276
-If you want me to
follow them, I will.

17
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:55,009
-No.

18
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:56,543
Leave that to me.

19
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,109
Go on and report back.

20
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:58,609
-Right.

21
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,909
-What do you have to report?

22
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,976
-The two younger ones, along
with the tall one in the mask,

23
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,343
have all been seen
crossing the border.

24
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,743
They appear to be headed back
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

25
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:35,909
-Very good.

26
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:38,743
And Lord Sagi's taken
care of their companion,

27
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:41,709
that persistent little pest
who snuck into the palace.

28
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,876
Very good, indeed.

29
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,543
-They've been there
for a half hour.

30
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,309
What are they doing?

31
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:01,209
-Oh, yummy, yummy.

32
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:01,809
-That's mine!

33
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:06,576
-I won!

34
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,109
-Wait a minute.

35
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:18,843
Of course.

36
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,409
A substitution.

37
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,809
Think you're clever, eh?

38
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:28,009
Playing me for a fool?

39
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:53,043
-My Lord Kome.

40
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:53,909
It's time.

41
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,976
-A verdict has been
reached, Lord Kome.

42
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:48,109
Betraying your position
as chief tactician

43
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:52,509
to our late Lord Owashi, you
conspired in his assassination,

44
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:55,576
as well as the murder of
his daughter, Lady Toki.

45
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:57,676
Furthermore, you and
your subordinates

46
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,543
were responsible
for manufacturing

47
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,809
the apparition known as the
Cursed Warrior, your purpose

48
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:05,343
being to spread panic
among our people,

49
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:08,376
undermine the
authority of Lord Sagi,

50
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,943
and usurp his role as the feudal
lord of the Land of Birds.

51
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:13,276
You are a traitor.

52
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,543
Lord Kome, you're commanded
to take your own life!

53
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:24,943
[gasping]

54
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:30,276
[laughter]

55
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,409
-So that's it, Moso?

56
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,443
I see it all now.

57
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:40,076
you've sprung your
trap, haven't you?

58
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,109
-I'm disappointed, Kome!

59
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:45,476
If you're a warrior, then
at least die like one.

60
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,509
Help him to carry
out his sentence.

61
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,476
-My lord.

62
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,343
KOME (VOICEOVER):
So this is the end.

63
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:21,743
-What?

64
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,209
What's this?

65
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,143
Is this the Hidden Mist Jutsu?

66
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:25,809
No, wait.

67
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:26,709
It's something else.

68
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,309
-Never mind the formalities!

69
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:34,109
Kill him!

70
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,009
-Yes, sir.

71
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:35,909
Forgive me, Lord Kome.

72
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,843
-Who's there?

73
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:41,909
-Who is it?

74
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:44,576
What the-- what the
devil is going on?

75
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,243
CROWD: The Cursed Warrior!

76
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,909
-The Cursed Warrior, huh?

77
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:55,476
-Yes.

78
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,176
-Quick.

79
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,209
Don't let him get away.

80
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:57,709
Right.

81
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:11,376
-I'm going on ahead.

82
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,109
There's something I
need to check out.

83
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:14,976
You two stay on
his tail, got it?

84
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:15,876
-Got it.

85
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,543
-So it's all true, then.

86
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,543
-You are in this together.

87
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:34,143
-No, wait.

88
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:36,009
Please!

89
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,809
It's you two-- from
the other night.

90
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:44,943
NARUTO: I'm on to you,
and your so-called ghost!

91
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,043
-Who's back there?

92
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:48,776
-The jig is up, Kome.

93
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,176
The Curse Warrior is just
one of your flunkies.

94
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,909
Yeah, what do you think of that?

95
00:08:57,743 --> 00:09:00,209
-That night, I was
trying to find out

96
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:03,876
the true identity of
the Cursed Warrior, too.

97
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,709
I thought I-- that I might
know who it was, you see.

98
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:10,509
-So let's find out which.

99
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,409
We can solve this right now.

100
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:15,843
-Let it go.

101
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,943
-Kakashi-sensei.

102
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,909
Where were you?

103
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,909
-I'll explain later.

104
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,876
Go on ahead.

105
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,509
-What?

106
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:28,209
-Go on.

107
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,976
You're going with them.

108
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:30,609
-We are?

109
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:31,209
-Come on, Tenten.

110
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,543
Let's go.

111
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,976
-OK, I'm coming.

112
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,109
-All right.

113
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,876
You can stop following
me and show yourself.

114
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,276
Fine.

115
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:58,043
If that's the way
you want to play it.

116
00:09:58,076 --> 00:09:58,709
Summoning Jutsu!

117
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,243
-Hey, Kakashi.

118
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:03,243
What's up?

119
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:04,809
-I've got a hidden visitor.

120
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,543
Sniff him out, would you?

121
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:07,576
-Consider it done.

122
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,243
Hey.

123
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:15,743
You in there.

124
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:17,309
Hide and seek is over.

125
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,609
You can come out.

126
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:19,876
[laughter]

127
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,409
-Even I can't fool a dog's nose.

128
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:24,476
Very clever.

129
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:26,309
-So to what do I owe this honor?

130
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,743
-What is this secret tunnel for?

131
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:46,676
Where's it go?

132
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,343
Where's he leading us?

133
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,309
-They say the feudal
lord built passages

134
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,076
such as this all
over the last land

135
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,209
enable him to secretly
slip out of the palace

136
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:56,943
and observe the daily
lives of his people.

137
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,976
-Then if this cursed
warrior knows about,

138
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,376
he must have some connection
with the feudal lord.

139
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,143
Right?

140
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:03,676
-Well, we know one thing.

141
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,043
He's no more of a
ghost than I am.

142
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:09,076
-Whoever he is, I suspect
he'll reveal himself

143
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,309
when the time is right.

144
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:23,909
-I always thought
it was customary

145
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,676
for you ninja for hire to
go back to your own village

146
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,576
once your mission is complete.

147
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:29,776
-That's the idea.

148
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:33,443
But then, we're not so
sure this one is complete.

149
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,943
There's a few too many
suspicious loose ends.

150
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,543
-You stuck your
nose into something

151
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,943
that's none of your business.

152
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:43,543
If you'd only crawled on
home like a good little dog,

153
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,676
you would have
lived a lot longer.

154
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:46,709
-Hey, now.

155
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,609
There's no need to
get personal, here.

156
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:49,309
-Hm?

157
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:52,309
Gah!

158
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:55,309
-Whoa!

159
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:57,376
-Universal Assimilation Jutsu!

160
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,409
-I wasn't finished!

161
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,076
What happened to him?

162
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,309
-His body's taken on
the physical properties

163
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:07,509
of the rock.

164
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,109
-You've poked around into
our secrets long enough.

165
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,309
Now you pay!

166
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,943
-This guy's tougher than
he seemed at first bite.

167
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,809
-OK, Pakkun, take off.

168
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,709
I'll handle it from here.

169
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:19,843
-All righty, then.

170
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,976
Later.

171
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,476
-Assimilation, Rock Tank!

172
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,943
I'll crush you!

173
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:30,809
A shadow clone?

174
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,309
-Sorry.

175
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,076
Missed.

176
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:37,176
-Huh?

177
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,476
What are you-- a paper bomb!

178
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:09,009
-All right.

179
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:10,476
Don't you think
this is far enough?

180
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,309
-Huh?

181
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,476
-Yeah, you're probably right.

182
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:14,176
We should be in the clear.

183
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,143
-No-- no way!

184
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:28,552
Naruto?

185
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,124
-I thought as much.

186
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:36,824
-Then the Cursed Warrior-- it
wasn't Lord Sagi after all?

187
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:10,524
I-- I know who you are.

188
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,691
Lord Sagi.

189
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,358
It's you in there, isn't it?

190
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:29,191
When he made no answer, I
thought for sure I was right.

191
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:32,991
-You're probably all wondering
what I'm doing in this-- ow!

192
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,224
Tenten, what the
heck was that for?

193
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,658
-Let's just say I don't
like being kept in the dark.

194
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:40,324
And as for you, Neji, how long
have you known in was Naruto?

195
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,691
-I don't know.

196
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:42,391
For a while.

197
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,658
-Unbelievable!

198
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:47,424
I was really worried
about you, you know?

199
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,191
-Remember, we had two shinobi
on our tail at the time.

200
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:56,591
Careful.

201
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:57,324
Don't react.

202
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,058
-You're right.

203
00:14:58,091 --> 00:14:58,991
We're being followed.

204
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,158
-We're not going home.

205
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,124
We're going back to
the Land of Birds.

206
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,824
Follow my lead.

207
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:14,758
-Right.

208
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,958
-Understood, Sensei.

209
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,891
-But I thought we shook them
with that Substitution Jutsu.

210
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:22,991
-We shook off one of them.

211
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:31,291
But then, when we went in
pursuit of the Cursed Warrior,

212
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:33,858
a second shinobi
started following us.

213
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,758
-Wonderful.

214
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,024
So I'm the only one
who didn't know.

215
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:41,891
And I was actually worried.

216
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,991
-So it was you, young
man, and not Lord Sagi.

217
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,124
-That's right.

218
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,158
-I see.

219
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:50,224
Then-- then that means
Lord Sagi is safe.

220
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:50,824
-What's wrong?

221
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:51,724
Are you OK?

222
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,291
-I'm all right.

223
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,491
Just a bit weak.

224
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:56,724
You see, Moso was quite
persistent in squeezing

225
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:59,491
a confession out of me.

226
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:00,524
-Look at you.

227
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,258
Mister, you've been
beat up pretty good.

228
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,058
Why don't we
continue this inside?

229
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,858
We'll explain
everything, Sagi and me.

230
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:16,924
-Huh?

231
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,324
NAGARE: Assimilation,
Rock Shower!

232
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,391
We are nomadic shinobi.

233
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,691
With no home of our own, we
wander from village to village,

234
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:35,091
stealing jutsu and adapting
them for our own purposes.

235
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:39,458
Some jutsu you might
even recognize.

236
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:40,858
-Darn it.

237
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:41,658
What now?

238
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,224
Sharingan!

239
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:48,624
-Assimilation, Sand Coffin!

240
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,558
-That-- that's Gaara's jutsu!

241
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:59,191
-Assimilation, Sand Funeral!

242
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:00,158
Heh, heh, heh.

243
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,591
-Sagi, we've got company.

244
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:11,058
But first, what's the news
on our friend Chishima?

245
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,691
-Recovering well.

246
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,258
His life is not in danger.

247
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,691
He's sleeping now.

248
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:19,091
He's being looked after in
special quarters in the palace.

249
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,658
-Well, that's good news.

250
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,791
-Did something
happen to Chishima?

251
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:29,458
-Who was it?

252
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,458
Who did this to him?

253
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:34,491
-Kome, forgive me for
our misunderstanding.

254
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:37,991
-My lord, I'm the one
who seeks forgiveness.

255
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,358
-Chishima.

256
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,658
It was he who risked his life
to make me see the truth.

257
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,191
-I was there.

258
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,591
-Now that you know
everything you do,

259
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:53,724
we cannot let you survive.

260
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:56,824
You have trespassed on the
land of the feudal palace,

261
00:17:56,858 --> 00:18:00,624
and the punishment
for that is death!

262
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:02,991
-You're kidding me.

263
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,391
CHISHIMA: Lord Sagi--

264
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:06,091
-Chishima!

265
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:06,858
NARUTO: What happened?

266
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,491
Those are shuriken wounds.

267
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,424
-I'll summon a doctor at once.

268
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,424
-Lord Sagi, you must listen.

269
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,824
Your enemy-- the one who
betrayed you-- is Lord Moso!

270
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,658
-You're sure?

271
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:25,958
-Yes.

272
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:28,458
Moso's the one who murdered
Lord Owashi, your father,

273
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:29,658
and your sister, Lady Toki.

274
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:36,091
He had his assassins use these
shuriken of the palace guard

275
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:37,691
to commit the crime.

276
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:40,558
In order to implicate Lord Kome.

277
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:45,291
I suspect that Lord Kome had
somehow discovered Moso's plan.

278
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,224
-No!

279
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,258
Chishima!

280
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,091
-Lord Sagi, you must hurry.

281
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,958
You've got to call off
Lord Kome's execution.

282
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:54,591
-He's right.

283
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,291
There's no time to lose.

284
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:57,124
-No.

285
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:59,358
That is something I cannot do.

286
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:00,758
-What do you mean, you can't?

287
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,624
-It would mean
revealing to Lord Moso

288
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,624
that I know the truth about him.

289
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:06,291
I wouldn't get my revenge.

290
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,258
-You're saying you'd
sacrifice an innocent guy

291
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,358
for the sake of
your stupid revenge?

292
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:11,758
-I have no choice.

293
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,858
Besides, Lord Kome is guarded
by an army of soldiers.

294
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:16,458
We could never save
him by anything

295
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:18,524
less than starting a civil war.

296
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,124
-Not if I go alone.

297
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,491
I could save Lord
Kome by myself.

298
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:25,858
So, do you have any
problem with that?

299
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:26,358
-Lord Sagi--

300
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:30,858
-Do as you please.

301
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,491
-You guys know the rest of it.

302
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,824
I put on the ghost costume
and snatched him away.

303
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,558
-I played the part
of the Cursed Warrior

304
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,958
in hopes of discovering who
was behind the assassinations.

305
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:05,691
But I achieved
exactly the opposite.

306
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,791
Instead of finding
the real traitor,

307
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:14,891
understand, I was used by Moso
as a tool to implicate you.

308
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:18,858
-For my part, I was sure the
apparition I met in my room

309
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:23,691
was you, so I went to
the abandoned temple

310
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,791
where witnesses had seen
it coming and going.

311
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:32,224
At the temple, I encountered
the Cursed Warrior again.

312
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:35,691
-Yes, but that Cursed
Warrior was not me.

313
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:38,858
It was most likely something
of Moso's devising.

314
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:39,691
-Exactly.

315
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:41,091
Probably one of his henchmen.

316
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:43,958
It was all part of
the old man's trap.

317
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,724
-Moso.

318
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:47,424
It's clear that
his fiendish plan

319
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,558
was first to dispose
of me, and then

320
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:51,424
gain control of
the Land of Birds

321
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,058
by disposing of Lord Sagi.

322
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,958
-All the time
playing the good guy.

323
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,158
I can't wait to get
my hands on him!

324
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,358
-No, Naruto.

325
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,058
You've done well.

326
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:05,891
However, from this
point on, I act alone.

327
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:08,191
-But-- What do you mean?

328
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,124
-Understand.

329
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:11,191
I must settle this myself.

00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:21,358
Until I've done this, my heart
is as broken as this watch.

331
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:22,958
We are both stuck
forever in the past.

00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:03,907
-What do you mean
this is something

334
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,574
you've gotta settle yourself?

335
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:08,907
You think you won't get your
revenge unless you do it alone?

336
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,407
Even if you succeed,
what will you accomplish?

337
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,240
Revenge never solved anything.

338
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:16,540
It won't bring the
dead back to life.

339
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,640
It won't make you feel better.

340
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:21,007
You'll just end up being
as bad as your enemy.

341
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,674
Do you think your father and
sister will be proud of you

342
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,307
then?

343
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,107
Next time, When
Time Stands Still.
