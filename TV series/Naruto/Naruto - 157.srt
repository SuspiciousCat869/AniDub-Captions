RAIGA: Why?

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,957
Why do you go so far?

4
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,057
-I will become so
strong that Guy-sensei

5
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,624
can smile at me with pride.

6
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:26,390
Because that is my
way of the shinobi.

7
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:28,090
-I see.

8
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:29,657
That explains it.

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,690
Your whole life is devoted
to this sensei of yours.

10
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:37,224
Well, maybe this Guy
person can be the one

11
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,890
to hold your funeral!

12
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,524
What with all your hard
work and devotion I'm sure

Quit pushing me.

I can't run that fast.

19
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,057
This thing is too heavy.

We can look after Lee for now.

You just worry about getting the
curry to Neji and Naruto, dear.

OK?

-Mhm.

ahead and find Naruto.

No problem.

-Now then.

think you're doing?

-Does that mean you're awake?

-Wait.

00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,024
Hold on a minute?

What are you doing here?

I thought you fell off
the cliff, didn't you?

-It was just a trap, Naruto.

You couldn't figure that out?

It's the Curry of Life.

Try to eat some of it.

-Nothing to do about it now.

We have to get going.

-Do you think he's
going to be OK?

114
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,824
-Well, the truth is
we had bit of a mix

115
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,790
up with the ingredients.

116
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,057
But that's all right.

117
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,524
It should be just as
effective I believe.

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,557

He's headed over
in our direction.

125
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,224
-Don't worry, Sancho.

126
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:06,557
I'll go out and talk to him.

127
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:11,790
-Hm?

128
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,424
So you're still alive
after all, are you?

129
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,657
Well, this time I'll
do the job right!

130
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,157
-Raiga.

131
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:26,890
-Ranmaru.

132
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:27,857
I don't believe it.

133
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,257
You're alive.

134
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,424
-Why's Ranmaru here?

135
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,690
-It's complicated.

136
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:34,357
He offered his own
chakra to Raiga

137
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,057
and brought him back to life.

138
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,124
-What?

139
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,990
-But all of that effort
wiped Ranmaru out.

140
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:43,290
Raiga found him unconscious
and assumed he was dead.

141
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,257
-So that's what he
was raving about.

142
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,057
He kept talking about Ranmaru
looking down on him from above.

143
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,690
-There is a silver lining.

144
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:54,590
I got Ranmaru back to the
Curry of Life shop at least.

145
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:57,557
-Thanks for filling me in.

146
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,424
-Nothing will ever
separate us again, Ranmaru.

147
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,590
Now, let's off these brats and
get back to strewing mayhem

148
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,124
like we always have.

149
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:06,324
-Whatever you say, Raiga.

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,924
-Where did all
this fog come from?

151
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,790
-It's OK.

152
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:22,890
We're together again now.

153
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,357
I'll be your eyes.

154
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,857
-Yeah. that's right.

155
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,590
As long as I have
you at my side,

156
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,324
there's nothing for me to fear.

157
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,024
-Yes.

158
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,290
Let's leave now, Raiga.

159
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:36,257
-What about them?

160
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,257
-Don't worry.

161
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,590
They're all dead.

162
00:09:39,624 --> 00:09:41,424
-Enough said.

163
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,390
Time to seek out new prey then.

164
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:49,690
[gasp]

165
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:52,257
-They're heading right for that
steep cliff in front of them.

166
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,390
-I don't get it.

167
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:56,790
What the heck does
Ranmaru think he's doing?

168
00:09:56,824 --> 00:10:01,757
-He wouldn't-- Is he trying to
atone for his sins with Raiga?

169
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,924
I think he plans to lead
them both over the cliff

170
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:07,257
to their deaths!

171
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,224
-Are you kidding?

172
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,190
-What's your problem?

173
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,190
Jerk!

174
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,657
Huh?

175
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,657
-What was that?

176
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:27,090
RANMARU: Lee!

177
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,232
-Hey there.

178
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:42,898
How's it going?

179
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,932
Here I come!

180
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,365
-What is he doing?

181
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,298
You little brat.

182
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:18,465
You're pretty quick
to recover, huh?

183
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:21,965
-Eh-heh.

184
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:26,716
-Huh?

185
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,365
Quit playing with me!

186
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:38,365
What?

187
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,298
He's fast.

188
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:04,232
[scream]

189
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,198
-Ranmaru, are you relocate OK?

190
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:08,498
-Yeah.

191
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,698
-I need you to stay
put, all right?

192
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:11,332
-No!

193
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:11,898
Take me with you.

194
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:21,198
-Ranmaru!

195
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:22,598
Ranmaru, where are you?

196
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:33,398
You little-- You'll
pay for this!

197
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:40,132
Ninja Art Thunder Armor!

198
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:48,132
[slurred mumbling]

199
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:48,765
-Bring it on.

200
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:50,765
-I'll destroy you!

201
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:51,765
-Here I go.

202
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,265
[groan]

203
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:14,198
That was quite a blow.

204
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,698
If I hadn't donned
my Thunder Armor,

205
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,398
I'd be giving myself a funeral.

206
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:28,332
So that I always remember
how hard you fought here,

207
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,798
I'll take care of your funeral!

208
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:31,798
NARUTO: Not so fast!

209
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,665
-What do you think you're doing?

210
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,632
RANMARU: I've brought
you the Curry of Life.

211
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:49,632
I want you to try it.

212
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:50,998
RAIGA: What?

213
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:54,032
RANMARU: If you do, you'll
understand you're not alone.

214
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:58,298
It's spices blend together like
the feelings of all mankind.

215
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,798
RAIGA: What are you saying?

216
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,332
RANMARU: We've hurt too many.

217
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:01,898
Please.

218
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,298
We have to stop.

219
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:03,865
RAIGA: No!

220
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:06,232
That's enough!

221
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:08,898
You've always been
my eyes and ears.

222
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,698
If you don't stop spouting
this selfish nonsense,

223
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:14,932
we can no longer be as one.

224
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,398
-Strike me with
your lightning then.

225
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:21,398
If I die, the mighty
Raiga falls as well.

226
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,398
For we will always be as one.

227
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,732
-Ranmaru.

228
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:33,465
I won't be able to remember
you the way you were anymore.

229
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,965
I have to give you a funeral!

230
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:46,232
-Raiga, stop it!

231
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:47,432
Right now.

232
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,365
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

233
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:56,298
-Huh?

234
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,365
That is a lot of Narutos.

235
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:06,298
I-- I must have been out
of it for a little while.

236
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,165
-You little snot!

237
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,032
It doesn't make a difference
how many of you there are!

238
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,265
-Neji!

239
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,032
Wake up!

240
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,832
[groan]

241
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,232
-What are you doing, Neji?

242
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:25,965
Lets go.

243
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,198
Here.

244
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,632
Eat this and pull
yourself together.

245
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,098
We're in a lot of trouble.

246
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,065
-But that's--

247
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:42,865
Great.

248
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,965
Now you've done it.

249
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,398
-This kid risked his
life to say save you.

250
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:51,165
You'd really kill
him by your own hand?

251
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,832
-Ranmaru betrayed me.

252
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:56,965
He broke his promise to
stay at my side forever.

253
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,465
-That's because he doesn't
want to be by himself anymore.

254
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,865
Ranmaru has people
that care for him now.

255
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,565
He knows his life will
be better laughing

256
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:08,432
with the rest of the world,
instead of crying with you.

257
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:08,998
-Naruto.

258
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,232
-Look, Ranmaru.

259
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,798
You were planning
on ending your life

260
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,565
with this guys, weren't you?

261
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,265
You put that out of your head.

262
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,598
You're free now.

263
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:17,798
Trust me.

264
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:19,632
I'm not going to let Raiga
hold anymore funerals.

265
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:22,532
Not for you or for anybody!

266
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,932
-Hey.

267
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,832
I've heard just about
enough of your crap,

268
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,232
you little pipsqueak!

269
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,765
-What did you say?

270
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:32,698
-Don't underestimate me.

271
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,965
You stand before Raiga
Kurosuke of the Mist,

272
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:39,532
once counted as a member of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

273
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,632
I don't take orders
from the likes of you.

274
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:42,198
-Yeah.

275
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:42,898
That's right.

276
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,632
I almost totally forgot.

277
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,032
A long time ago, you were
one of the Seven Swordsmen.

278
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:51,065
You never did answer
my question before.

279
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,432
Kisame.

280
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:55,165
You know him, don't you?

281
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,498
RAIGA: Kisame.

282
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,232
I can't stand that lowlife.

283
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:03,198
Next time I see him he's
getting a funeral for sure.

284
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,132
NARUTO: What?

285
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,998
RAIGA: I despise him.

286
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,598
I hate all the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen!

287
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:15,565
Ranmaru, you're the only one
who's ever been a friend to me

288
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:17,065
in this life.

289
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:20,198
RAIGA: But you
don't need me now.

290
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:21,832
You've made other friends.

291
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:30,365
We'll never be two halves
of the same soul again.

292
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:30,865
-Raiga.

293
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,965
RAIGA: Impudent wretch!

294
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,598
Who was it that taught you
about the outside world

295
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,932
to begin with?

296
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,832
A funeral is is!

297
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:59,198
[groaning]

298
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,132
-Clone Spinning Axe Kick!

299
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:31,098
Shadow Clone Body Slam!

300
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:52,532
RAIGA (VOICEOVER): Ranmaru,
you're finally free now.

301
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,032
-Raiga.

302
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,032
-Come, lightning!

303
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,998
Give me a funeral
worth remembering!

304
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:36,465
RANMARU: Stir the
pot nice and hot.

305
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,332
Stir-- Ow.

306
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,132
-Come on Let me hear you.

307
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,198
You can't made the one
and only Curry of Life

308
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,998
unless you put your all into it.

309
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,865
Now stir it like you mean it.

310
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,432
-Is that so?

311
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:49,532
-Mom!

312
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,632
What the heck did
you do that for?

313
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:52,932
-Don't you mom me!

314
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,865
It's about a hundred
years to soon

315
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:57,365
for you to be preaching
about the family curry.

316
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,798
You and this child
are on equal ground!

317
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,432
You're starting your training
over from the beginning!

318
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:04,798
-Come on!

319
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:05,665
-Grandma Sancho?

320
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,132
-Huh?

321
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,865
-It is time for us
to get going now.

322
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:10,832
-Thanks for your help.

323
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:11,932
-Yeah.

324
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,798
I know you'll take
food care of Ranmaru.

325
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,398
-He's in good hands.

326
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,465
His training will be merciless,
but before you know it,

327
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:21,332
he'll be cooking
the Curry of Life.

328
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:25,298
-Ranmaru, Karashi,
best of luck to you.

329
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,265
-Thanks.

330
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:28,665
-Hold on a sec.

331
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,698
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is more than just a hop, skip,

332
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,365
and a jump away, you know.

333
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,198
I've whipped up a
special batch that'll

334
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,465
give you 10,000 times
the strength you'll

335
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,598
need for the journey.

336
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:40,998
