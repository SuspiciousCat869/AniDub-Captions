00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,300
[theme song]

2
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:14,702
KIBA (VOICEOVER): His scent.

3
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,508
He's moving away.

4
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:21,068
-That was close.

5
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:21,868
-What was?

6
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:36,368
-Please wait.

7
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:39,635
From now on, we play for keeps.

8
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,435
ROCK (VOICEOVER): My
role now is to stall

9
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:47,535
this person as long as possible.

10
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,702
I would rather not resort
to more powerful attacks.

11
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,702
It will only leave me
vulnerable to defeat.

12
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,935
But my enemy is
a formidable one.

13
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,802
I will have to reveal my
secret technique to best him.

14
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,568
-Here I come.

15
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,068
ROCK (VOICEOVER): I just had
surgery, so I'm not at my best.

16
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:10,435
But if I only open the first
gate-- the gate of opening--

17
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:11,902
I should be all right.

18
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:18,802
-The first gate,
Gate of Opening!

19
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:19,335
Open!

20
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:24,735
Primary lotus!

21
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:35,002
ROCK (VOICEOVER): The bone
absorbed the impact of my kick.

22
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:37,435
-Your speed is impressive.

23
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,202
But this is over now.

24
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,468
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Come on.

25
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,402
I'm wracking my brain, here.

26
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,802
Why can't I come
up with anything?

27
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,268
I'm at the end of my rope.

28
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:49,235
I can't hold on any longer.

29
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:54,002
-You're staring
death in the face.

30
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,735
Shouldn't you be screaming
for mercy or something?

31
00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,202
Huh?

32
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:02,102
-Now die!

33
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,035
-You're mine!

34
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,368
-You're gonna die, kid.

35
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:06,802
Wipe that grin off your face!

36
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:17,468
-What the hell?

37
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:26,702
-Who are you?

38
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:34,968
-What do you know?

39
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,235
Looks like we're
allies this time.

40
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,935
-Who are you?

41
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,068
-Allies of the Leaf Village.

42
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,835
-We're shinobi--

43
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:52,835
-Of the sand.

44
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:01,835
NARUTO: The sand shinobi,
allies of the leaf!

45
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,902
ROCK (VOICEOVER): Sand ninja?

46
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,468
Am I still drunk, or something?

47
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,035
-He is Gaara, of the sand.

48
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:44,868
-Gaara.

49
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:53,402
Is that what they call you?

50
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:54,368
Digital shrapnel!

51
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:21,568
ROCK (VOICEOVER): He fired
the bones from his fingertips?

52
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:25,902
-Impulsive, aren't you?

53
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,102
You're different.

54
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,202
When you fought against me
you had much more agility

55
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:46,935
and sharpness.

56
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:55,902
-I figured you would say that.

57
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,768
I am not the kind of
person who holds a grudge.

58
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:04,068
Even so-- because of you I've
had a fairly tough time of it.

59
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:07,568
-Really?

60
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,235
-Anyway, why have you come here?

61
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:21,435
-I owe the leaf.

62
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:26,302
I owe the leaf a great debt.

63
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:26,802
-Sasuke!

64
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:37,002
-I had heard something about
how our village had finally

65
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,802
made up with you traitors.

66
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:42,202
But I didn't expect you to
change sides so quickly.

67
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:45,002
-It's not like we just attacked
the Leaf Village for kicks,

68
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:45,868
you know.

69
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:49,135
We were following orders.

70
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,102
That's all.

71
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,735
Just like we're doing
on this mission.

72
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:55,202
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): I get it.

73
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,568
The Fifth Hokage sent them.

74
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,035
She saved our butts.

75
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,602
-By the way, you
seem a lot dumber

76
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:04,535
than the last time
our paths crossed.

77
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,035
-Huh?

78
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:13,568
-So, are you gonna give
up again this time?

79
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:14,435
Go ahead.

80
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:16,135
I'll take care of this for you.

81
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:17,735
-Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

82
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:19,268
but I'm not about to give up.

83
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:21,002
And besides, a real
man doesn't let

84
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:23,435
a woman do his fighting for him.

85
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:24,635
-Ha.

86
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,402
Still being all macho with
the man and woman stuff?

87
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:29,668
You talk tough, but I
know it's just an act.

88
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:30,168
Idiot.

89
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:42,735
-So this time you're on
the leaf's side, huh?

90
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:46,435
You guys are all over
the place, aren't you?

91
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,068
-The sound of the flute
summons her genjutus.

92
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:49,568
-I got it.

93
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,068
Cyclone scythe jutsu!

94
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,868
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
She's deflecting

95
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,868
the sound of the flute
and nailing our opponent

96
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,835
with a physical attack.

97
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,802
She can attack and
defend at the same time.

98
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,802
That's a pretty
handy jutsu to have.

99
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:40,635
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): It's like
that girl was born to fight me.

100
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:58,335
-Well, I don't see him.

101
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,435
I guess Ukon must have
taken him out already.

102
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:13,668
-So, you fight with puppets?

103
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:18,168
-Hey, wait a second.

104
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,002
When you showed up here, weren't
you in a group of three people?

105
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:23,635
-The other two went on
ahead, because you guys

106
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:25,368
couldn't hack it.

107
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:26,568
-Listen, moron.

108
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:28,302
These enemies aren't
exactly lightweights.

109
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:32,535
Behind you!

110
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,002
It's no use.

111
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:43,468
I can't move.

112
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:44,435
-What is this guy?

113
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:49,368
-He's all yours, Sakon.

114
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:50,302
Finish him!

115
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,335
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
Where'd other one go?

116
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:59,735
-Boo.

117
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,702
Looking for someone, kid?

118
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,235
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
That body position.

119
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:05,835
I've seen it.

120
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,202
-Be careful.

121
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:10,468
He's about to try and enter
your body and combine with it!

122
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,502
-It's too late.

123
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,035
I can't believe it!

124
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,468
-What's the matter, Sakon?

125
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:54,435
-I guess that jutsu of yours
doesn't really work on puppets,

126
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,202
dos it?

127
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:58,035
SAKON (VOICEOVER): This
one's a puppet, too?

128
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:03,735
-Fair warning.

129
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:08,368
We sand ninja aren't pushovers
like our friends from the leaf.

130
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:11,902
Oh, and standing as close as
you are to my friend, the Black

131
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:17,968
Ant-- big mistake.

132
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,902
[scream]

133
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:24,335
KIBA (VOICEOVER):
I hated going up

134
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,202
against the sand
ninja as enemies,

135
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:28,802
but as allies they're
pretty amazing.

136
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:08,098
-What?

137
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:12,798
That hurt.

138
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,898
You take over, brother.

139
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,065
Let me rest in this
body a little bit first.

140
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:18,498
-You're so pathetic, Sakon.

141
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,565
-Just who are these freaks?

142
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:24,231
-This is their most
dangerous ability.

143
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:27,198
-I can't believe you let that
puppet catch you off guard.

144
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:31,231
Well, you can be sure I won't.

145
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:34,798
Its puny power and speed
are nothing special.

146
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:37,298
It'll take more than
this toy to stop me.

147
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:49,698
I healed my stomach wound.

148
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:52,065
I don't have much chakra left.

149
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,298
But it should be more
than enough to vanquish

150
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,998
these scrawny amateurs.

151
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:59,331
KIBA (VOICEOVER): His wounds
are already back to normal.

152
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,131
That healing ability
is unbelievable.

153
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:08,731
-I'm not usually the one who
turns into the main body.

154
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,198
It's hard to move like this.

155
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:14,331
-It's like they're over
there just mocking us.

156
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,831
-This isn't the kind of enemy
you can beat head-to-head.

157
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,298
Back down and we'll regroup!

158
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:23,698
-I can't back down when
they show me no respect.

159
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,065
-Not quite.

160
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,831
[scream]

161
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,998
-My Black Ant puppet isn't
designed to be used on offense.

162
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:08,165
Its usual function
is trapping people.

163
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,465
But when the Black And
is paired with the Crow,

164
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:13,031
it makes a deadly
attack combination.

165
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:13,998
-Hey, you punk!

166
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,498
Let me out of here!

167
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,931
Can you hear me?

168
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:18,431
Ahhh!

169
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:46,165
-And now let's
have a puppet show.

170
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:48,031
-Hey, let me out!

171
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:50,731
Let m out, or I'll kill you!

172
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,765
-Secret black move.

173
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:53,765
Iron maiden!

174
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,731
[scream]

175
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,031
Show's over.

176
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:34,898
-She must be hiding around here.

177
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,798
-Or she gave up.

178
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,865
-Not her.

179
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,231
She'd never run away.

180
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,831
-Since I'm new to
this fight, maybe it'd

181
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:47,965
be a good idea for you to
explain the situation to me.

182
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:50,731
Give me an analysis of her
skills and battle style.

183
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:54,431
-Well, first off, her
flute casts genjutsu.

184
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:57,131
She uses it to
ensnare her opponents.

185
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:01,931
And when they can't move she
delivers a lethal attack.

186
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:02,898
-Demon flute.

187
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,698
Chains of fantasia.

188
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,065
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
This is bad.

189
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,965
Is this a genjutsu?

190
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,865
My body-- I can't move.

191
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:28,031
-So you said this was your
final move, didn't you?

192
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:31,265
Unfortunately, it's checkmate.

193
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:33,531
Die, little rat!

194
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:37,165
-She's a typical long-range
genjutsu-style shinobi.

195
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:39,431
Most likely as soon
as she saw your jutsu

196
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:41,631
she realized it could
counteract her own.

197
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,931
That's why she retreated.

198
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,298
Besides, it's two
against one now.

199
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,865
I doubt she'll
show herself again

200
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,931
until she's able to
cast her genjutsu.

201
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,031
-So it's sound.

202
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:53,731
-That's right.

203
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:59,965
Genjutsu's work by affecting
one of the five senses.

204
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,331
Sight, hearing, smell,
taste, and touch.

205
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,798
Among them the ones that involve
hearing are the most dangerous

206
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,831
of them all.

207
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,031
Not only does it allow
her to stay out of view

208
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:19,131
and keep a safe
distance away from us,

209
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,065
but we'll have no idea when
or where the genjutsu will

210
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:23,798
be coming from.

211
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:27,265
The idea is for us to be already
under the spell of her flute

212
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,431
by the time we figure
out where she is.

213
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:38,565
Ngh-- if you really want
my honest assessment,

214
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:41,098
we are at an overwhelming
disadvantage here.

215
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,731
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
We shouldn't even

216
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,965
talk about facing
this kind of enemy

217
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:49,398
without close-range
ninja like Kiba or Neji.

218
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,731
-Listen, sooner or later she's
going to get us cornered,

219
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,065
and that'll be that.

220
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,598
I think we should
withdraw until we--

221
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:57,631
-Excuse me, did I
ask for your opinion?

222
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:58,731
-What?

223
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:00,631
-I told you to explain
the situation to me.

224
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:03,165
That's all.

225
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:08,331
You have no idea what
kind of powers I have.

226
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:11,098
If she thinks she
can hide from me

227
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,298
but stay close enough so
the sound of her flute

228
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:19,131
can still reach
me, she's mistaken.

229
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:20,965
All right.

230
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,465
Summoning blade dance!

231
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:36,865
TAYUYA (VOICEOVER): All right.

232
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,765
I'm far enough away.

233
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,398
It's time for my genjutsu.

234
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:41,898
Huh?

235
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:49,798
[scream]

236
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,398
-How was that?

237
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:36,198
It's finished.

238
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:38,365
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): She
doesn't mess around, huh?

239
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:40,631
She's as subtle as a rhino.

240
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:44,031
She might even be
scarier than my mom.

241
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:47,365
-Pretty good, huh?

242
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:50,331
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Oh, well.

243
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:53,131
This time I guess I should
be grateful she's so scary.

244
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,800
[music playing]

245
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,442
-I was careless before, but it
will not be like that anymore.

246
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:08,442
Now, if you would
please stand back.

247
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:13,009
I am thankful for your help, but
I will be the one to fight him.

248
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,142
This time with my
ultimate lotus!

249
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:18,209
Excuse me, but why are
you moving forward?

250
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:20,975
I already told you,
I am his opponent!

251
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,209
Come on!

252
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:24,409
NARUTO: Next time-- showdown!

253
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:26,542
Gaara versus Kimimaro!
