-All right, heads
up, you maggots!

00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:52,322
The second part of
the test has begun!

5
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,729
-You know who we're looking for.

6
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:58,364
-Yeah.

7
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:01,168
Those three brats.

8
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,102
-Well all right!

9
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,005
Here we go guys!

10
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,053
-OK.

11
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:16,856
First thing we got
to do is to find it.

12
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,924
Are you ready, Hinata?

13
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:20,828
-Um hm.

14
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:22,030
-Take it easy, Lee.

15
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:24,700
The test's only just begun.

00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,035
-That may be.

17
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,874
But still-- whoever
our enemies are,

18
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,344
I want to find them
before they find us.

19
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,280
-We have only one target.

20
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,016
Stay focused on it.

someone screaming.

00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,078
I do not like this place.

00:02:58,347 --> 00:02:59,649
There's nothing to be scared of!

28

It's gonna be a piece of cake!

But excuse me a second.

I really gotta, you know.

-Are you kidding me?!

32
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,262
Get out of here!

33
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:09,963
What is this?!

34
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:10,997
A kennel?!

35
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:11,966
Not in front of me you don't!

36
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,502
Find a bush or something!

Ah.

Ah, yeah.

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,862
Man, that was a lot.

43
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,564
I wrote my whole name.

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,968
-You are such a pig!

45
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,906
You're really disgusting
sometimes, you know that?

46
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,275
-Ah.

-Hey, it wasn't that bad.

50
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:53,957
Don't you think that was
going a little overboard?

51
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,395
-Yeah, what the heck
was that all about?

52
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,131
-OK, where's the real Naruto?

53
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,367
-Huh?

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,602
-Better watch out, Sakura.

55
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:04,138
I think he's gone crazy.

56
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,273
-Yeah right.

57
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:06,507
Then what happened
to that scratch

58
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,876
you got from the examiner?

59
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,546
-Huh?

60
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,448
-And I noticed you've
got your shuriken

61
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:13,417
holster on your left side.

62
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,552
Naruto's right-handed.

63
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:20,527
Your transformation skill
is worse than Naruto's.

64
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,129
Tell me who you are.

65
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,265
-So you got me.

66
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:26,769
I'm still gonna
take your scroll.

67
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:29,573
-So which one of you has it?

68
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:33,912
Or do I take you both out?

69
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:34,613
-Fire style!

70
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:36,115
Phoenix flower jutsu!

71
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:45,495
-(ANGRILY) Hey get me out of it!

72
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,298
-Little idiot.

73
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,566
-Thank you.

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,102
-Better get your
mind on the game.

75
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,308
A paper bomb.?

00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,518
-Sorry.

78
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,386
This is one test you fail.

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,557
Now hand over the
scroll, or you die.

80
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:07,759

-[grunt] Oh no you don't!

83
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:17,506
SASUKE: (VOICEOVER) Well, well.

84
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,045
Better late than never, I guess.

85
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:24,983
Focus my chakra.

86
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:25,984
[grunt]

87
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:26,585
-Huh?

88
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,137
-Are you all right?

89
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,773
-Don't just stand there, Sakura.

90
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:44,543
Chances are, this
guy's not alone.

91
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,745
Watch out!

92
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,417
The others could
strike any second now!

93
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,719
-I wish.

94
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:53,556
I came alone so as not
to arouse suspicion.

95
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,724
Big mistake.

96
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,202
SASUKE: (VOICEOVER)
So much for him.

97
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:02,969
For now.

98
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:11,414
-That proves that we can't
just trust appearances.

99
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,951
We have to come up with a way
of knowing that each of us

100
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:17,222
is who we say we are, and
not some impostor using

101
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,991
a Transformation Jutsu.

102
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,192
-Mm hm.

103
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:22,530
-All right, so what do we do?

104
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:25,534
-We need a password.

105
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,436
-What kind of password?

106
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,838
-A secret one.

107
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,007
Something known only
to the three of us.

108
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,645
And don't trust anyone
who doesn't know it.

109
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,215
No matter what.

110
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,020
OK, listen closely, because
I only want to say this once.

111
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:43,525
The question will be,
when does a ninja strike?

112
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:48,365
And the response is, a ninja
waits until the time is right,

113
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,437
when the enemy sleeps and drops
his guard, when his weapons lie

114
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:54,774
forgotten in the
stillness of the night.

115
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:58,412
That is the moment
for a ninja to strike.

116
00:06:58,445 --> 00:06:59,647
Got it?

117
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:02,451
-I got it.

118
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:05,122
-You got one a little shorter?

119
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:05,790
-(FRUSTRATED GROWL)

120
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:06,624
SASUKE: No, Naruto.

121
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,093
That's it.

122
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,361
SAKURA: Aw, come on!

123
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,562
What's wrong?

124
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,397
Didn't you get it?

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,333
I memorized It easy.

126
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,201
NARUTO: Yeah sure.

127
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,002
I got it.

128
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:15,536
I got it.

129
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,171
No problem.

130
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,442
I just thought it was
going to be a password, not

131
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:22,713
a pass speech.

132
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,283
SASUKE: All right then,
I'll take the scroll.

133
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,885
-Wait a minute, Sasuke.

134
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,787
I-- ah!

135
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,594
What was that?

136
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:39,002
-[wind screaming] [blast]

-What is it now?

[blast]

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,756
-All right.

141
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,660
You two fan out into the
woods, and keep your eyes open.

142
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,295
(Evilly) I'll handle this alone.

143
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:12,949
-Sakura.

144
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:13,784
-Sasuke!

145
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,052
What was that?

146
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,053
-Stay there!

147
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,290
First answer the question.

148
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,058
When does a ninja strike?

149
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,695
-Oh, mm.

150
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,364
A ninja waits until
the time is right.

151
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:27,703
When the enemy sleeps and drops
his guard, when his weapons lie

152
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,307
forgotten in the
stillness of the night,

153
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,311
that is the moment
for a ninja to strike.

154
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:34,445
-Good.

155
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,281
NARUTO: [gasp] Hey!

156
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,282
What's up?

157
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,150
You guys OK?

158
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,585
SAKURA: -Don't come any closer.

159
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,587
NARUTO: Huh?

160
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,722
SAKURA: What's the password?

161
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,858
-Oh sure, no problem.

162
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,695
OK, a ninja waits until
the time is right.

163
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:50,334
When the enemy sleeps and drops
his guard, when his weapons lie

164
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,938
forgotten in the
stillness of the night,

165
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:56,376
that is the moment
for a ninja to strike.

166
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,377
-[sigh]

167
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,746
-Hm.

168
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,380
-Aaahh.

169
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,414
-Huh?

170
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:02,351
Aaahh! [groan] What was that!

171
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,153
You could've killed me!

172
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:07,124
-Gotta hand it to you, you're
quicker than the last one.

173
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:08,459
-What are you talking about?

174
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:09,794
What was wrong with that?

175
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:12,731
He just got the password
right, word for word.

176
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,600
-Exactly.

177
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,801
That's what's wrong.

178
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,435
-Huh?

179
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,137
-Huh?

180
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,975
-You really think Naruto
could memorize all that?

181
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:23,180
And get it word for word?

182
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,250
Not the Naruto I know,
not in a million years.

183
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:30,390
You'd have a better chance
teaching it to a hamster.

184
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:31,024
-Oh right.

185
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,594
You've got a point.

186
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:35,129
-Besides, you saw
the way this guy

187
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:37,232
moved when he dodged my attack.

188
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:40,904
That was definitely
not a Naruto move.

189
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:43,574
All right, come on
out, whoever you are.

190
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:46,412
Party's over.

191
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:47,379
-Hm hm!

192
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:52,320
Aren't we the clever one?

193
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:01,065
Tell me, if your
teammate is really

194
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:05,171
that dimwitted, why
would you come up

195
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,142
with a password he'd
never be able to remember?

196
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,078
-You see, it wasn't
meant for Naruto,

197
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,148
so much as for anybody
who might happen

198
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,985
to be nearby, trying
to eavesdrop on us.

199
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:16,086
It was meant as a trap.

200
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,356
And you stumbled right into it.

201
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,428
-I'm impressed.

202
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:26,067
You certainly haven't
dropped your guard, have you?

203
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,336
This promises to be
very entertaining.

204
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:37,383
SAKURA: (VOICEOVER) She gives
new meaning to the word creepy.

205
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,450
Where is Naruto?

206
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:48,731
-[groan] OK, upsy daisy.

207
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:52,937
Huh?

208
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,040
Hey, where did
Sasuke and Sakura go?

209
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:57,343
I wonder if they-- huh?

210
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:59,313
Whoa!

211
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:00,448
Oh my gosh!

212
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:06,589
That's, that's, that's
that is one big snake!

213
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,573
[aaghh!] Huh oh!

214
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:22,545
[groan] I can't move.

215
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:25,549
[aaghh!]

216
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:35,930
-[gasp]

217
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:38,333
-Ah!

218
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,038
You'd love to get your hands on
our earth scroll, wouldn't you?

219
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:45,176
It would go so nicely
with your heaven scroll.

220
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:59,997
-[gasp]

221
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:05,705
-Well, when this is
all over, one of us

222
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,674
will have both scrolls.

223
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,643
-[gasp]

224
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:12,114
-And the other will be dead.

225
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:17,454
-[gasp]

226
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:24,831
-[gasp]

227
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:28,402
-[screams]

228
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:40,153
-[gasp]

229
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:42,956
SASUKE: (VOICEOVER)
Is this an illusion?

230
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:54,673
[vomiting] No, it's
more than that.

231
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:58,544
Her thirst for blood
is almost palpable.

232
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:03,485
Looking in her eyes, I saw
the moment of my own death.

233
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:10,027
Who is she?

234
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,462
What is she?

235
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,236
Sa-- Sakura?

236
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:27,318
No use.

237
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:29,321
She's got it worse than me.

238
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:32,225
We've got to get out of here.

239
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,359
Get away from her.

240
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:39,167
She's death.

241
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,739
NARUTO: Let me out of here!

242
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,743
I'll make you sorry
you ever swallowed me,

243
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:48,647
you stinking jerk!

244
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,951
Let me out!

245
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,486
Hey, wait a second.

246
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,127
Here, [groan] wouldn't
you rather have this?

247
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,430
I was saving this
rice ball for lunch.

248
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,781
It's all gone!

249
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:17,287
And I'll be digested just
like that in another minute.

250
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,891
[screams] No!

251
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,859
Let me out!

252
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:22,861
Sakura!

253
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:23,729
Sasuke!

254
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,928
Get me out of here!

255
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:34,711
--[evil laughter] You're
paralyzed with fear.

256
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:38,750
SASUKE: [groan] (VOICEOVER)
What's wrong with me?

257
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,085
Move.

258
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:44,057
Come on, move Sasuke, move.

259
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,126
That's it.

260
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,030
You can do this.

261
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:55,373
Yes. [groan] That's right.

262
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,348
Even if it's just a little.

263
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:04,252
You've got to move.

264
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:07,156
-Very good.

265
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,923
Now what happens?

266
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,829
SASUKE: (VOICEOVER) It's no use.

267
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:15,534
[groan] I can't move.

268
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,171
-Don't worry, I'll
make it quick.

269
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:21,742
But I don't have to
tell you that, do I?

270
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,679
You've seen it
with your own eyes.

271
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:42,471
(EVIL LAUGHTER) I expected
you to be more of a challenge.

272
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:43,472
How disappointing.

273
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,629
NARUTO: (VOICEOVER)
I can't believe it.

274
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,431
Is this really how it ends?

275
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,991
Iruka Sensei.

276
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:10,877
Old man Hokage.

277
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:15,451
Konohamaru.

278
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:20,791
Kakashi Sensei.

279
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,132
Oh, Sakura.

280
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:35,078
Well, some people I'll
miss more than others.

281
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,346
Hm.

282
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,815
I don't know what
Sasuke's problem was.

283
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:40,351
The guy was always
jealous of me.

284
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:42,822
Still, we had our moments.

285
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:44,491
Like the time we
helped Kakashi Sensei

286
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:48,029
bring down that creep, Zabuza.

287
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:50,800
In a way, we were probably
good for each other,

288
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,605
always competing, pushing
each other in every challenge,

289
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,874
always looking for
that final showdown,

290
00:16:56,908 --> 00:17:00,146
to prove which
one of us is best.

291
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,147
Hey!

292
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,382
Wait a minute, that's right!

293
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,351
We never did have
our final showdown.

294
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,487
We never proved who's best.

295
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,290
(Both Naruto and Sasuke)
I want some more!

296
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:15,166
NARUTO: (VOICEOVER) No way.

297
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,437
Can't just leave things
up in the air like that.

298
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,204
That's it.

299
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,439
I'm out of here.

300
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,542
Whether Slitherpuss
likes it, or not.

301
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,631
-So that's how it is.

302
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:58,760
-[gasp]

303
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:02,732
-Oh, Sasuke. [gasp]

304
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,968
VILLAINESS: (VOICEOVER)
A desperate move.

305
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,337
But a clever one.

306
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,143
Sasuke: (VOICEOVER) Move Sasuke.

307
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,379
You've got to move.

308
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:13,480
Move!

309
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,081
Move!

310
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,926
Move!

311
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:32,273
[aagghh]

312
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:36,112
VILLAINESS: (VOICEOVER) He
overcame the fear with pain.

313
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,213
So.

314
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:40,184
This prey is not so
helpless after all.

315
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,321
NARUTO: (VOICEOVER)
Shadow clone jutsu!

316
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:55,739
Sorry, but you picked
the wrong shinobi.

317
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,042
I'm going to be Hokage one day.

318
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:00,579
If you think I'm going to
end up a pile of snake crap

319
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:04,285
in the woods, you're crazy!

320
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:07,489
-[grunt]

321
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:13,798
-[gasp] That wound's deep.

322
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:16,768
Will you be all right?

323
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,637
Sasuke: (VOICEOVER) Gotta move.

324
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,508
Gotta get away from her.

325
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,144
But how?

326
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,347
Where?

327
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,185
SAKURA: (VOICEOVER) Man, I've
never seen Sasuke like this.

328
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,253
He's got me scared.

329
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:39,834
[gasp] Sasuke, watch out!

330
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:45,908
-Unbelievable.

331
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:47,344
I didn't even notice.

332
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:48,245
I'm losing it!

333
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,062
[groan] No!

334
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:01,404
Stay away!

335
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:23,094
[gasp]

00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:26,865
-[gasp]

337
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,068
VILLAINESS: I sense your
fear and desperation.

338
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,741
It's only natural.

339
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,578
The prey must never
let down it's guard,

340
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:41,886
not even for a moment, in the
presence of it's predator.

341
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:52,234
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:55,204

343
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:58,576
-[aagghh!]

344
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,378
-[gasp]

345
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:02,882
NARUTO: Looks like
I came just in time.

346
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:10,960
-Naruto!

347
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:18,336
-Oh, and by the way, what
was that password again?

348
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:25,280
[singing Japanese]

349
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,304
-How do you like that?

350
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:58,241
I turn my back for one
minute, and Slitherlips

351
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,813
has got my teammates so
freaked, they can hardly move.

352
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,616
Well, I'm not afraid of snakes.

353
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,486
And I just spent the
last hour inside of one.

354
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,621
These guys.

355
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:09,825
Sometimes I wonder what
they'd do without me.

356
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:11,260
Hey, never fear.

357
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:13,029
The reptile crew is here.

358
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:15,860
Next time, Naruto's
counter-attack.

359
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:17,260
Never give in!

360
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,260
I don't care who this creep is.

361
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,493
Nobody sticks their
tongue out at me.
