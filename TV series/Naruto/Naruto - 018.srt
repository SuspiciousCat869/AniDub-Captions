[panting]

00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:55,638
-Naruto and the others
are fighting and risking

3
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:59,308
their lives, while the
rest of us do nothing.

4
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:03,647
We've got to fight, too.

5
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,916
The weapon's known as shinobi.

6
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,820
[knocking]

7
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,790
-Uncle Giichi,
Uncle Giichi, hurry.

8
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:15,726
Come to the bridge with me.

9
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,929
We don't have to
hide any longer.

10
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,599
If we all fight together, we
can finally take Gato down.

11
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:21,667
I know we can.

12
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,673
[click]

13
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:30,210
-No, Inari, I've
given up fighting.

14
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:34,314
Fighting is for heroes,
like your father.

15
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,417
You see what good it did him.

16
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,121
Isn't one dead hero enough?

17
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:40,721
-Uh--

18
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,496
-What will more
fighting bring us

19
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:51,433
but more fallen heroes
and more regrets?

20
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:56,639
No, Inari, my heart is
already full of enough regrets

21
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:57,473
to last a lifetime.

22
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:14,859
-Well, I don't want to live
a life of regrets, either.

23
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:18,163
And that's why
we've got to fight!

24
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:20,966
-Live your life so you
have nothing to regret.

25
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,072
-I know you care about
everyone in the village,

26
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,809
and so do I-- you and mother
and grandfather and everyone.

27
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,778
That's why we have to fight.

28
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,721
All my life, I've been
a coward, but now I

29
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:42,823
know that crying, and hiding
from things that we're

30
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,994
afraid of doesn't
make them go away.

31
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,281
-Hurry!

32
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,717
Come to the bridge!

33
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,286
-Our little Inari
has become a man.

34
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,725
And you, dear, are
you sure you want

35
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,494
to send him off all on his own?

36
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:25,471
-Is anyone there?

37
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,241
[knocking] Hello!

38
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,044
Come to the bridge
with me and fight!

39
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,783
[panting]

40
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,986
-What do I do now?

41
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,189
Not one of them will even
open their door to listen.

42
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,404
Uh--

43
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:50,799
-Cuz, you really are brave.

44
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,637
Well, then, if no
one will help--

45
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:04,181
[panting]

46
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:12,357
[roaring]

47
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,994
-Poor Zabuza, see where
your ambitions got you?

48
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:19,365
You're always pushing
things too far.

49
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:22,568
It was the failed
Mizukage assassination,

50
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,403
and your attempted coup d'etat.

51
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:27,874
You were forced to flee with
the few followers you had,

52
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,011
your country's tracker
ninja hot on your heels.

53
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,882
You became a rogue ninja
whose name was quickly known,

54
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:37,551
even in the village
hidden in the leaves.

55
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:41,790
Now you're crazy enough to want
to go back and try it again,

56
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:43,825
but for that you need money.

57
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,360
And to get it,
you've stooped so low

58
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:50,199
as to be the hired thug
of a swine like Gato.

59
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:52,702
All right, Zabuza enough talk.

60
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,337
Time to finish it.

61
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,906
But it won't be with
Sharingan imitations

62
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,375
of some other ninja's tricks.

63
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,947
No-- it's time I introduced
you to my own Jutsu.

64
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:16,729
[crackling]

65
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:19,698
-Lightning blaze!

66
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:22,735
-His chakra's so
strong, it's visible!

67
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,403
He holds it in his hands.

68
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:30,377
-I won't allow you
to kill Tazuna.

69
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,213
He's a brave man
with a noble dream.

70
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,082
The bridge he's
building is the hope

71
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:38,152
of this land, and
all its people.

72
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:39,587
You're like a disease.

73
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,925
By attacking one, you infect
all, and you don't care.

74
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,696
That is not the
way of the shinobi.

75
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:48,797
-You're right.

76
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,367
I don't care.

77
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,203
These useless little people
and their petty, little dreams.

78
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:58,141
Why should they matter to me?

79
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,677
I have a dream of my own!

80
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,079
[crackling]

81
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:06,850
-But to have a dream, you
need to have a future.

82
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,019
You don't.

83
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,058
Your future's all
used up, Sabuza.

84
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,437
-Go on.

85
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,638
Finish it.

86
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,808
Kill me.

87
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:30,010
[grunting]

88
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:32,313
Why do you hesitate?

89
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:36,283
- [panting]

90
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:40,555
I thought you wanted
to be a mighty warrior.

91
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:42,324
[grunting]

92
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,126
-That's not what it's about.

93
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,361
Do you really believe that's
all there is to it, just

94
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:47,663
fighting and killing
until there's

95
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,097
only one man left standing?

96
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:54,570
There's a lot more to
being shinobi than that,

97
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:56,806
and there are other ways
of showing your strength

98
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,043
than just by beating
someone in battle.

99
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:03,513
-I had a feeling all along,
from the first moment

100
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:05,082
we met in the woods.

101
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:06,584
We are a lot alike.

102
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:09,187
-Huh?

103
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,490
-I'm sure you know what I mean.

104
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:15,126
I'm only sorry that it
must be your hand that

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,464
is tainted with
my unworthy blood.

106
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,632
-Sure about this?

107
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,971
And you're positive
that it's the only way?

108
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
-Yes.

109
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,742
[grunting]

110
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,445
-The weird thing is, if we
met in another time and place,

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,782
I think that maybe we
could have been friends.

112
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,725
-Yes, that's right.

113
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:46,395
Hold fast to your dreams.

114
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:50,500
-This is for Sasuke,
because he also had a dream.

115
00:08:56,406 --> 00:09:00,611
[yelling]

116
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,579
-Thank you, Naruto.

117
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:04,181
Strike true.

118
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:13,458
-At last, I think this
blasted fog is lifting.

119
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:17,295
-Look-- they're standing still,
like they're squaring off.

120
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:17,930
-Yeah?

121
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:19,998
I can't see a thing.

122
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:23,602
-Which one of them's
Kakashi Sensei?

123
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,570
One's moving!

124
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,577
Huh?

00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,354
-Huh?

00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:43,959
-Sorry, Naruto, change of plan.

[grunting]

[grunting]

131
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:10,188

Oh.

Zabuza.

-So my future is
all used up, huh?

-Don't be ridiculous.

148
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,925
You are not going to the
bridge all by yourself.

149
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:50,165
-I have to go by myself,
because none of the others

150
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,202
will come with me.

151
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:55,238
I have no choice.

152
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,607
-You shouldn't go at all.

153
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,252
Stop this.

154
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:09,487
You're only a child.

155
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,957
What do you think you can do?

156
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,025
-You're right.

157
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:14,827
I am just a kid.

158
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,464
But a kid who knows what it
means to stand and fight.

159
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:20,099
I'm my father's kid.

-Kaiza.

161
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:33,848
No, Inari, wait.

00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,783

What?

Where'd he go?

00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:43,892
Huh?

168
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,927
Hey!

169
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,296
Uh!

170
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,800
The fog's lifting.

171
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,137
Wait, is that him?

172
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:58,642
[panting]

173
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:08,920
-What?

174
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:09,954
I don't get it.

175
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,423
What the heck's going on here?

176
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,102
-Isn't that-- the young
man in the mask, the boy

177
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,137
threw himself in
front of my attack.

178
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:34,649
He saved your worthless
life, at the cost of his own.

179
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:38,920
[laughing]

180
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:42,324
-Well done, Haku.

181
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:43,892
[grunting]

182
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:46,629
[shouting]

183
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:48,597
-Professor Sensei, watch out!

184
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:52,501
-He attacked right through
the boy to take me down.

185
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:56,206
I knew I'd found a treasure
when I found you, boy.

186
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,179
You've not only given me my
life, but Kakashi's as well!

187
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:09,354
[grunting]

188
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,823
-My time here is done, Haku.

189
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:15,827
Tonight, I cast aside
the land of water.

190
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:19,198
One day, I will return
and seize this land

191
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,900
and hold it in my hands.

192
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,636
Many things must be done
before that day comes,

193
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,807
and you will help me to do them.

194
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,843
But I warn you, friendship,
comfort, encouragement--

195
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:34,815
I do not need these things-- nor
should you expect them from me.

196
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,184
-I understand.

197
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,986
I am yours, Zabuza.

198
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,589
I am only an instrument
of your will.

199
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:43,292
Think of me as a weapon
to be kept at your side

200
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:48,063
and used as you see fit.

201
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,131
-Well said, child.

202
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,243
[screaming]

203
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,919
[laughing]

204
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:11,356
-Not bad for having a
corpse in your arms.

205
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:13,325
-You'll pay for that!

206
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,761
-No, stay out of this, Naruto.

207
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,487
-This is my battle.

208
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,289
Zabuza's mine.

209
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:49,466
-Naruto?

210
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:50,433
Naruto!

211
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,034
Over here!

212
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:54,004
Naruto!

213
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,538
-Sakura.

214
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:59,209
-So you and Sasuke
are all right?

215
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:01,312
-Uh, um--

216
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:03,114
-What's wrong?

217
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:05,483
Where is Sasuke anyway?

218
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:07,018
-Uh, uh--

219
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:10,755
-No.

220
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:16,696
-Sakura.

221
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:21,601
-Kakashi, I'd stay
focused if I were you.

222
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:24,470
[grunting]

223
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:26,673
-Let me take you to him, Sakura.

224
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,809
As long as we stay
together, you won't

225
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:32,113
be disobeying your
Sensei's orders.

226
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:33,014
-Thank you.

227
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,458
-Sasuke?

228
00:16:56,073 --> 00:17:01,946
[gasps]

229
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:09,488
[gasps]

230
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:18,464
[gasps]

231
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:19,065
-Uh!

232
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:26,273
Oh, his body's cold.

233
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:31,612
This isn't just one of his
genjutsu tricks, is it?

234
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:32,981
-Go on.

235
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:35,884
You don't need to be
brave on my account.

236
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,252
Go ahead and let your
feelings out, Sakura.

237
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,221
It's all right.

238
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:52,703
-I was the best, aced
every test at the academy--

239
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:55,138
the perfect student.

240
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:55,739
-Hmm?

241
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:01,112
-Did you know there are
more than 100 principles

242
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,414
of shinobi conduct?

243
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,083
I memorized every single one.

244
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:09,687
I used to love it when they
tested us on them-- gave me

245
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,658
a chance to show
how smart I was.

246
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,661
I remember so clearly
this one exam.

247
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,832
They asked us to explain
the 25th principle.

248
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:22,536
I got it right, of course.

249
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:28,208
[sobbing]

250
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:31,746
A shinobi never shows
his feelings, no matter

251
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,714
what the circumstances.

252
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:38,620
Feelings are a weakness that
only cloud his judgement

253
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:41,122
and weaken his sense of duty.

254
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:45,027
[sobbing]

255
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,262
Sasuke!

256
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:52,735
-To put such a unbearable burden
on a young girl's shoulders--

257
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:57,641
if that's the shinobi
way, you can have it!

258
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:03,214
[sobbing]

259
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:11,590
[grunting]

260
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:16,161
[sobbing]

261
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:26,540
[panting]

262
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:30,111
-Why, why can't I
keep up with him?

263
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,853
[grunting]

264
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,605
I'll split you in half!

265
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:01,579
[grunting]

266
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:02,980
-Look at you!

267
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,950
You're falling apart.

268
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:08,620
I knew you didn't have what
it takes for the long haul.

269
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:09,888
-What did you say?

270
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:13,225
-You have no idea
what real strength is.

271
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,366
[panting]

272
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:21,134
Well, well.

273
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,303
So this is how it
turns out, huh?

274
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:30,511
Game over.

275
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:31,279
You lose.

276
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,957
-Uh.

277
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,038
-Huh?

278
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:01,245
-Now both of your
arms are useless.

279
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,246
What now?

280
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,650
You can't even make hand signs.

281
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,086
[grunting]

282
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,101
-Hmm?

283
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,058
[gasps]

284
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,893
-Did quite a job on
you, didn't he, Zabuza?

285
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:17,163
You look like
yesterday's sashimi.

286
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,669
I must say I'm disappointed.

287
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,155
-Haku gave his life
for you, and you

288
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,959
act like nothing happened--
not a single tear, no sign

289
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,460
that you feel anything at all.

290
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:19,266
I knew you were low, Zabuza,
as rotten as they come.

291
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,869
But that-- man, you're
going to pay for that.

292
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,671
Believe it.

293
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:28,442
I only hope someone else
doesn't get to you first.

294
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:32,487
-Next time, The
Demon in the snow.
