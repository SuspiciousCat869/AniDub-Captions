[theme music]

2
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:52,476
-All right, Guy.

3
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,242
We'll leave Sasuke
in your hands.

4
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,176
-Master Jiraiya?

5
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,442
-Hmm.

6
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,376
-Find the Lady Tsunade.

7
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,609
Bring her back to us.

8
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:09,109
-Don't worry, you
could count on us.

9
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,209
We'll have her back in
the village in no time!

10
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,276
-[laugh]

11
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:24,476
-Naruto, nothing impresses
me more than guys, kid.

12
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,209
Come here, let me give you this.

13
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,776
Lee got stronger with this.

14
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:31,709
-Really, what, what is it?

15
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,542
-Check it out!

16
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:52,442
It's breathable,
retains moisture,

17
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,109
and offers complete
freedom of movement,

18
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:57,176
all in one sweet package.

19
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,609
If you where it
while you training,

20
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,476
you'll notice a
difference immediately.

21
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,309
They really grow on you.

22
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:06,776
Pretty soon, you'll be wearing
them all time, just like Lee.

23
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:11,109
I've got a bit of a
thing for them myself.

24
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,109
-Oh, man!

25
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:19,909
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
If you're going

26
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,642
to walk around
carrying that thing,

27
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:24,042
you ought to pack a hand
mirror or two, you idiot.

28
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,576
-Pretty cool, huh?

29
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:38,242
-Don't even think about it.

30
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:40,509
I mean, look at that guy.

31
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,142
-Huh?

32
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,342
-Man, now that is goofy.

33
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:56,309
-All right.

34
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:57,442
This is it.

35
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:57,942
Huh?

36
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,976
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): This is the
biggest gambling hole in town.

37
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,409
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
I know that he's

38
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:22,076
the one you're really after.

39
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,909
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
You're right.

40
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:27,276
Naruto is the prize that
the Akatski are after.

41
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,342
And we will have him.

42
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,276
-What's up?

43
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:41,342
-So, Pervy Sage, what
exactly do those guys

44
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,342
want with me, anyway?

45
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,142
Come on, out with a Pervy Sage.

46
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,342
You know, don't you?

47
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:55,776
-Don't get the wrong idea.

48
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,209
It's not you they want.

49
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,176
It's what's inside of you.

50
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,742
-What the hell is
this thing, anyway?

51
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:09,676
Some horrible demon that
terrorized the Leaf Village.

52
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,876
That's why everyone is
so afraid of it, right?

53
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:13,976
So why do these
guys want it so bad?

54
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,942
-The Nine-tailed
Fox has appeared

55
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,542
in times of consequence,
all through the ages--

56
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:27,442
a ghastly spirit destroying
all that lays in its path.

57
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:31,876
As powerful as any act of
nature, men trembled before it.

58
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:42,009
As for what they would want
with that malicious monstrosity,

59
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,842
that's a hard question
to answer, Naruto.

60
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,709
I honestly can't say.

61
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:51,342
I suppose with the Nine-Tails
sealed up inside you,

62
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,909
they might be thinking
of somehow seizing

63
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:56,609
control of that power,
bending it to their will.

64
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:03,109
It's a bitter pill to swallow
knowing that those, too,

65
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:04,476
will be after you now.

66
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:06,742
But that is your fate.

67
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:07,709
Not to worry, though.

68
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,476
After all, you will
have me around.

69
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,309
-Oh well, I'll just have to
hurry up and get stronger.

70
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:13,009
No other choice.

71
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,042
All right.

72
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,409
Let's find the Tsunade
woman you're talking,

73
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:21,209
so she can fix up
Sasuke, and we get down

74
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,242
to some serious training.

75
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:28,709
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): The kid
has got a one-track mind.

76
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,819
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): A
new training begins.

77
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,319
I will be strong.

78
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:44,319
--[scream] This place has
the highest minimum in town.

79
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,286
-Don't get your
panties in a bunch.

80
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,686
Let's do this.

81
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,386
-Oh, wait for me.

82
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,819
-Hmm.

83
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:58,519
-What now?

84
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,019
-This beautiful
woman that you've

85
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,086
got us out here
scouting around for,

86
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,786
is she the Tsunade
that you mentioned?

87
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,152
-Hey, not bad, kid.

88
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:07,719
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?

89
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,352
Why, what's on your mind, then?

90
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:12,586
-Well, you said she was one
of the three legendary Sannin,

91
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:14,819
the same as you,
right, Pervy Sage?

92
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,986
-That's right.

93
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,186
What's your point, already?

94
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,186
-How old is she?

95
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,119
-Same age as me.

96
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:23,786
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Yuck, she's ancient.

97
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,319
MAN (VOICEOVER): Huh?

98
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:38,886
Wait, she's--

99
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,319
-Here's all my cash.

100
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:51,919
You think I could
get some chips?

101
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,286
-She's going all in.

102
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:05,186
-Looks like a
pretty big spender.

103
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,086
Who is this broad?

104
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:06,852
-You are kidding.

105
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,952
You never heard of her?

106
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:11,352
She's the one with
the crazy nickname.

107
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:11,852
-Nickname?

108
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:18,152
-So, what's this Tsunade
lady like, anyway?

109
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,886
-Ah, curious, are you?

110
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,786
-Yeah.

111
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,652
-What can I tell you.

112
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:26,686
Well, for one thing,
she's kind of unpleasant.

113
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,452
Plus, I guess there's
the fact that she's

114
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:31,386
known far and wide as a
die hard gambler and all.

115
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,352
-Great.

116
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,552
This should be a
piece of cake, then,

117
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:35,552
if she's as famous as all that.

118
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,586
-Oh, she's famous, all right.

119
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,286
You might even
call her legendary.

120
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:48,586
-So what's this crazy
nickname she's got?

121
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,086
-The Legendary.

122
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:50,586
-Legendary?

123
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:59,219
[laughter]

124
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,619
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): Why
are they all laughing?

125
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:20,552
-The Legendary Sucker.

126
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,819
But as legendary a
sucker as she may be,

127
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:29,319
I doubt she's going to
be all that easy to find.

128
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,652
-Why, what makes you say that?

129
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:34,419
-She's not the type to
grow old gracefully.

130
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:38,419
Probably using some kind of
jutsu to mask her appearance.

131
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,586
She's actually 50
years old, but I'm

132
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:44,552
sure she'll look more
like she did in her '20s.

133
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:45,486
That's not all.

134
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,019
The word on the
wind I hear of late

135
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:50,219
is she started transforming on
the fly, going from her teens,

136
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,886
to her 30s, her 40s--
all so she can cut out

137
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,386
on any money lender
she's in too deep with.

138
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,486
-That's awful.

139
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,452
Aww, man.

140
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,152
She sounds like a charmer.

141
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:02,086
-Yeah, well Tsunade's
always loved gambling more

142
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,186
than anything.

143
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,252
It's too bad she never
had any luck-- or skill,

144
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,352
for that matter.

145
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,352
She was made a
sucker so many times,

146
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,852
the name just stuck with her.

147
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,686
But then she would
just borrow money

148
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,452
and skip out on her debts.

149
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:19,186
It brings me back, I tell you.

150
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,819
-Hey, we don't have
time for nostalgia.

151
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,052
-What?

152
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,352
-Come on, do you have a plan
for finding her or what?

153
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:25,986
-Not exactly.

154
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,686
We might have a little
work ahead of us.

155
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:30,119
But I'm sure you and will
come up with something.

156
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:33,686
-Uh, so you don't even have the
slightest idea how long this

157
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,219
is going to take, do you?

158
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:38,686
-Not a minute will be wasted.

159
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,119
All our time on the road will
be devoted solely to you.

160
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,752
-To me?

161
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,986
-We've got to get you stronger.

162
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:47,919
Time to train.

163
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:58,152
[groan]

164
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,086
-OK!

165
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,586
-Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

166
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,152
Hold on a second.

167
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,086
I already told you,
I'm not having that.

168
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,686
I don't want to be
seen walking around

169
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,719
with someone wearing
that, that, that thing.

170
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,738
-Come on, Pervy Sage,
what are we waiting for?

171
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,072
Let's start my training already.

172
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,872
-All right, don't get
ahead of yourself now.

173
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,838
I have to train you while we
gather information on Tsunade.

174
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:30,672
Otherwise, it's not going
to mean anything to you.

175
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:31,338
-Huh?

176
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:32,105
Gather information?

177
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,638
-In this town.

178
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:39,138
-Whoa!

179
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,305
Ah man, this is
going to be great.

180
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,438
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

181
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:58,805
-Downtime is important.

182
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:01,572
So have a little fun before
we start your training.

183
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,805
This festival will be
going on for a while.

184
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,305
We'll hunker down
here until it's over.

185
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,272
And then we'll start
your training here too.

186
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:08,772
-All right!

187
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:20,538
-Oh, baby, that is one
fat frog you've got.

188
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:21,605
Your filthy rich.

189
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,738
-Yeah, I've got a
pretty big stash.

190
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:26,805
I've been saving up bit
by bit from my missions.

191
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,205
Catch you later!

192
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:29,305
-Stop right there, Naruto.

193
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:30,405
-Huh?

194
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:33,138
-I'm going to hold onto
your wallet for you.

195
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:35,305
-Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

196
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,605
-Here, you can have
this much to spend.

197
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:38,972
-What?

198
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,538
Only 300?

199
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:42,905
-I don't want to hear it.

200
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,738
Honoring the shinobi's
three prohibitions

201
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:47,072
is the duty of any
upstanding ninja?

202
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:48,105
-The three prohibitions?

203
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,305
What are you talking about?

204
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,272
-You're kidding.

205
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,172
Don't you know?

206
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,838
The three prohibitions
are a trio

207
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,505
of temptations that
will bring a shinobi

208
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:58,905
to his ruin-- those three
prohibitions are alcohol,

209
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,638
pretty women, and,
worst of all, money.

210
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,538
-Yeah, well none of
those things really

211
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:06,072
apply to me all that
much, so we're cool.

212
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:08,338
I mean, I'm underage,
so I can't drink yet.

213
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,738
I don't really get
the whole woman thing.

214
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,105
And I worked so hard to save
all that money that I really

215
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:15,738
don't feel like
spending a ton of it.

216
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:16,938
-You little fool!

217
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:18,472
Don't take money lightly.

218
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:22,272
Once you start spending,
you'll never stop.

219
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:24,772
Money possess a frightful power.

220
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,038
This woman, Tsunade,
that we're searching for,

221
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,605
has ruined herself
with the pursuit of it.

222
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:33,038
-Pretty big talk coming
from someone so addicted

223
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,338
to the ladies.

224
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:37,238
-I'm going to go see if I
can gather some information.

225
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:40,205
Here, I want you to hold
on to my bag for me, OK?

226
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,838
If you happen to
get lost somehow,

227
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:43,672
you can always rely
on my tracker toad

228
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:45,338
to sniff out my scent.

229
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,738
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): I've
got to keep reminding myself

230
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:52,738
he's still just a kid.

231
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,205
-OK, the first thing I need
is little something to eat.

232
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,405
Can I get an order
of octopus dumplings?

233
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,405
VENDOR: Sure thing.

234
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:10,738
NARUTO: Three
potatoes with butter.

235
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:11,772
VENDOR: Coming up!

236
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,172
NARUTO: Six
chocolate-covered bananas.

237
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:14,238
VENDOR: Okie dokie.

238
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,072
NARUTO: Six piece
of apricot candy.

239
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,138
VENDOR: Thank you.

240
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,638
NARUTO: Three orders
of okonomiyaki.

241
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:21,772
VENDOR: Here you go,
syrup is on the side.

242
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:25,072
-One extra large order
of fried noodles, please.

243
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,905
-You've go it that sure is a
lot of food you got there, son.

244
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,805
You don't plan to eat all
of it yourself, do you?

245
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:33,305
-Huh, well that was
kind of the idea.

246
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,338
-Here you go.

247
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:40,338
-Uh.

248
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:43,272
I think I might
have eaten too much.

249
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,405
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I wonder
how everyone is doing.

250
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:53,805
Kakashi sensei, Sasuke, Sakura?

251
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:56,005
I'm going to train
hard every day

252
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,872
and come back to
you even stronger.

253
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,805
Wait and see.

254
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:03,672
But first, I'd better
work off all that food.

255
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:04,638
Last one.

256
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,072
Bulls eye!

257
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,538
Right on target.

258
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:12,005
[cheering]

259
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:13,972
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): All
that shuriken training

260
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:14,772
wasn't for nothing.

261
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:21,938
Huh?

262
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,972
-Man kid, you stink.

263
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,038
-Yeah, we'll see.

264
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,872
Get a load of this.

265
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,672
-Not so fast.

266
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,172
-What?

267
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:37,172
Attention shinobi--
ninjutsu strictly forbidden?

268
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,672
Oh.

269
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,172
-Thank you.

270
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,838
-Careful kid, you shouldn't
walk around with that mask on.

271
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:59,405
-Hey, it's the Pervy
Sage's checkbook.

272
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:07,638
1, 10, 100-- look
all those zeroes.

273
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:10,738
Jeez, he should be treating me
right now if he's this loaded.

274
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:12,038
For crying out loud.

275
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,005
Cheap old geezer.

276
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,505
Not much left.

277
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,738
One more stand, and that
will be it for the day.

278
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,538
-We've got to get you stronger.

279
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,338
Time to train.

280
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:35,705
-Hey, how's it going.

281
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:37,705
I'd like to get two
grilled squid, please.

282
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,472
And make one of those big
enough for a grown-up.

283
00:16:40,505 --> 00:16:41,472
-OK, coming up.

284
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,572
Got sent on a squid run, huh?

285
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,572
Tell you what.

286
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,238
I'll throw in the
kid size for free.

287
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,305
-Thanks a lot, Mr.
You're the man.

288
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:49,972
-Oh, you think so, huh?

289
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,372
Well, you're getting half
price on that other squid, too.

290
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:53,005
-Wow, thanks!

291
00:16:55,972 --> 00:17:00,138
- Good grief, where
did he run off to?

292
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:01,305
-[laughing]

293
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,372
-Huh?

294
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:03,472
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Was that Pervy Sage?

295
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:10,538
--[laughing] What can
say, I love the ladies!

296
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,605
Oh, hey kid, Had your fill
the festival already, huh?

297
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:25,472
-I need a refresher.

298
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:28,405
What were those
prohibitions of yours again?

299
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,772
What's the matter with you?

300
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:32,972
You're breaking all three
in one go, you dirty--

301
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,005
-Uh, wait, Naruto.

302
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,372
-Wait, shmait.

303
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,505
I can't believe you squandered
all my hard-earned savings!

304
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:40,505
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

305
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:43,005
Lousy good for nothing!

306
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,505
Look at my froggie,
it's flat as a pancake.

307
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:48,438
-Watch it.

308
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:53,005
Look what you did,
you little punk!

309
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,405
-Huh?

310
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:57,638
-You stained the boss' brand new
designer suit, you street rat.

311
00:17:57,672 --> 00:18:01,938
You're paying for
that, $100,000 large!

312
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,038
-What?

313
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:04,572
You're telling me that
suit costs $100,000?

314
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,472
-That seems a little bit
of a stretch, fellas.

315
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:10,238
You expect us to believe that
monkey suit is worth $100,000?

316
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,938
-You looking for
trouble, old man?

317
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:14,305
You'll shut your yap if you
know what's good for you.

318
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,438
-The boss used to be a
Chunin from the Hidden

319
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,738
Village of the Stones.

320
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:21,472
The Legendary Dark Ninja
feared across the land.

321
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:24,005
-Aw, this I've got to hear.

322
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,072
The legendary what, now?

323
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,772
-You're asking for it, pal.

324
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,172
Just keep pushing.

325
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,872
-Naruto, this is perfect timing.

326
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:35,805
I have a new jutsu
I want to show you.

327
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,805
Now, pay attention.

328
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:38,772
-Enough already.

329
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:48,638
-That was awesome.

330
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:55,672
-And I was holding back.

331
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:58,005
Oh, you guys are hardly
worth the trouble.

332
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:07,138
-Wait a minute,
you're the legendary--

333
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:08,372
-Sorry about that.

334
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:11,505
I guess we kind of
messed up your stand.

335
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:13,772
Here, this should cover it.

336
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,438
-Oh, thanks a lot.

337
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,805
Now then, my good man.

338
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:19,438
I'd like to buy
every balloon you've

339
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,038
got, including water balloons.

340
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,372
How's that sound?

341
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:23,672
-Fine by me, I guess.

342
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:30,705
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That
was no ordinary hand move.

343
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:32,638
What the heck kind
of Jutsu was that?

344
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,438
-Naruto.

345
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,772
Let's get going.

346
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,872
Time for you to train.

347
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:38,372
-Yes, sir!

348
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:48,772
All right.

349
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,538
It's finally time to
get down to business.

350
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:51,572
-Here you go.

351
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:53,305
Have a water balloon.

352
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,072
-Huh?

353
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,638
What the heck is this for?

354
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:56,838
-Just think about it.

355
00:19:56,872 --> 00:20:00,372
You saw the Jutsu
I performed, right?

356
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:04,238
And how would you describe it?

357
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:07,272
-You sent that guy
spinning like a pinwheel.

358
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:09,505
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Ah,
he's not quite getting it.

359
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:12,072
But I've got an idea.

360
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:12,572
-Good.

361
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:13,205
Spinning.

362
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,405
There you go.

363
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:15,772
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
He's spinning

364
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:19,072
the water in that balloon
without even moving his hand.

365
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,272
Whoa!

366
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,072
-With the tree
climbing exercise,

367
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:28,138
you learn to gather
and maintain chakra.

368
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,038
With the water
walking exercise, you

369
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,038
learn to release a
steady amount of it.

370
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:35,838
Both of these you've
mastered, correct?

371
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:37,905
With the water balloon
exercise, you'll

372
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:40,638
learn to create a stream
of chakra, spinning it,

373
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,505
as you so apply put it.

374
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,972
-I'm supposed to create
a stream of chakra?

375
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:47,372
-Don't worry.

376
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:49,772
I'll go into more detail on
how the Jutsu works once you've

377
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:52,038
gotten a handle of the basics.

378
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:54,272
First, gather the
chakra in your hand

379
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:56,338
using the tree
climbing technique.

380
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:58,605
Then release a
steady stream of it

381
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,705
using the walk on
water technique.

382
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:03,405
And finally, use the
chakra to push and churn

383
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:06,072
the water inside of the balloon.

384
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:07,638
-Wait a second, I get it.

385
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:09,172
So what you're
aiming for, then, is

386
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,038
to spin the water
inside the balloon

387
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,572
until it eventually pops.

388
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,638
-Attaboy!

389
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,705
You're starting to
catch on quicker.

390
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:20,338
OK, we'll train until
the sun goes down.

391
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:21,238
NARUTO: Yes, sir!

392
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,596
[theme music]

393
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:01,896
-I'm breaking this
water balloon if it's

394
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:03,863
the last thing I ever do.

395
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:06,896
-Oh, I like your heart, kid.

396
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,729
You might just master it yet.

397
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:14,363
Oh, I think the water
is starting to move.

398
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:17,329
The question is always,
when is it going to pop?

399
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,529
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next
time, keep on training.

400
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:21,863
Pop goes the water balloon.

401
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:25,296
Hey, why can't I
break this balloon?
