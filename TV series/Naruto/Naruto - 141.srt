What have you done with him?

-Heh, I take it you're Naruto.

00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:07,054
If I were to tell you the truth,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

-That's right.

7
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,154
At least not if you
told me he was dead.

Sasuke is alive.

11
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,987
-I promised that I'd
bring Sasuke back,

12
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,921
and I'm the kind of guy who
always keeps his promises.

get past me first.

If I were still the
weakling I once was,

16
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,921
I would tell you everything
you want to know.

know is dead and gone.

That was actually close.

let down my guard.

Too bad, Naruto.

You all had your chance for a
sneak attack and you muffed it.

-Naruto?

51
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:54,487
-All to try and rescue
that worthless dead weight.

get to you, Sakura.

It'll take more than
this to stop me.

You're badly hurt.

it's only a flesh wound.

it's only a flesh wound.

You won't be laughing for long.

-You know what?

00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,365
You're right.

71
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,965
Because this farce
is just about over.

72
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:34,199
Kamikiri, Jigumo, fuse
your chakra with mine.

73
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,565
Give it all to me.

-Huh?

78
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:01,199
It's a forbidden
jutsu known only

79
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,299
to the ancient chiefs
of the Fuma Clan.

80

-Forbidden?

81
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,765
Why?

Spell of the Mandara.

is this thing?

As the chakra cage
shrinks, the person within

00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:45,032
is crushed smaller
and smaller until both

89
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,865
are the size of a pebble.

90
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,599
What's more, there's
no way to break free.

91
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:54,865
Not while I maintain the jutsu
and keep up the pressure.

I'm still no use at all.

-No, Arashi.

You can't do this.

Come back to me.

I know you haven't gone.

You're still in there
somewhere, I know it.

-As I told you before, the
Arashi you used to know

111
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:08,965
is dead.

-Forgive me, Sasame.

115

All I wanted was the power
to help the Fuma Clan find

116

its place in the sun once again.

-Yes, I know.

118
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,932
I do understand.

119
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,565
But it's over now.

120
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,899
You can come home.

121
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,232
Come back to the village.

-Never again.

123

Look at me.

124
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,332
I've become a monster.

-No, that's not true.

-If you knew the agony, Sasame.

127
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,199
End this.

me out of my misery--

Is that what you want?

Huh?

-Death's not something
to be afraid of.

140
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,751
Sasame taught me that.

141
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:55,251
-Oh.

142
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:04,084
-Worse than death is a
life that helps no one.

143
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,451
I'm not afraid of
giving my life if it

144
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,517
will help someone
who's important to me.

What do you think
you can do about it?

I never meant to cause
you so much suffering.

You're the one that
suffered, not me.

Tell me, tell me, isn't
there anything I can do?

170
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,784
-You've already done it, Sasame.

171
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,084
See?

172
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,351
It's only thanks to you that
I'm finally myself again.

173
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:15,651
-Naruto.

174
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:21,251
-Sakura.

175
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:24,551
Promise me that you won't
ever try that again.

176
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,484
No life should be
thrown away, not

177
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:28,151
even for the sake
of someone else.

178
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,617
Sakura, watch out!

179
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:44,017
Huh?

180
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,017
Pervy Sage?

181
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,817
-Sorry if I'm late.

182
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,051
I was held up.

183
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:52,017
You aren't the only ones
who had their hands full.

184
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:53,384
-Well, that's typical.

185
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,584
JIRAIYA: Shake a leg, you two.

186
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:57,584
Come on up.

187
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,817
Let's get back above ground.

188
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:00,317
Hm?

189
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,617
Huh?

190
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,617
-Is she all right?

191
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,717
-She's fine.

192
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,284
She just fainted, that's all.

193
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:20,084
ARASHI: Naruto.

194
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:23,051
Now I can finally tell you
the truth-- the mission

195
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,251
that Orochimaru gave us.

196
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:27,384
He wanted to make sure
that no one took Sasuke

197
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,984
back to the Hidden Leaf
Village, no matter what.

198
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,184
-Then Sasuke must be--

199
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,451
-That's right.

200
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,851
He's alive.

201
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:39,117
Sasuke is the vessel
Orochimaru plans to inhabit.

202
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:40,717
But that can't happen
for three years,

203
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:45,151
so he has to keep
him safe until then.

204
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,151
-Arashi?

205
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,284
Are you coming?

206
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:50,651
-Yeah, get up here, hurry.

207
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:54,617
This place is about to cave in.

208
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,584
[groaning]

209
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,917
-I'm only a puppet
like these two.

210
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,384
This is where I belong now.

211
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:07,884
-Arashi.

212
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:13,817
-Let's go.

213
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,284
SASAME: No!

214
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:15,784
No!

215
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:24,651
ARASHI (VOICEOVER):
Good bye, Sasame.

216
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:25,617
And thank you.

217
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,717
HANZAKI: The loss of
Arashi was only part

218
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,351
of the terrible price
that had to be paid.

219
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:53,651
But the Fuma Clan is
finally free of Orochimaru.

220
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,999
-And free to rebuild
your clan anew.

221
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,366
-And we will.

222
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,766
I know how to begin.

223
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,866
With this-- this life
that I wouldn't even

224
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,499
have without Arashi's help.

225
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,799
We are all grateful
for what you've done.

226
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,899
-It was our pleasure.

227
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,366
-Hanzaki, look after these two.

228
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,766
-I will.

229
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,999
Travel safely, sensei.

230
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:28,733
-Thank you.

231
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,499
-Good bye.

232
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,099
-Thank you for everything.

233
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,233
-Good bye.

234
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:34,466
Good luck to all of you.

235
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,733
Oh well, look on
the bright side.

236
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,566
We may have failed
to find Sasuke,

237
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:46,199
but at least we learned
that he's still alive.

238
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,333
What's more, we now
know what Orochimaru

239
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:49,433
has in store for him.

240
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,433
And that means we
have time on our side.

241
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,233
It seems we have
three years before he

242
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:56,366
takes over Sasuke's
body as a vessel.

243
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,366
-Right.

244
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,999
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasame knew
what she had to do for her clan

245
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,166
and she did it.

246
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,166
Once again, I was incapable
of doing anything,

247
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,033
depending on Naruto to
come through as usual.

248
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:15,833
-Sakura, that was a
great effort back there.

249
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,899
-No, Arashi was right.

250
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,299
I'm just so much dead weight.

251
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm useless on my own.

252
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,499
-Are you kidding me?

253
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,099
Seeing you put your
life on the line

254
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,466
like that was the
only thing that

255
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:32,399
gave me the guts to carry on.

256
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,599
If it hadn't been
for you, I'd have

257
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,266
been crushed to
bits in that thing.

258
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,933
It's only because of you
that we both survived.

259
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,099
-Thanks for that.

260
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,533
-Hey, hey, hey.

261
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,599
Well said.

262
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,599
You've become quite
a sensitive fellow.

263
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,333
-Hey, put me down, Pervy Sage.

264
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:51,766
What do you think I am?

265
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,733
A sack of garbage?

266
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:53,666
Come on, knock it off.

267
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,233
-Oops, that's right.

268
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,866
I forgot. [laughing]

269
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,299
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
All I was thinking

270
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,933
of at that moment was
protecting someone I care about.

271
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,266
Maybe that's what
I'm capable of.

272
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,633
-You know, I've been thinking.

273
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,599
-About what?

274
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:26,633
-Of course, I realize there's
a lot of variables involved--

275
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,133
the size of the squad and
the nature of the mission.

276
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,666
But I think it would be a
good idea if every squad had

277
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,499
at least one member of the
Medical Corps assigned to it.

278
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,233
-You certainly don't
have to convince me.

279
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:41,166
I wrote a report long ago that
explained how such a move would

280
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,099
greatly increase our rate
of success and survival.

281
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:47,466
Problem is it takes a long time
to train Medical Corps shinobi.

282
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,633
They need a whole
different set of skills

283
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,533
than fighting shinobi.

284
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,199
Like perfect mastery and
precision of chakra control,

285
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:01,299
comprehension of a vast amount
of specialized knowledge,

286
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,099
the brains to know how
to apply it, patience.

287
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,666
But of course, the most
important attribute for anyone

288
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:13,966
who wants to call themselves a
Medical Corps shinobi-- later.

289
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,533
I'm just a little
busy at the moment.

290
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,533
-The most important attribute.

291
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:22,466
Huh.

292
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,833
-Look at this.

293
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,033
My hands are all
wrapped up in bandages.

294
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,833
How am I going to
hold chopsticks?

295
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,699
I'm going to starve.

296
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,799
Hey, Sakura.

297
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,566
I've got a great idea.

298
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,633
You can sit beside
my bed and feed me.

299
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,266
I'll go like this, K?

300
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,566
Uh, Sakura?

301
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,166
[door opening]

302
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:40,633
-Huh?

303
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,833
Hey, don't worry, Sakura.

304
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,866
Really, I was only kidding.

305
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:47,966
SAKURA: Sorry, Naruto.

306
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:48,466
-Huh?

307
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,566
SAKURA: You may have to
wait for me a little bit.

308
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:05,366
But next time, I promise
I won't be dead weight.

309
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:13,799
-Huh?

TSUNADE: Come in.

-I'm here to make
a request, milady.

313
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,366
-What is it?

314
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,499
-I would like to
be your apprentice.

315
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,099
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Poor thing.

316
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,966
You must really be desperate.

317
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:58,199
-Sakura Haruno, I'm told
that you have a fine mind,

318
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,799
and that your will is strong.

319
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:07,166
Very well.

320
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,133
But be warned, I
won't go easy on you.

321
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:10,633
-Understood.

322
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,766
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
That a girl.

323
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,899
Looks like we accomplished
more on this mission

324
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:22,899
than we thought.

325

[theme music]

326
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,444
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): That
lazy old Pervy Sage.

327
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:06,644
(MOCKING JIRAIYA) You'll
be my only student, Naruto.

328
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,277
I'll make a full-fledged
shinobi out of you.

329
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,044
Yeah right.

330
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:11,911
So when do we get started?

331
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:15,177
Meanwhile, Grandma Tsunade's
got Sakura on the fast track.

332
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,377
She's in full training, 24-7.

333
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,544
And what am I doing?

334
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,277
Sitting around,
waiting for Pervy Sage

335
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,077
to get back from
some stupid mission.

336
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,011
Ugh.

337
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,011
I mean, where are
his priorities?

338
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:28,311
Next time-- The Three Villains
From the Maximum Security

339
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:29,425
Prison.
