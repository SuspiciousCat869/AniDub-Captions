[theme song]

2
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,399
-Listen, I already
told you everything

3
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,668
I know about the guy.

4
00:01:54,702 --> 00:01:58,346
-So you first met Genno
at the ramen shop.

5
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,652
-What did the two
of you discuss?

6
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,559
-You expect me to
remember everything?

7
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,665
-That's what we're
here for, yes.

8
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:07,370
-If we analyze
your conversation,

9
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:10,678
we might determine who
Genno was working for.

10
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:11,814
-Uh.

11
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,087
-We're familiar with all
of your conversations

12
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,657
over the last two weeks.

13
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:19,134
Now we want to know what
was said before that.

14
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:21,072
-You can ask me all you want.

15
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,643
I'm tell you, I don't remember.

16
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:28,626
-Then we'll have to put you
under regressive hypnosis.

17
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,161
-Huh?

18
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:31,100
Regressive hypnosis?

19
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,840
-Using hypnosis, we can
recover lost memories

20
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:36,614
from your subconscious.

21
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:37,850
-No way!

22
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:40,892
-Just relax.

23
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,899

[sound of ticking clock begins]

25
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,495
Let's begin.

26
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,811
Let yourself travel back through
the pathways of your memory,

27
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:06,794
one day ago, two days
ago, three days ago.

28
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,601
Further into the past.

29
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:14,715
And finally, the day
you met the old man.

30
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,718
Where are you?

31
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,631
-I'm in the woods.

32
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:26,513
I was out there
training on my own.

33
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:31,927
Then it was lunch time,
so I headed for Ichiraku,

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,835
and that's when I saw him.

35
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,944
-So you didn't meet in the
restaurant, but just outside.

36
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,194
-Hey!

37
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:45,230
What you doing?

38
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,099
-Huh?

39
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,803
Oh, me?

40
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,845
I was just trying to decide if I
should go into this restaurant.

41
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,115
Is it any good?

42
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,756
-You're are not from around
here, are you, old-timer?

43
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,927
-Dah, Well, no.

44
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm a freelance carpenter.

45
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,671
How could you tell, young man?

46
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:02,910
--[chuckles] Because everyone
from the Leaf Village knows

47
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,985
that Ichiraku's ramen is the
bestest ramen in the whole

48
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,323
universe!

49
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,895
-Well, that's quite a review.

50
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,701
SERVER: Here you go!

51
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:12,380

-You're right!

54
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,050
This ramen is quite delicious.

55
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,290
-Isn't it?

56
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:22,228
[slurping] (LAUGHING) Ah.

57
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,136
Thanks for the grub!

58
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,308
-You finished your bowl already?

59
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,778
-Well, I am a growing
boy, you know?

60
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:32,121
Even an extra I
can't fill me up!

61
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:33,625
-I see.

62
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:35,296
Then maybe I'll share the
rest of mine with you.

63
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:36,031
-What?

64
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,033
You sure?

65
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,037
-All yours!

66
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:40,309
-It's my lucky day!

67
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:43,184
[slurps ramen] Oh, man.

Thanks a ton!

-Mm-hm.

70
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,191
-Oh, man!

71
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,195
This is good!

72
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,333
[slurping continues]

73
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,971
That's it.

74
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:55,082
Then after we finished our
ramen, we said our good-byes.

75
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:57,087
-When did you meet him next?

76
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,792
-In front of Ichiraku again.

77
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:01,867
-Byakugan.

78
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:18,278
There's nothing here either.

79
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,146
-All right, then.

80
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:28,772
-Byakugan.

00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,585
Oh.

82
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:40,102
-Nothing.

83

[dog whimpers]

84
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,973
-Looks like he must have used
some kind of odor neutralizing

85
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,446
element in last
night's smokescreen.

86
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,317
That guy came prepared.

87
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,422
-Then why did he get caught?

88
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:01,927
-Huh?

89
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,367
I guess the Anbu were just
too intelligent for him.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,971
-Of course they're intelligent.

91
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,179
But he must have
foreseen that going in.

92
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,419
So then, why didn't
he have another escape

93
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:13,759
route planned out in advance?

94
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,762
-You know, you're right.

95
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,198
It doesn't make any sense.

96
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:19,407
But there's really no
way to find out now.

-Dead men tell no tales.

98
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,297
-This way, please.

99
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:36,519
-What are they doing to him?

100
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,025
-We're putting his
body back together.

101
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:42,000
-Do they really have to do that?

102
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,972
TECHNICIAN: He was
in very bad shape.

103
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:47,214
From what I understand, he had
paper bombs from head to toe.

104
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:52,928
Miss, would you like to wait
outside 'til we're done?

105
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,299
-Yes, I think I would.

106
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,037
-I'll stay, thank you.

107
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:56,730
-You will?

108
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,262
[exhales] You're stronger
than I am, Sakura.

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,233
-It had eggs and barbecue
pork, and he treated me

110
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,503
to everything.

111
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,341
-Does this kid only
think about ramen?

112
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,276
-Shh!

113
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,279
-Wait.

114
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:26,552
I remember one other thing.

115
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:27,588
-Huh?

116
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,424
-Yes?

117
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:29,527
What is it?

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,203
-He showed me a photograph.

119
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,473
-A photograph?

120
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:38,985
-It was a picture of some
kid who looked around my age.

121
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,091
It was right after
I asked the old guy

122
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:44,032
why he was being so nice to me.

123
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,107
-Ah, well, I have a grandson.

124
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,110
You see?

125
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,981
He's about the same
age as you are.

126
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,025
So in a way, you're not
really a stranger to me.

127
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:57,167
Some day, after I
retire, my grandson and I

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,643
are going to go off and live
the life of treasure hunters.

129
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:03,250
-Are you serious?

130
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,589
-Yes.

131
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,026
Oh, my word!

132
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,698
You finished your
bowl that fast?

133
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:10,234
-Yup. [laughs]

134
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:13,042
-Then I suppose you'll
just have to finish mine.

135
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,045
-Thanks, old man!

136
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,649
You're the greatest.

137
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:17,989
Huh?

138
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:21,098
Uh, what happened to your hand?

139
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:21,758
-Hm?

140
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:22,668
Oh.

141
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,409
I got this scar when I
cut myself with a saw.

142
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,681
-Oh.

143
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:30,656
And then after that,
the old guy gave me

144
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,695
more of his yummy ramen.

145
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,201
-But Genno has no relatives.

146
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:37,741
-So the story about
his grandson was a lie?

147
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,181
-We started telling
him the day after that.

148
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:42,588
Looks like we're not going to
get any more information out

149
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,092
of the boy.

150
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,796
-I doubt Genno would've
been careless enough

151
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,470
to divulge anything
important, even to a genin.

152
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,653
-An emergency communique
from Lady Tsunade.

[ticking clock]

154
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,672
-Ah mm.

155
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,142
-I see.

156
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,583
So nothing unusual in
any of the buildings?

157
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,223
-They were all built
according to the blueprints.

158
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,629
There are no signs of
any traps or sabotage.

159
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:11,832
-Mm-hm.

160
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,537
-Do you suppose that
he was just acting

161
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,110
like a carpenter as a cover
so he could get passage

162
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,381
into the village?

163
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,520
-Well, it's too soon to
know that for certain.

164
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,093
But if he just came here
to steal those plans,

165
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:25,201
there's no reason to
pretend to be a carpenter.

166
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:27,240
-By the way, while we
were combing the village,

167
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,145
what were you guys looking into?

168
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:30,850
-We talked to some of
this carpenter buddies

169
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,621
down at a site, and
started checking out

170
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,696
a list of all the places
that they said he frequented.

171
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,670
But so far, we haven't
dug up many clues.

172
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,807
-That's weird.

173
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,213
The whole list is restaurants?

174
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,382
-Yeah.

175
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,787
Seems like the only time
the old guy ever went out

176
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,558
was to grab a bite.

177
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,660
OK.

178
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,533
Hinata, go check
on Ino and Sakura

179
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,769
over at the medical center.

180
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:53,476
Neji, Lee, you guys are
with Kiba and Shino.

181
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,512
-(JOINTLY) Um.

182
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:55,181
-Understood.

183
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:02,367
-It's a drag, but we
should head out, too.

184
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,835
-Shikamaru.

185
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,305
-(BOTH) Hm?

186
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,846
-Lady Tsunade has sent for you.

187
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,383
-I wonder what she wants?

188
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:12,861
What?

189
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:15,302
The village hidden
in the waterfalls.

190
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:18,644
-They've moved all their ninja
into battle-ready position.

191
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:22,353
Apparently, they're claiming
it's just a normal training

192
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:23,691
exercise.

193
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,862
-Training exercise, huh?

194
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,434
-Need I say more?

195
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,472
They've used this tactic before.

196
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,413
Assemble all their forces under
the guise of a big practice

197
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:35,856
run, and end up
invading another land.

198
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,527
-And there's more
to it than that.

199
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,499
Apparently, just
before he arrived here,

200
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:42,774
Genno briefly stayed in the
Hidden Waterfall Village.

201
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,680
It wouldn't be
surprising to find out

202
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,618
there's some sort of connection.

203
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:47,955
-Hm.

204
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,994
TSUNADE: We've already
mobilized most of our ninja.

205
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:52,633
They're on their way to
the Waterfall Village now.

206
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,542
If they see anyone
crossing the border,

207
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:58,950
I told them to treat it as
a full-scale enemy invasion.

208
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,422
-Nuh?

209
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,995
-Shikamaru, take your
group and head over

210
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,935
to the border to assist.

211
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,374
-Hm.

212
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,411
Well, if you really
want my honest opinion,

213
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,883
there's no reason for us to go.

214
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:11,785
-Uh.

215
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,924
But, but Shikamaru--

216
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,462
-What are you getting at?

217
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:20,843
SERVER: Naruto?

218
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:21,778
Hey, Naruto!

219
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,381
-Huh?

220
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,020
-If you keep standing
there like a zombie,

221
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,594
you're going to scare
off my customers.

222
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:28,763
-Oh, uh, sorry.

223
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,715
Come to think of it,
I never actually saw

224
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:38,623
that guy finish a
single bowl of ramen.

225
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,300
There's no way he hated ramen
the entire time, is there?

226
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,411
But then, why was he hanging
out of Ichiraku so much?

227
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,015
Mm.

228
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:50,856
[growls]

229
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,939
-Please explain
yourself, Shikamaru.

230
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:59,680
-Sending in 10
genin and 1 chunin,

231
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,517
it's not going to make
too much difference

232
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,087
in the scheme of things.

233
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:05,126
-And what is your point?

234
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,466
-Something's not quite right.

235
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:08,837
-Ah.

236
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,380
-We're missing something
about this guy, Genno.

237
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,987
And I think I figured
out what it is.

238
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,558
All we've learned
about his life is

239
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:19,498
that he was remarkably
unremarkable.

240
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,373
He was an average
carpenter, did his work,

241
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,515
never stood out, never
made any big mistakes.

242
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,386
He didn't have any
friends, didn't have

243
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:28,856
any enemies, either.

244
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:31,731
If he disappeared one day,
nobody would miss him.

245
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,568
They wouldn't think
twice about it.

246
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:36,711
He was the kind of person
who could just fade away.

247
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,457
His undercover
technique was so good,

248
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,830
it ought to be in the
Shinobi textbooks, which

249
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,603
is why it's so odd that
a brilliant Shinobi like

250
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:49,745
that would let himself get
pegged by the Anbu so easily.

251
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,754
Doesn't it seem a
little strange to you?

252
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:53,823
-Yes, that's true.

253
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,202
-And then, when he
was trying to escape,

254
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,976
he had no problem evading
the Black Ops before,

255
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,947
but this time, they caught him.

256
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,591
For a trap expert, it was a
pretty pathetic way to go.

257
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,475
Not to mention the
fact that he just

258
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,080
gave up all those blueprints.

259
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:19,691
It doesn't make
any sense, unless--

260
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:20,995
-Well?

261
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,469
---unless everything that's
happened was part of the plan

262
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,072
from the beginning.

263
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,075
-Uh!

264
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,245
-Could it be?

265
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,184
-His true identity
being revealed.

266
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:30,989
Dying right in front
of the Anbu guys.

267
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:34,698
What if it was all part
of an elaborate plot?

268
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,171
What if he knew we'd be worried
about the Hidden Waterfall

269
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:41,717
Village, that we'd send everyone
away to face that threat?

270
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,957
Leaving our village
defenseless like that,

271
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,265
we might just be dancing
in the palm of his hand.

272
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,569
TSUNADE: Interesting theory.

273
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,306
But all the hard
evidence says we

274
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,114
need to protect ourselves
from this invasion.

275
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,150
-That's true.

276
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,320
But still--

277
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,858
-I hear you.

278
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,729
Sending in a bunch
of lightweights

279
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,704
like 10 genin and 1
chunin, it wouldn't really

280
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,811
change the outcome of
the battle, now would it?

281
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,982
-Ah?

282
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,152
-All right, Shikamaru.

283
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:08,622
I'll have you and
your group continue

284
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:11,162
investigating the
Genno incident.

285
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:11,964
-Mm.

286
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:12,599
Understood.

287
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,613
-Hey guys, where you been?

288
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:18,649
SHIKAMARU: Sorry.

289
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,891
Didn't mean to keep you waiting.

290
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:22,659
-Eh!

291
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,264
This hurts my brain.

292
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,171
Remind me why we have to look
through all these stupid books

293
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,608
again?

294
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:30,045
-Believe me, I don't
want to do it either.

295
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,221
But research is the basis
of good investigation.

296
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,360
-Yeah, but still,
there's so many numbers

297
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,934
my eyes can't take it.

298
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:38,936
-I'm sorry.

299
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,075
I looked everywhere,
but I can't find.

300
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:41,844
-OK.

301
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:42,880
No problem.

302
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,117
-What was that?

303
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,022
-Aw, he was just trying to
find the old recommendation

304
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:49,699
letter that made them realize
the one Genno used was a fake.

305
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,639
-Why the heck did you bother
having him dig that up?

306
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,979
-Just a hunch.

307
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:57,385
(THINKING) I wonder,
did they just lose it,

308
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:00,895
or did the old guy
make it disappear?

309
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,733
Either way, it's still shady.

310
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:06,075
I mean, the forgery's the one
he should have gotten rid of.

311
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,214
Ditching the old letter
does him no good.

312
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:16,035
-This is the spot where
the explosion occurred.

313
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,840
-Looks like somebody
already collected

314
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:20,046
the physical evidence.

315
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,914
-Yeah.

316
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:22,719
The Anbu leave nothing behind.

317
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,997
-Everyone, look!

318
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,434
-(ALL) Hm?

319
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:29,438
-Check out this tree.

320
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,041
It's burned on both sides.

321
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,716
-With all the paper bombs
that went off, of course

322
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:34,952
it got burned.

323
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:37,158
-Yeah, but why is it
charred on both sides?

324
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,361
-She's right.

325
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:39,764
If the blast came
from one direction,

326
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,038
there wouldn't be marks
on the back of it.

327
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,043
-To leave these kinds
of burns, the explosions

328
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,316
would have had to come
from multiple sources.

329
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,421
-But the Anbu saw it happen.

330
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:50,225
And they reported that
all of the paper bombs

331
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,766
were wrapped around the man's
body when they want off!

332
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,470
-Don't be so sure about that.

333
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,877
After all, the Anbu
had to take cover

334
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,848
to protect themselves
from the blast.

335
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:02,124
I doubt any of them witnessed
the actual explosion.

336
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:02,893
-(TOGETHER) Ah!

337
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,171
-Hey!

338
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,244
This one's got burns
on both sides, too!

339
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:11,782
[barking]

340
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:14,323
-The same pattern on this tree.

341
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:15,827
-Wait a sec.

342
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,401
What if a ring of bombs
on the surrounding trees

343
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:22,111
were set off first, then the
huge explosion in the center?

344
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:28,027
If he timed the explosions
close enough to each other,

345
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,865
then it might have
seemed like one blast.

346
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:31,135
-This Is a good point.

347
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:32,839
But in order to
do that, he would

348
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,311
have needed time to set it up.

349
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:37,217
Before he made it here, Genno
was being chased by the Anbu.

350
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,159
And they had him cornered
right when the bombs went off.

351
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,005
-Maybe they chased him, or
maybe he was leading them here.

352
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,208
[all gasp]

353
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:48,348
-So all along, he wasn't
trying to get away from them,

354
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,353
he was drawing
them to this spot?

355
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:51,154
-Hm.

356
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:53,060
It's possible.

357
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,900
-If that is true, then
it is safe to assume

358
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,040
there were other
elements to his plan.

359
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:01,181
-Can we be sure those paper
bombs really took him out?

360
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:01,950
-(TOGETHER) Oh!

361
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,632
-It's over.

362
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,001
You can come back.

363
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:09,664
-O-OK.

364
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:15,319
-I don't get it.

365
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:18,394
Wasn't his identity
confirmed by Anbu?

366
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:19,196
TECHNICIAN: Yeah.

367
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,232
-Oh.

368
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,472
-Well, what do you
mean, take a look?

369
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:23,975
I'm not a medical ninja.

370
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,616
How am I supposed to know
what I'm looking for?

371
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:29,991
I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

372
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,431
Ah.

373
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,102
Sakura!

374
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,576
Our suspect here, he
was undercover working

375
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,647
as a carpenter in
the village, right?

376
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:39,516
-Yeah, that's right.

377
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,520
Why?

378
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,422
Did you notice something?

379
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:42,458
-It's his hand.

380
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,530
It's way too clean.

381
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,106
My family owns a
flower shop, and I've

382
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,412
been serving people
there since I was little.

383
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:55,125
When I see someone's hand, I can
tell what kind of work they do.

384
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,265
Carpenters' hands are
much rougher than this,

385
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:00,606
with scrapes and cuts, and a
tramp ninja's hand would never

386
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,548
be that squeaky clean.

387
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,553
-And what does that mean?

388
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,190
-May I take a look?

389
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:07,692
-(BOTH) What?

390
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,360
-Byakugan!

391
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:13,105
I thought so.

392
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,746
There's no trace of a
developed chakra network.

393
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,553
This man has never
infused his chakra.

394
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,991
-Huh?

395
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,197
-And I overheard the
medics talking outside.

396
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:24,437
Even they have doubts
about his identity.

397
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,740
-(TOGETHER) Uh!

398
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,146
-This person is not a ninja!

399
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,334
-Hm?

400
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:37,337
-Status report.

401
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:38,741
The Hidden Waterfall
Village forces

402
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,780
are about to arrive
at our border, sir.

403
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:42,083
-They're fast.

404
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,088
And what about our defense unit?

405
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,061
-Our troops are
mobilizing quickly,

406
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:48,500
but they're not in full
battle position yet.

407
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,442
-(THINKING) If they launch an
attack before we take defensive

408
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,513
positions, we're done for.

409
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,750
-I just don't get it, sir.

410
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,388
Why would the Hidden
Waterfall Village--

411
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:59,163
-Whatever their reasons,
they don't matter now.

412
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:00,766
Once the enemy
crosses that river,

413
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,106
we must assume they
intend to wage war.

414
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,512
-And we will fight back, sir!

-Hm? (THINKING) The Academy?

417
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,568
I didn't see any
blueprints for the Academy.

Excuse me, sir?

419
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:36,361
Can I ask you something?

420
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:36,829
-Yes.

421
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:37,865
What is it?

422
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,335
-I found records
of some payments

424
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:42,878
-What?

425
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:43,714

00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:47,825

work to the facilities.

-Then how come there aren't
any blueprints for that job?

-What?

432
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,753
Of course, there are.

they could have gone?
