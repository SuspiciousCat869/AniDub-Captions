Do whatever you can
to pin him down.

332
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:46,750
-Right.

333
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:12,114
[hana yells]

334
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:15,689
-We have no other choice now.

335
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,660
Our only option is terminator.

336
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:20,534
-Stop!

337
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,138
Stop it now.

338
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,809
Akamaru.

339
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:24,777
-Kiba?

340
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,670
-Kiba.

341
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:30,447
-Akamaru.

342
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:38,645
What's wrong, boy?

343
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:39,880
Have you forgotten my scent?

344
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:48,000
We've always been
together, haven't we?

345
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:49,036
We grew up together.

346
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,938
Akamaru, please.

347
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,313
Somewhere in there,
somewhere, there

348
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:11,089
has to be a part of
you that remembers.

349
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:14,865
Show me that you remember.

350
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,202
Akamaru!

351
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,741
[Akamaru roars]

352
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,709
-No!

353
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:21,079
-Forgive me.

354
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:23,386
Can you?

355
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,861
I know that I've brought you
nothing but pain and suffering.

356
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,006
I broke my word.

357
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,345
I swore I'd always protect you.

358
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,760
Akamaru?

359
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:41,729
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:48,646
I'm sorry I wasn't
a better master.

361
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,830
I'm here, here for you, forever.

362
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,268
-Kiba.

363
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:25,869
No.

364
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:29,845
-Kiba!

365
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,860
HANA: I don't know if
he would have made it

366
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,334
if the Medical Corps
hadn't arrived so quickly.

367
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,406
TSUNADE: He was fortunate
that Akamaru's attack

368
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,478
missed any vital organs.

369
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:46,853
By all rights, Kiba
should have been-- well.

370
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,891
It's remarkable, really.

371
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,865
He's a very lucky guy.

372
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:52,868
-You're wrong.

373
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,406
-Hey, you're awake.

374
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,915
-It was more than luck that
saved me from that attack.

375
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:00,485
It was him.

376
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,922
Akamaru missed on purpose.

377
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,534
It was him.

378
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,474
He used the last of his strength
to shift the attack just

379
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:10,977
enough.

380
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,918
He fought the monster within
him as hard as he could.

381
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:16,156
And he won.

382
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,861
-Pretty brave, Akamaru.

383
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,471
-He sure is.

384
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:23,441
Thanks, boy.

[theme music]

386
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:06,221
-There are many dark legends
in the world, tales of demons

387
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:09,496
and mysterious monsters
passed down from generation

388
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:12,636
to generation, the
stuff of nightmares.

389
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:15,643
What happens when these monsters
become real and step out

390
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:18,183
of the legends and
into our village?

391
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:20,121
How well will the
Leaf Ninja do when

392
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:24,599
they have to face these demons
and confront their own fears?

Hidden Leaf: The Onbaa!
