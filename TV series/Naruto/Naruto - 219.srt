[theme music]

2
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,401
-End of the line.

3
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:01,270
Now return Matsuri.

4
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:05,241
-You really think
you've got me cornered?

5
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,176
You might want to reassess that.

6
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,312
The only one
trapped here is you.

7
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:09,912
-What?

8
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,451
-Byakugan!

9
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:21,357
Gaara has the final enemy
backed into a dead end canyon.

10
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,458
-Interesting.

11
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,161
The area surrounding the
canyon is pretty calm.

12
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:27,764
I'm not seeing
any other enemies.

13
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:31,734
-I wonder if Shikamaru
figured out a solution?

14
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,102
Doubtful.

15
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,137
There's No.

16
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,406
Way of knowing whether
the fight is over.

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,408
We can't even rule
out the possibility

18
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
that all these battles
were just diversions.

19
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,419
-OK, Lee.

20
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:50,787
I'm almost done.

21
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,191
I just have to reconnect
two or three more muscles.

22
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:56,492
INO (VOICEOVER):
Sakura's mastery

23
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:59,262
of medical ninjutsu is perfect.

24
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,130
But me?

25
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,865
I'm--

26
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,267
-Phew.

27
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,134
That's it.

28
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,869
The treatment's over for now.

29
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,504
You must have been
fighting like a maniac

30
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:10,773
to end up in such bad shape.

31
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:11,808
-Sorry.

32
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:13,443
But you saved my life.

33
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:16,245
Now I will be forever
in your debt, Sakura.

34
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,214
-I was just doing my job.

35
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:19,015
No!

36
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,316
You shouldn't get up yet.

37
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,286
As a medical ninja, I forbid
you from doing anymore fighting.

38
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,253
You need your rest.

39
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:24,987
-No.

40
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,389
Please let me go.

41
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,726
I cannot leave Gaara alone
out there fending for himself.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,196
I must repay the
favor he did for us.

43
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:42,738
-Gaara, you may very well be
called the ultimate weapon,

44
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,741
but unless I'm mistaken,
you used up all your chakra

45
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,876
in that earlier fight.

46
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,314
-This is all the weapon I need.

47
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:52,748
GAARA (VOICEOVER): He's right.

48
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:55,117
I drew on almost all
my chakra infused sand

49
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:57,386
to beat back his first attack.

50
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:58,921
Dammit.

51
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:02,225
-Think what you want, but I'm
still ready to take you on.

52
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:05,194
Sand or no sound,
I can handle you.

53
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,295
-Hmph.

54
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,865
Somehow a ninja without a
weapon doesn't scare me.

55
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:14,937
Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!

56
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,347
-Huh?

57
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,749
[shout]

58
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,017
-Fang Release!

59
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,952
Airborne Dark Sword!

60
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,763
A shinobi fighting
with his bare hands

61
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:43,266
is no match for a
mighty ninja tool

62
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,234
forged by the
Village of Artisans.

63
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,386
Dragon Eye, Fang
Release, Dark Sword!

64
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,862
Well, well.

65
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,997
Looks like you're
all out of chakra.

66
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:17,133
I'm told you have a
monster inside of you.

67
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,100
Isn't that so?

68
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,507
Well, it's about time you
unleash that Shukaku of yours.

69
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,795
-Hey, you doing OK?

70
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,129
-Gaara-sensei's in trouble.

71
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:47,997
-Yeah.

72
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:51,133
I figured that out.

73
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,036
Listen, find a safe
place somewhere and hdie.

74
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,237
-OK.

75
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,839
This could get ugly.

76
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,275
Even though Sakura treated
him, Gaara's still weak.

77
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,819
-It's the end of the line,
ultimate weapon of the Sand

78
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,854
Village.

79
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,122
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Not good.

80
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:14,223
-What are you waiting for?

81
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,858
Let loose with the Shukaku!

82
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,393
NARUTO: Hey, you!

83
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,762
Just back off!

84
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,497
And who might you be?

85
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:22,932
-I'll tell you who I am.

86
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,401
From here on out, I'm the
guy you're fighting with!

87
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,336
-You're getting it my way, boy.

88
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,104
Kujaku Hurricane!

89
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:36,445
-Dammit!

90
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,782
-Just keep watching,
Leaf Village ninja.

91
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,851
Soon the reign of the
five hidden villages

92
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,720
will be over, and
even more than that,

93
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,123
the time is approaching
when the Village of Artisans

94
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,291
shall complete its
ultimate ninja tool.

95
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,727
And when it does,
there will be no need

96
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,262
for shinobi to
even exist at all.

97
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:54,463
-You're crazy.

98
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,998
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,201
-The village of artisans
has proud weapons makers.

100
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,137
For years we've been
making ninja tools

101
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,407
as good as or better than
the five great nations.

102
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,043
In times of war,
however, our village

103
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:10,780
is always attacked, targeted
for fear our valuable ninja

104
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:13,082
tools would be used
by the other side.

105
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:14,917
You ninja of the
five great nations

106
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,752
have forgotten
that our handiwork

107
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,487
is what keeps you in power.

108
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,457
You to take our tools and
repay us with bloodshed.

109
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,226
And despite our
expertise, to survive,

110
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,928
our village has
been forced to bend

111
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:29,932
to the whims of the so-called
great hidden villages.

112
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:34,070
However, that era well end
today, and the first to all

113
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,738
will be the Leaf Village.

114
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:36,739
Fang Release, Dark Sword!

115
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,344
You can't keep
running away forever.

116
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,155
Like a bird of prey,
I'll strike you down!

117
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:58,796
What?

118
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,737
But how?

119
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,472
MATSURI (VOICEOVER):
Gaara-sensei.

120
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:14,477
He used the sand to
protect that Leaf ninja.

121
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,312
Wow.

122
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:20,750
-That sand dome is packed hard
with minerals from the ground.

123
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:25,087
Your pathetic attacks are
far too weak to break it.

124
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:30,392
I will defend him, if it
takes everything I've got.

125
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,361
-Gaara-sensei.

126
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,163
-Don't make me laugh!

127
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:36,732
You, the so-called
ultimate weapon,

128
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,268
would risk your very
existence protecting someone

129
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,770
like this nuisance?

130
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,738
You would use what
little chakra you

131
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,007
have left for the
sake of a friend?

132
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,275
Quite a choice.

133
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,010
And it's one that
will be your downfall!

134
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:58,254
-Gaara-sensei!

135
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:01,857
-Now that I've captured
you, the plan is complete.

136
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:02,858
-Damn him.

137
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,478
-Gaara!

138
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,313
-We've been contacted by someone
from the Village of Artisans.

139
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,182
Apparently we have
enemies there,

140
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,084
a mysterious group known
as the Four Celestials.

141
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:31,287
They've been doing
some illegal research,

142
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,222
attempting to recreate
their village's

143
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,758
legendary ultimate weapon.

144
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,861
Intelligence tells us the other
villagers discovered the plan

145
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,996
and evacuated for
their own safety.

146
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,164
-I see.

147
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:45,301
That explains their village
being completely empty.

148
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,905
So this ultimate
weapon, what is it?

149
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:53,175
-The revival of Seimei, the
founder of their village.

150
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,443
-Seimei?

151
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:58,113
Are you saying they're actually
trying to raise the dead?

152
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,415
Of course.

153
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:02,084
That must be why we
found his tomb damaged.

154
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:05,020
-For our security, we must
stop this ultimate weapon

155
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,756
from being restored
at all costs.

156
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,091
-I understand.

157
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,326
Ma'am.

158
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,093
-Wait.

159
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,228
One more thing.

160
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,762
-Yes?

161
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:16,232
-I'm sending along someone to
accompany you on the mission.

162
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,233
-Huh?

163
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,167
Who might that be?

164
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,773
-Heh, heh, heh.

165
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,443
At last we will have
your Shukaku chakra.

166
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:29,845
-What did you say?

167
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,748
-It's what we've been
after this whole time.

168
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:35,451
Go ahead, Gaara, unleash
the force of Shukaku,

169
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:38,420
so that I can be
infused with its chakra.

170
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,955
NARUTO: Gaara!

171
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,157
Don't worry, I'm coming!

172
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:42,758
-Naruto!

173
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,763
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
Matsuri, take this.

174
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,369
-My rope javelin?

175
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:09,151
GAARA: The optic
nerve is connected.

176
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:11,253
Third eye, open.

177
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:16,992
-Hey!

178
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,460
Buddy!

179
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:19,929
What's the meaning of all this?

180
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,263
What are you up to?

181
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,032
-Don't worry, you'll see.

182
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,068
Long ago, the great founder
of our village, Lord Seimei,

183
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,404
began creating the
ultimate ninja tool.

184
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,041
-You're doing all
this for a weapon?

185
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,376
-And now it will
finally be completed.

186
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,687
Ha!

187
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,888
[groan]

188
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:54,931
-Gaara!

189
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,517
-Oh mighty Lord
Seimei, may your spirit

190
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,954
come and be joined with my
flesh to complete your revival!

191
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,962
[shout]

192
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:39,908
[scream]

193
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,653
-What the-- he just vanished.

194
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:01,505
What?

195
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:05,041
That guy came back to life.

196
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:10,914
-I am called Seimei, founder
of the Village of Artisans.

197
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:13,917
And now, after 100
years of slumber,

198
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,853
I have been awakened as my
village's ultimate tool.

199
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:26,730
-It's so bright!

200
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,832
What the heck is going on?

201
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:32,669
[laughter]

202
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:41,144
-I have waited so long for this.

203
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:44,047
For my plans to
come to fruition.

204
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,183
Now the Village of
Artisans will rule

205
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,653
over all other shinobi lands.

206
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,488
Oh, I see.

207
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,056
The monster from
the Sand Village

208
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:56,026
has become the source
of my renewed energy.

209
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,627
-What are you saying?

210
00:13:57,661 --> 00:14:00,230
-It is just as Hogyo predicted.

211
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,566
Lying dormant within
the body of the one

212
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,169
called Gaara of the Desert
is a monster, and once caged,

213
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:08,471
he will transform
into the beast,

214
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:12,142
releasing his awesome Shukaku.

215
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,778
My body will be fueled
by the Shukuaku chakra,

216
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:18,114
and I will obtain
infinite power.

217
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,217
-No way I'm gonna
let that happen!

218
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,652
Get ready, 'cause here I come!

219
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:48,044
That bastard.

220
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:57,120
Keep holding on, Gaara.

221
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:58,922
'Cause I'm going
to break you out.

222
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,494
-What a waste of breath.

223
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:05,495
Dashing Wind.

224
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:13,837
-You want some?

225
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,838
-Such a fool.

226
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,046
-Hang on.

227
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,615
I'm getting you out of there!

228
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,052
Come on, come on!

229
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:30,520
Don't give up, Gaara!

230
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:32,923
Keep listening to the
sound of my voice!

231
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,591
Come on, answer me!

232
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,927
What's goin' on down there?

233
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,528
Gaara!

234
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,897
Gaara!

235
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:44,501
[groan]

236
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:48,471
-Naruto.

237
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,059
-Hey, Shikamaru.

238
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,226
-So what's the word?

239
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,163
-We do not know Naruto
and Gaara's location.

240
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:16,833
-Neji, Hinata, look ahead and
tell me what the situation is.

241
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,637
-There's a large metal cage in
the middle of an open canyon.

242
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:23,807
And I sense a massive amount of
chakra being extracted from it.

243
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,509
-All that energy could
mean Gaara's inside.

244
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,479
-Hey, Shikamaru.

245
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,780
-Yeah, what's up?

246
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:33,616
-You are aware that Gaara
has a terrifying power lying

247
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,518
dormant within his
body, aren't you?

248
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:36,653
-Yeah, sorta.

249
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:37,921
I know about it.

250
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,857
-I'm worried about his chakra
being extracted like this.

251
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,727
He might not be able
to contain the power.

252
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,962
Something truly
horrible could happen.

253
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:48,965
If he loses control, the
Shukaku could be released.

254
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,635
And when it goes berserk, there
would be no way to stop Gaara.

255
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,604
-What a drag.

256
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:57,173
-I have wasted too
much time on you.

257
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,809
This game was entertaining,
but it ends now.

258
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,184
-Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot!

259
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,252
I hate this guy.

260
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:14,824
I'll rescue you, Gaara!

261
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,159
-What a little pest.

262
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,495
You have no chance, so give up.

263
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:25,635
Now to end this.

264
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:34,244
Solid Blanks.

265
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:54,164
[laughter]

266
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:59,769
-Ah, how I have longed for
this moment to finally arrive.

267
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,604
Wash over me, Shukaku.

268
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,106
Let me drink your power.

269
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,716
I feel the power.

270
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,018
It's absolutely incredible!

271
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:20,557
[groan]

272
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:33,411
-Ah?

273
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,110
-Why don't give up, boy?

274
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:43,980
The power of the
Shukaku is already mine.

275
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:47,050
Now I declare war on
the five great nations,

276
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,053
and against every single
ninja of those lands who

277
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,589
took advantage of the
Village of Artisans.

278
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,491
They will suffer
the consequences

279
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:57,927
of the hundred year grudge
held by my proud people.

280
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:01,598
For they will all be sacrificed
as we seek our revenge.

281
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,032
-You shut your mouth!

282
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,033
-Huh?

283
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,902
-If you think we're
just going to let

284
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:09,639
you use our own power against
us, you're dead wrong!

285
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,642
I hope you got a good
taste of Gaara's chakra,

286
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,043
'cause you're about
to give it back!

287
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:17,580
You got that?

288
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,750
-He must be in pain, so
how can that boy continue

289
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:23,520
to fight despite
all his injuries?

290
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,487
-I'm curious.

291
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:26,256
Why are you still trying to win?

292
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,192
Why is that monster of
the Sand Village worth

293
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:31,060
putting your own
life on the line?

294
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:34,030
-I'll tell ya why.

295
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:38,168
'Cause Gaara's my friends,
and my friends are important.

296
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:41,504
-He told me he would
fight to the end for those

297
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:44,174
who are important to him.

298
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:46,910
-He's fighting for
someone important.

299
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,046
For his friend.

300
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:51,548
-Very well, then.

301
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:52,715
Die for your friend.

302
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,526
-Huh?

303
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,029
-What do you think
you're doing, girl?

304
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,130
-I get it now.

305
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,798
I've figured out
what Gaara-sensei

306
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,133
was trying to teach me.

307
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,636
Maybe weapons took the lives
of my mother and father.

308
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:15,638
However, you can
also use a weapon

309
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,942
to protect those close to you.

310
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:19,909
-Utter nonsense.

311
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:30,553
-You jerk!

312
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,894
-The transformation's begun.

313
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:52,875
-What's happened to him?

314
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,216
[groan]

315
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,251
-Huh?

316
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:02,486
Gaara!

317
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,692
[groan]

318
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:21,237
-Is that you?

319
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:24,807
[groan]

320
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:33,549
[theme music]

321
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:03,539
SHIKAMARU: Hey, is that--

322
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,607
TEMARI: This is bad.

323
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,642
If Gaara loses
consciousness in that state,

324
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,578
the Shukaku will emerge
and completely take

325
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:09,912
control of his body.

326
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:12,081
If that happens, it
won't matter anymore

327
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,950

00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:23,659

NARUTO: Next time, Departure.
