What is wrong with you?

That medicine he took.

Could there have been some

All your training
has not been in vain!

Hey.

Come on.

What's the hold up, tough guy?

KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): These
movements-- what are they?

GUY: I'm sure there's no
need to tell you this,

but that Kenpo brand is no joke.

back, the stronger it gets!

-Yes, I know.

00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:31,501
One time in this
restaurant, Lee thought

80
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,667
he was reaching for some
water and he ended up

81
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,267
downing a small
cup of Dragon Fire.

00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,567
Get his legs.

Thank goodness I
had Neji with me..

96
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,767
It took the two of us combined
to finally restrain him.

97
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,101
-You mean you couldn't
overpower him on your own?

98
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,067
-Well, if he had
actually been my enemy,

99
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,201
I could've taken
him down no problem.

100
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:08,567
But Lee's special to me.

101
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:12,234
I could never hurt
a hair on his head.

102
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,001
-Of course.

103
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:17,501
-That's how bad it got
after he had one sip.

104
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:22,001
If he were to treat an
entire bottle of that sake--

105
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:25,634
-He might be
virtually invincible.

106
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,434
But he's just out
of the hospital.

107
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,101
How long will his body hold out?

108
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:41,267
-Hey, come on.

109
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:43,967
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): He's
using the Drunken Fist.

00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,867
I've never seen it before.

111
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,301
-If you will not
make the first move,

112
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,567
then I will just have to
bring the fight to you!

[shout]

114
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:58,434

of attack is fairly direct.

115
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,434
-Agh!

116
00:09:59,467 --> 00:09:59,934
Ugh.

00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,067
Ow.

118
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,134
What'd you do that for?

119
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:27,101
I am enjoying the
springtime of my youth!

120
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,901
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): His
moves are so unorthodox.

121
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,634
But more than
anything he's fast!

122
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:41,101
-I am in the prime of my youth
and making the most of it.

KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): I
can't read his movements.

131
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:50,418
For him to land an attack on me?

132
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:51,584
That's quite the taijutsu.

133
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:55,818
No other choice.

134
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:11,584
-My true abilities
lie within my bones.

135
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,351
I'm sure the little
clone brat must

136
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,218
have told you before he left.

137
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,118
-Huh?

138
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,118
-I think it's time
we sobered you up.

139
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:21,451
-Sober who up?

140
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:25,318
Do I look drunk to you?

141
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:30,251
-Well, whatever you are,
I'll snap you out it.

142
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:33,218
-I said I'm not drunk.

143
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,751
In the first place,
I'm not even of age.

144
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:39,718
Underage ninjas should not
partake in drinking sake!

145
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:43,184
-Gah!

146
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:57,251
-Unorthodox is it not?

147
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,618
This is my kekkei genkai.

148
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,318
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER):
Calm down, Shikamaru.

149
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,284
Figure out a strategy.

150
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,851
There's got to be
some way out of this.

151
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,518
[chuckling] He wasn't
able to scamper off

152
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,484
too far with that wound of his.

153
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,184
KIBA (VOICEOVER): That' it.

154
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:01,718
I can't go any further.

155
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,751
Are you kidding me?

156
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,618
He's already caught up?

00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,318
[sniff]

158
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,218
KIBA (VOICEOVER): Wait.

159
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:39,984
-My head is pounding
like a drum.

160
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,951
And why is my face bleeding?

161
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:47,184
It seems I really was
drunk after all then.

162
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:50,184
Uh-- what has happened to you?

163
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:53,684
-So, your medicine
has finally worn off.

164
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,251
You're looking at
my kekkei genkai.

165
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,051
LEE: Kekkei genkai.

166
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:05,351
-My kekkei genkai freely
controls my osteoblasts

167
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,318
and osteoclasts.

168
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,951
It allows me to alter the
concentration of calcium

169
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:13,651
and form new bones altogether.

170
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:18,684
Normally, the human
body contains 206 bones.

171
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,884
But in my case, that number
is somewhat more negotiable.

172
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:32,951
-But bone is bone after all.

173
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,384
Once broken, there
is no mending it!

174
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:43,918
LEE (VOICEOVER): Such density.

175
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:46,818
Are those really human bones?

176
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:50,318
Hyah!

177
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:53,584
Very well.

178
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,518
-Behold, my Larch Dance.

179
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:02,418
-Gyah!

180
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:21,684
[groaning]

181
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,784
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
I've had it.

182
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:28,218
-Just a little bit further,
you piece of garbage.

183
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,784
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): This is
just like that time with Asuma.

184
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,884
-Asuma.

185
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,918
-The chances of
someone stepping into

186
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:55,018
help me here are
probably close to zero.

187
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:58,584
Stop wasting brainpower on
something that'll never happen.

188
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,684
Just calm down.

189
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:53,884
[sniffing]

190
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,851
KIBA (VOICEOVER): His
scent-- he's moving away.

191
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:00,918
-That was close.

192
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:01,584
SAKON: What was?

193
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:07,984
-But how did you?

194
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:10,084
-I knew that it would work.

195
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:12,418
[chuckling]

196
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,284
KIMIMARO (VOICEOVER): My jacket.

197
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:16,584
-You're so used
to your own smell

198
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:19,818
you didn't even
notice it on the wind.

199
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:22,251
-So you were skulking
around in my jacket

200
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,351
to cover up your scent.

201
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,784
You seem to know a
lot about tracking.

202
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,884
No wonder I couldn't smell you.

203
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,684
Guess I shouldn't
be surprised, right?

204
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:34,084
Seriously.

205
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,451
How in the world am I supposed
to keep track of somebody who

206
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,184
can split in half?

207
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,651
Well, come on then.

208
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:54,084
-Please, wait.

209
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:55,951
From now on.

210
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,051
We play for keeps.

211
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,984
LEE (VOICEOVER): My
role now is to stall

212
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,084
this person as long as possible.

213
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:08,151
I would rather not resort
to more powerful attacks.

214
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,484
They will only leave me
vulnerable to defeat.

215
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:13,218
But my enemy is
a formidable one.

216
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,651
I will have to reveal my
secret technique to best him!

217
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,084
-Here I come.

218
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,518
I just had surgery, so
I am not at my best.

219
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:28,218
But if I only open the First
Gate, the Gate of Opening,

220
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,618
I should be all right.

221
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:36,418
-The First Gate, Gate
of Opening, open!

222
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:41,784
Primary Lotus!

223
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:52,118
LEE (VOICEOVER): The bone
absorbed the impact of my kick!

224
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:55,284
-Your speed is impressive.

225
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,084
But this is over now.

226
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,484
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

227
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:03,818
I'm wracking my brain here, Why
can't I come up with anything?

228
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:05,318
I'm at the end of my rope.

229
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,351
I can't hold on any home longer.

230
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,551
-You're staring
death in the face.

231
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:15,451
Shouldn't you be screaming
for mercy or something?

232
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:16,951
Eh?

233
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,451
[chuckling]

234
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,851
-Now die!

235
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,184
-You're mine!

236
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,851
-You're gonna die, kid.

237
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:28,818
Wipe that grin off your face!

238
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:37,484
[scream]

239
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,351
-What the hell?

240
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:47,451
-Who are you?

241
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,284
-Huh?

242
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,784
-Heh.

243
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:55,784
Well, what do you know?

244
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:57,184
Looks like we're
on the same side.

245
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,784
-Who are you?

246
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,551
-Allies of the Leaf Village.

247
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,484
-We're shinobi of the Sand.

248
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,996
[theme music]

249
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:04,838
SHKAMARU: I had heard that
the Sand and Leaf had made up,

250
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:06,038
but--

251
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:07,438
TEMARI: It's not like we
attacked the Leaf Village

252
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,438
for the heck of it.

253
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,704
It was a mission,
just like this is.

254
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:12,238
SHIKAMARU: Whatever
you say well.

255
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,238
KIBA: Hey, by the way,
weren't there three of you

256
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,938
Sand ninja heading
this way before?

257
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:19,438
KANKURO: We had no choice but
to split up for you weaklings.

258
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:20,138
KIBA: You idiot.

259
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,838
Don't take them lightly.

260
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:24,338
These guys are
anything but ordinary.

261
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,471
NARUTO: Next time--
the Sand Shinobi!

262
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,371
Allies of the Leaf!

263
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:32,904
