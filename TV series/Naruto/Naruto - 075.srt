[singing in japanese]

3
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:53,062
GAARA: Are you shocked
by my true form?

4
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,595
Come out, come
out, Sasuke Uchiha.

5
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,462
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke's
decision, pushed to the edge!

6
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:19,762
-So there you are.

7
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:28,462
-Guess again.

8
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,295
-Here, you can have them back.

9
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:04,262
Only a clone.

10
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:11,229
-This guy's a freak.

11
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,629
What's wrong, Sasuke Uchiha?

12
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,395
Why do you run and hide?

13
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:22,429
Why don't you attack?

14
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:38,362
[screaming in pain] Why
do you always run away?

15
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,762
-Yeah, good kick.

16
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,195
-Yeah, it's to me.

17
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,495
-No, it's to me.

18
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:45,229
-Yeah, get it.

19
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,929
-Come on, you can do it.

20
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:47,562
Get it.

21
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,362
-That was awesome.

22
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,295
-Pass it, pass it.

23
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,262
-Get in there, come on.

24
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:55,329
-Here we go man.

25
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:57,529
-Here we go, come
on, we're real close.

26
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,962
-Look, look, he's open
you've got a chance.

27
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:03,862
Come on, come on,
shoot it, come on.

28
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:04,829
-Corner shot!

29
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:14,229
-Oh man now what do we do?

30
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:17,729
I don't know any
wall-climbing jutsu, do you?

31
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:18,195
Huh?

32
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:28,795
It's him.

33
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,895
-Here.

34
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,095
-It's that Gaara.

35
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,629
He's really creepy.

36
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:46,095
Run!

37
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:46,795
-Hurry!

38
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,595
-Let's get out of here!

39
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:54,829
-No, wait, don't run away.

40
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,295
-Help me!

41
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,229
-Something's got a hold of me.

42
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:06,062
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Please, I
don't want to be alone anymore.

43
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,495
-Ah, let me go!

44
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,862
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Never again.

45
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:16,795
-Stop it, please!

46
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:25,895
-No, Gaara, you can't do this.

47
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:26,395
-Yashamaru.

48
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,762
I won't let you get away.

49
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,262
You can't escape, do you hear?

50
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:08,829
Sasuke Uchiha.

51
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:30,429
[laughing manically]

52
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:31,929
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
This is unreal.

53
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,662
His strength is off the charts.

54
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,162
-What's wrong?

55
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,529
You're not afraid
of me, are you?

56
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,129
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
If this comes down

57
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,729
to physical strength, forget it.

58
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,662
-Yes, that's it.

59
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,129
You fear me.

60
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,562
Don't you, Uchiha?

61
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:50,929
You live in fear
every day I'm alive!

62
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,929
Never forget-- you are my prey.

63
00:06:58,695 --> 00:06:59,162
-Hold on.

64
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:03,762
Why me?

65
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,262
Why are you so fixated on me?

66
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:16,929
-I see in your eyes you
know what loneliness is.

67
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,195
True loneliness.

68
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,195
You understand that it
is the most painful form

69
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,162
of suffering that
there is in the world.

70
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:33,462
As I said before, we
have the same eyes--

71
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:43,295
eyes with a hunger for power,
full of hate-- the same as me.

72
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:48,562
Eyes that seek revenge against
those who made you so lonely.

73
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:50,229
Eyes that burn to
see them all dead.

74
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,429
It's all in your eyes.

75
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:10,729
-OK, hang on a minute here.

76
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:14,995
So you're the one called Gaara.

77
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,095
Seems you can read a
lot in Sasuke's eyes.

78
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,529
Be careful-- you may
not be able to read him

79
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:22,929
as well as you think.

80
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,329
If there's something you wanted
say before the final rounds,

81
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:29,795
go ahead and spit it out.

82
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,195
When we finally
fight, it won't be

83
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,529
to advance to the
next stage, but solely

84
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:43,295
for survival-- one seeking
to destroy the other.

85
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:45,695
Only the last one
standing will feel

86
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,329
the full value of his existence.

87
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,862
-You're not talking
about a match.

88
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,929
You're talking about some kind
of grudge bout to the death.

89
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,262
It's crazy.

90
00:08:54,295 --> 00:09:00,062
-Uchiha, in the depths of your
soul-- it's what you want,

91
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,429
too, isn't it?

92
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:05,895
You want to confirm the value
of your existence, don't you?

93
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:09,862
To know if you are truly as
powerful as you think you are.

94
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:14,029
Whose existence is
stronger-- yours, or the ones

95
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,262
facing you with
murder in his eyes?

96
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:37,129
What's wrong?

97
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,729
Sasuke Uchiha?

98
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,495
Are you really so afraid of me?

99
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,395
Has all your hatred
and sense of purpose

100
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:51,762
dwindled down to
this-- abject fear?

101
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:56,295
Is this the existence you
live now-- that of a coward?

102
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,962
Come out and fight me.

103
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,929
Show me that I'm wrong.

104
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:04,762
Prove that your existence
is stronger than mine.

105
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:07,295
You'll never know
unless you fight the.

106
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,995
You'll never feel it!

107
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:10,495
Attack!

108
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,862
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He
killed everyone but me.

109
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,329
I was the only one
allowed to live.

110
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,529
For what reason?

111
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,495
I know the reason.

112
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,429
He had to leave one
alive to spare himself

113
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:42,462
the guilt of having
exterminated an entire clan.

114
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:51,162
By sparing me, Itachi chose me
to be the avenger of the clan.

115
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:53,795
He chose me to be
the one to kill him.

116
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,095
-Good.

117
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,095
Now we're going to have
some fun, Sasuke Uchiha!

118
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:20,029
-With one blow,
I'll finish this.

119
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:07,039
Hurry up and die, you
withered old buzzard.

120
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:10,539
Put yourself out of your misery.

121
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:15,406
-I told you before,
we will both die here.

122
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:15,906
Fool!

123
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,306
-You'll never do it.

124
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,539
Let it go!

125
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:31,173
-No, I will not
let go until I've

126
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:33,073
pulled your wretched
soul from your body.

127
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:47,239
Not much time--

128
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:20,139
-[scream]

129
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:20,639
-Gaara!

130
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,273
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Looks like it worked.

131
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:41,606
-[laughing]

132
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,573
-I see.

133
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,406
So that's what it is.

134
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:57,406
-Amazing.

135
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,039
After all Uchiha
has been through,

136
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,873
he was still able to
counter Gaara's attack.

137
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:09,439
-Now it's clear
to me exactly why

138
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:14,806
I've been looking forward
to this, this pain.

139
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,539
What a thrill it will be
to crush such as opponent

140
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:21,239
capable of wounding me so badly.

141
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:26,873
Such a victory will make me feel
what it is to be truly alive!

142
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:30,073
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): No one
has ever wounded Gaara--

143
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,173
and he's done it twice.

144
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:37,273
He's a freak of
nature, like Gaara.

145
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:41,806
But this one is a freak
in fiber of his body.

146
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,273
For all Gaara's
strength, it's only

147
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,173
his right arm that's
been transformed.

148
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,639
-There's more, so much more.

149
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:54,139
-What the--

150
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,939
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What
the hell is this guy?

151
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,906
How many of these things are
going to grow out of him?

152
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,839
He's even faster.

153
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:34,806
Only by predicting his moves
do I have any chance of dying.

154
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,739
Without my [inaudible]
I'd be dead already.

155
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:45,206
Use my Chidori, Fire
style, fireball Jutsu!

156
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,406
-[laugh]

157
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,439
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): It
didn't even slow him down.

158
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:59,873
This level of Jutsu is useless.

159
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,806
-You're finished.

160
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,773
-It's Chidori, or nothing.

161
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:30,973
-So, looks like you're
good for two bursts.

162
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:31,973
That's about your limit.

163
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,373
At this stage of your
chakra development,

164
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:46,539
you've only got two shots
of Chidori in you per day.

165
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,306
And you weren't
using your Sharingan,

166
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,373
which you would be
in an actual battle.

167
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:56,673
Sharingon and Chidor are a
potent combination, but costly.

168
00:16:56,706 --> 00:17:01,139
Using them simultaneously burns
up a lot of chakra, and fast.

169
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:09,673
Don't sweat it.

170
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:11,873
I'm actually very impressed.

171
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,239
Even for me,
Chidori is a killer.

172
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:17,973
If I had to use the lightning
blade four times in one day,

173
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,473
I'd be running on empty.

174
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:27,606
What would happen if I tried
to use it more than twice?

175
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:34,473
-Well, for one thing,
it wouldn't work.

176
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:39,373
But remember this-- if you try
to force a Jutsu, not only will

177
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,906
it not work, but the
attempt can drain

178
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,939
your chakra to absolute zero.

179
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:47,039
Worst case scenario, you die.

180
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,573
Even if the worst
doesn't happen,

181
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,706
nothing good can come of it.

182
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,939
Trust me-- especially
in your case.

183
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,673
-Is that it?

184
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:11,339
That was the best
demonstration you

185
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,373
could make of the value
of your existence?

186
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:17,406
That's just pathetic, truly.

187
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:23,073
Your hatred.

188
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:24,539
It's weak.

189
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,406
You are far too
soft and forgiving.

190
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:33,539
The greater the hunger for
revenge, the greater, the hate.

191
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:36,706
And it's the power of hate that
gives you the strength to kill.

192
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:47,806
Your hate is weaker
than mine, far weaker.

193
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,306
-Shut up.

194
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,973
-You know what that
means, don't you?

195
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,639
-Just shut up.

196
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:58,673
-It means you can't win.

197
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:01,139
You are weaker than I am.

198
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:05,873
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
There's a reason

199
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:10,406
Itachi let me live, a reason
he chose me to be the one

200
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:13,139
to track him down and kill him.

201
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:15,106
I am an avenger!

202
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,373
-[groaning]

203
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,639
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
The curse mark again.

204
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,839
Can't move my body!

205
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:03,739
-Sasuke!

GAARA (VOICEOVER): Tell me,
Yashamaru, what is pain?

208
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,066
I've never been injured,
so I don't know.

209
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:22,266
But now, I'm wondering if
this is pain, this feeling.

210
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,466
Am I injured?

211
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:28,033
I'm not bleeding but there's
a strange feeling here

212
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:34,099
in my chest, pulsing, like
something bad wants to get out.

213
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,966
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
Assassin of the Moonlit Night.
