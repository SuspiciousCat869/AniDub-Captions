-Naruto is not here.

Looks like he was
out all night again.

-He's gone completely crazy.

17

He's out climbing
trees in the dark.

18
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,510
He could be dead
by now, you know,

from using up too
much of his chakra.

Naruto is a goofy kid, but
he's also a full-fledged ninja.

He can handle himself.

Naruto is such a loser.

He's probably lying out
there dead somewhere.

You know, what are you

-Yes, that's right.

They're for treating

So are you a ninja?

56
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,365
Because I noticed that
headband you're wearing.

57
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:48,635
Or are you just making
a fashion statement?

58

-You noticed that?

59

All right!

00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,239
Only super-cool

Isn't that enough?

-No, no.

00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:12,626
I need to get
stronger and stronger.

I have to keep practicing.

-Oh, so why is it so important?

74
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:21,202
-So I could become the
best ninja in my village.

75
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,170
And everyone will know who I am.

And they'll all respect me.

that I have to
prove something to.

for this certain person?

something precious that they

become genuinely strong.

it'll be a miracle.

-Naruto.

174
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,387
Humph.

175
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,755
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

176
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,831
-You're recovering quickly.

-Yes.

181
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:37,871
-Let's go back.

182
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,038
-All right.

183
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,879
-Now, they're both late.

184
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,314
I wouldn't have expected
that from Sasuke.

185
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:49,883
[door opens]

186
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,954
-What have you been up to?

187
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,424
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

188
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:58,692
-[chuckles]

189
00:12:58,725 --> 00:12:59,826
We both made it.

190
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:03,130
We climbed all the
way to the top.

191
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:05,365
-Good.

192
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,666
Now, we move on.

193
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,970
Starting tomorrow, you're
both bodyguards for Tazuna.

194
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:12,106
-[laughs] All right!

195
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,875
-Ugh, you are such a loser.

196
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:18,278
[laughter]

197
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:22,082
-In a few more days, the
bridge will be finished.

198
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:23,751
I have you to thank for that.

199
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:24,885
-You've all done great.

200
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,355
But you've still
got to be careful.

201
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:28,923
-I've been meaning
to ask you this,

202
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,559
but I haven't had
the chance until now.

203
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,762
Why did you stay and protect
me even after you found out

204
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,531
I lied to bring you here?

-"Those who stray from the path
of justice have no courage.

206

But under the wing
of a strong leader,

207
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:45,540
cowardice cannot survive."

208
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,209
-Huh?

209
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:51,680
-That was a quote
from the First Hokage.

210
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:52,280
-Hm.

214

If you care about
something, keep trying.

215
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,111
Protect it with both arms.

216
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,050
Inari, don't cry.

217
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,297
-But why?

218
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,664
-Hm?

219
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,633
What did you say?

220
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,967
-Ungh.

221
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:48,138
All this stupid training
is just a waste of time.

222
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,472
Gato's got a whole army.

223
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,509
They'll beat you down,
and they'll destroy you!

224
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:56,613
These cool things you all
say, they don't mean anything.

225
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,282
No matter what you do,
the strong always win

226
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,218
and the weak always lose.

227
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,359
-Just speak for yourself.

228
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:10,093
It won't be like that for me.

229
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:10,994
You got that?

230
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:12,129
-Why don't you be quiet?

231
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,897
Just looking at
you makes me sick!

232
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:16,033
You don't know anything
about this country.

233
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,368
You're just butting in!

234
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,570
Always laughing
and playing around.

235
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:21,305
You don't know what
it's like to suffer

236
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,976
and be treated like dirt!

237
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,878
-Listen to yourself
whining and complaining

238
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:29,681
like some sorry little victim!

239
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:30,915
-Uhh.

240
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:33,652
-You can whimper all
day for all I care.

241

You're nothing but a coward.

-Hm!

243
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:39,524
-Naruto, you went too far!

KAKASHI: Can I talk to you?

248
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:21,901
Naruto can be a little
harsh sometimes.

249
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,369
But he doesn't hate you.

250
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,377
Your grandfather told us
what happened to your father.

251
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:35,015
You probably don't know
this, but Naruto also

252
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:37,250
grew up without a father.

253
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:40,587
In fact, he never knew
either of his parents.

254
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:43,389
And he didn't have a single
friend in our village.

255
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:45,058
-Huh?

256
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:51,097
-Still, I've never seen
him cry, sulk, or give up.

257
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:54,368
He's always eager to jump in.

258
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,803
He wants to be respected.

259
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,405
That's his dream.

260
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:03,244
And he'll put his life on the
line for that-- in a heartbeat.

261
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:06,647
My guess is he just
got tired of crying

262
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,416
and decided to do
something about it.

263
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,785
-Oh.

264
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:11,385
Hm.

265
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:17,391
-Even though he's young
and still learning,

266
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:23,998
he knows what it means to be
strong, like your father did.

267
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,934
I think he knows better
than any of us what

268
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,936
you are going through.

269
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,405
-Oh.

270
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:35,043
-What Naruto told you earlier,
as cruel as it sounded,

271
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:38,518
he's probably told
himself that 1,000 times.

272
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:55,163
OK, I leave Naruto
in your hands.

273
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,300
He's pushed his
body to the limit.

274
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,167
Overdoing it, as usual.

275
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,405
So he may not be able
to move today at all.

You are still
recovering yourself.

-Why?

00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:07,210
Do I look wobbly?

I'll be OK.

licking your wounds?

I hired you to do
a job, you know!

Are you listening, Zabuza?

338
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:49,605
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before you idealize.

339
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,975
Motivate your anger,
make them all realize.

340
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:56,279
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

341
00:21:56,312 --> 00:22:00,050
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

342
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,689
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

343
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:09,659
Sneaking out of the
classroom, by the backdoor.

344
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:13,563
A man railed at me twice,
though, but I didn't care.

345
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:17,200
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

346
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:20,170
Don't try to live so wise.

347
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:23,907
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

348
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,044
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

349
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,614
will hate yourself in the end.

350
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,294
Don't try to live so wise.

351
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:46,664
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

352
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,168
Don't try with fakes
or fears 'cause you

353
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,538
will hate yourself in the end.

354
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,874
Don't try to live so wise.

355
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,445
Don't cry 'cause
you're so right.

356
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,614
Don't try with fakes--

357
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,286
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
OK, so I slept late.

358
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,189
Don't think I'm going to miss
the action because of that.

359
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,658
Whoa, Inari, look at you!

360
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:15,293
You're getting brave, partner.

361
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,063
Well, your dad was a big hero.

362
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,165
So maybe it's your turn now.

363
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,433
Wait a minute.

364
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,835
What about Kakashi-sensei
and the others?

365
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,871
If they're in danger, I've
got to get over there!

366
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,975
Next time, "Haku's Secret
Jutsu-- Crystal Ice Mirrors."

367
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:34,708
To survive this one, I'll have
to kick butt like never before!
