00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,873
Over here.

5
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:49,175
What's your name?

6
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,678
-I'm not obliged to answer.

7
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,647
-What's that?

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,582
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
[giggles] Cute.

-Heh.

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,125
So that's the bunch of
misfits that Kakashi and Guy

11
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,661
have been going on about.

12
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,664
I guess they passed
their first test,

13
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:07,967
getting their
applications through.

14

-Right.

It looks like the exams
are gonna be fun this year.

-Yeah, for us, but
maybe not for them.

Don't pull me, Sakura.

-He's pretty bold.

24

You gonna challenge him?

We're supposed to check in.

-I will catch up
with you in a minute.

You do not need to wait for me.

I just want to check something.

My name is Rock Lee.

47
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,496
You said it was common
currency for a challenger

48
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:50,433
to give his own
name first, right?

49
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:52,268

50
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:53,236
-Hm.

51
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,841
So you know me.

52
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,377
I challenge you.

53
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,115
Everyone is always talking
about the Uchiha clan

54
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:03,317
and how great they are.

55
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,252
I want to see if it is true.

56
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:08,256
I figure you will be
a good test for me.

57
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,626
And also--

-You are an angel,
sent from heaven.

-Yaaaahahhhh!

Whoa!

let us see you dodge this.

Keep your creepy little
valentines to yourself!

77

I was dodging for my life there!

-You do not have to be
so negative, Sakura.

wants to fight Sasuke?

It's always Sasuke!

-You've heard of
the Uchiha Clan,

83
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:17,479
yet you're challenging me?

84
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:20,217
You must be even more
psycho than you look,

85

if that's possible.

86

You want to know
more about my clan,

87
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:28,393
then I'll teach
you-- the hard way.

-Bring it on.

A match-up against
the number-one rookie.

91

I will draw him out and get
him to reveal his technique,

to you, Guy Sensei.

It'll take me two
minutes to have

-No thank you.

103

Right now the only one I
want to fight is Uchiha.

104
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,808
-Yeah?

105
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,377
Well, I've got news for you!

106
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,379
Sasuke can't compare to me!

107
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:10,983
Believe it!

108
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:11,583
Yaahhh!

He's better than he looks.

116
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,354
-Just accept it.

117
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:41,589
You have no chance against me.

118
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,358
Your skills are inferior.

119
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,492
You see, Sasuke.

-Out of all the top Leaf
Genin, I am the best.

122
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,767
Fight me and I will
prove it to you.

123
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:58,845
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
He stopped my kick.

124
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,281
That's some chakra
he's got on his arm.

125
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,186
-Hmm.

126
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,488
This'll be fun.

127
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:09,559
Let's do it.

[gasp]

129
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,232
-There's no time, Sasuke.

130
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,535
We've got to register
by three o'clock.

131
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,972
That's less than half an hour.

132
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:20,940
-Relax.

133
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,813
This'll all be over
in five seconds.

134
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,548
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
Here he comes.

135
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,117
Forgive me, Guy Sensei.

136
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,389
I know it is forbidden, but
I may have to break the rules

137
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:35,393
and use that jutsu!

138
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:38,362
-Unh!

139
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:41,734
-Leaf Hurricane!

140
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,703
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I'm
not moving fast enough.

141
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:47,274
I've got to block him.

142
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,242
What?

143
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,211
-Aaaah!

144
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:51,113
-Sasuke!

145
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:51,714
-Unh!

146
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:02,027
-[grunts] What's going on?

147
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,796
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
He had his guard up,

148
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,934
and Lee went right through it.

149
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:10,504
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He's using
some technique to get to me.

150
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:11,506
But what is it?

151
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,843
A ninjutsu or a genjutsu?

152
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,445
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER):
As I expected,

153
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,413
he is coming back for more.

154
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,415
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Hm.

155
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,384
OK, this is good.

156
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,354
Got him right where I want him.

157
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,723
Now's my chance.

158
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:26,993
-I've been waiting
to try this out.

159
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,001
[gasp]

160
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,970
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Could it be?

161
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:38,541
Is it-- the Sharingan!

162
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:41,879
When did he learn to-- his eyes!

163
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:45,850
It's in both of them.

164
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:48,020
ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): So
that is the Sharingan.

165
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:57,700
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): You never
know what Sasuke'll do next.

166
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,967
He's amazing!

167
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,438
If it's like Kakashi
Sensei's Sharingan,

168
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:05,810
he'll be able to read this
guy's jutsu and nail him!

169
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,879
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Genjutsu or ninjutsu--

170
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:11,484
whatever magic he's
using, I'll see it now.

171
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,291
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke's
getting stronger every day!

172
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:25,035
Just what'd you'd
expect from an Uchiha.

173
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:30,508
Sasuke could never lose to
a guy like this. no way!

174
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:31,109
-Aaaugh!

175
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:34,447
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What?

176
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,386
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): Nngh!

177
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,722
He got around my guard.

178
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:41,890
But how?

179
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,561
What kind of jutsu is that?

180
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:50,635
-You see, my technique is
not ninjutsu or genjutsu.

181
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,171
-Mmmnh!

182
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:54,507
Aah!

183
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,312
[gasp] Sasuke!

184
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:58,912
-Unnhhhh!

185
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:04,019
ROCK LEE: You get it now?

186
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,521
I am using taijutsu.

187
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:07,523
That means no tricks, Sasuke.

188
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:13,364
It is just straight
martial arts, nothing more.

189
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:14,032
-Why, you--

190
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,306
-I know your technique.

191
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:20,073
Forget it.

192
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,009
It will not work, not on me.

193
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,312
I know you can see through
your opponent's jutsu.

194
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:27,750
That Sharingan gives you the
ability to read his chakra

195
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:30,020
and decipher his hand
signs and movements.

196
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:32,055
You can guess what
he's going to do almost

197
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,459
before he knows himself.

198
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:38,831
The problem is taijutsu
is a little bit different.

199
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:39,732
-Right.

200
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,067
So what's your point?

201
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,404
-I do not try to hide
or disguise my moves.

202
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,706
I do not have to.

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,377
Even if you can read them,
you still cannot stop them.

204
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,580
You are too slow.

205
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:53,216
Your eyes may be quick enough
to stay one step ahead of me,

206
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,687
but if your body cannot keep
up, what good does it do you?

207
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:57,656
-Rrrrrah!

208
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,724
-You know what?

209
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,926
Here is what I believe.

210
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,063
There are two different
kinds of ninja--

211
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,366
those like you were
born with talent

212
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,637
and do not have to work
at it, and those like me,

213
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:13,376
the ones who have to train
every day of our lives!

214
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,679
Fact is, your
Sharingan is the worst

215
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:18,449
match for my extreme taijutsu!

216
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,517
Here is what I mean.

217
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,387
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I have to stop him!

218
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,053
-Aaaaaiii-yah!

219
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,438
-Dancing Leaf Shadow.

220
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:36,206
-Good eye.

221
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,708
Now I will prove my point.

222
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:43,616
That hard work beats
out natural talent.

223
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:46,753
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
What's his next move?

224
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,423
-You're finished.

225
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:50,758
Huh?

226
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,228
[thwack]

227
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,195
[gasp]

228
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:54,930
[gasp]

229
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,565
-This is bad.

230
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:57,734
-All right, that's enough!

231
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,301
Lee?

232
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:07,813
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
What-- what now?

233
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,817
-Sasuke!

234
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:11,785
[thud]

235
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:19,428
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): He
totally beat Sasuke!

236
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:21,665
Something happened
while I was knocked out!

237
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:24,902
What'd he do?

238
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,504
[grunts with pain]

239
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,706
-Are you OK?

240
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:30,109
Sasuke!

241
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:32,112
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
He's really shaken up.

242
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:35,383
He didn't even take
the fall right.

243
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,021
-You-- you were watching
us the whole time?

244
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:40,189
-Of course.

245
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,857
That last technique
is forbidden.

246
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,259
You know that.

247
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,162
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): He's
talking to a turtle,

248
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,432
and it's talking back.

249
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:48,700
-I am sorry.

250
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,235
I did not mean to--

251
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:54,007
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Now he's
apologizing to a turtle.

252
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,211
Wait a minute-- could
that be his sensei?

253
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,521
-Aaaah!

254
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:07,157
I was not planning to
use a forbidden jutsu.

255
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,360
It was just-- I was in
the middle of the fight,

256
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,095
and I mean, you understand.

257
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,097
NARUTO: I'm right!

258
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,467
It really his sensei!

259
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:14,900
-Huh?

260
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,202
-Hm?

261
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,504
NARUTO: Hey, you guys!

262
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,872
-What, Naruto?

263
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:22,610
-That weird thing he's
talking to is a turtle, right?

264
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:23,311
-Obviously!

265
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,880
What'd you think it is?

266
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:28,252
-OK then, so maybe it means
that turtles can be sensei too.

267
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,721
-How would I know if
they can be sensei too?

268
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:32,023
-You're a disgrace!

269
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,291
-Mmm!

270
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,259
-You think you'll
get away with a bunch

271
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,228
of lame excuses like that?

272
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:38,265
A shinobi never
reveals his techniques

273
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,267
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

274
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,971
It's such a basic rule,
you should know it by now!

275
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:46,241
-Forgive me, sir.

276
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,644
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): How
could I lose to that freak?

277
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,886
[growls angrily]

278
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,056
-Are you prepared to take the
punishment for your actions?

279
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,627
-I-- yes, sir.

280
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,428
-All right, then.

281
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,463
Please come out, Guy Sensei!

282
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:07,669
-Hey!

283
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:08,404
What's shakin'?

284
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:09,772
How you doing, everybody?

285
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,107
Life treating you good?

286
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,741
-Aaaahh!

287
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:12,675
Aaaahhh!

288
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,777
Aaaahhh!

289
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,379
NARUTO: He's got the
biggest eyebrows yet!

290
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,483
They're almost alive!

291
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:21,154
-Hi, lady.

292
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,222
SAKURA: Too weird!

293
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,794
I that's where Lee gets it from.

294
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:31,467
Same soup bowl haircut
and even bushier eyebrows!

295
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,201
-Hey!

296
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:33,903
Do not insult Guy Sensei!

297
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,340
He is one of the greatest
men in the entire world!

298
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,309
-Well, excuse me for not
noticing his greatness!

299
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,011
I was too busy
watching him crawl out

300
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,247
from underneath a turtle!

301
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,082
-He did not crawl out!

302
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,817
-Give it a rest, Lee.

303
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,418
-Huh?

304
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,654
Hm.

305
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,921
Yes, sir.

306
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,624
-Now for your punishment.

307
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:50,992
Yaaahhh!

308
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,529
You little fool!

309
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:53,996
-Aaaaahhh!

310
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:54,597
Aaaahhh!

311
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,515
Aaaahhh!

312
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,282
-I'm sorry Lee, but
it's for your own good.

313
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:11,786
-Sen-- Sensei--

314
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,689
-(TEARFULLY) Oh, Lee.

315
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:18,929
-(TEARFULLY) Oh-- oh,
Sensei, I am so sorry!

316
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:19,863
-All right.

317
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:20,898
It's over.

318
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,702
You don't need to say any more.

319
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:24,703
-Sensei!

320
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:25,670
[both weeping]

321
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,673
-Lee!

322
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:28,674
-Gahhh!

323
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,043
-Uggghh!

324
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:32,914
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): How could
I lose to someone that lame?

325
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:33,815
-It's OK.

326
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:35,117
It's OK.

327
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,185
It's only a phase.

328
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,823
ROCK LEE: I am sorry, Sensei.

329
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,857
-Huh?

330
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,526
Actually, it's kind
of sweet, the way

331
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,162
they're all huggy and stuff.

332
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,130
-Huh?

333
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:46,131
You've got to be kidding!

334
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,567
They're both totally crazy!

335
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,670
-You're just caught in between.

336
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:54,041
You're too old to be called a
boy and not yet quite a man.

337
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:57,979
-You are so good
to me, Guy Sensei.

338
00:15:58,013 --> 00:15:59,514
-Now take off!

339
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,852
I want you to give me 100 laps
around the practice field.

340
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:02,886
Show me what you got!

341
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,854
-Yes, sir!

342
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:04,888
No problem.

343
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,758
-Run into the setting sun.

344
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,126
Run and suffer!

345
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,128
But don't mess up your hair.

346
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,639
Let us go!

347
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,509
-Right!

348
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,477
-Hey, wait a minute!

349
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,779
We're not finished here.

350
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:24,814
You guys can't just
take off like that.

351
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,550
-And what about
the Chunin Exams?

352
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,753
There's no time
for fooling around.

353
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,754
-Ohh.

354
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,658
Uh-- oh, right, I
forgot about that.

355
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,694
[clears throat]
Lee, you not only

356
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,463
disobeyed the rule
against fighting,

357
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,632
but you've disrupted
the Chunin Exams.

358
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,703
I think that warrants a
slightly more severe punishment,

359
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:42,705
don't you?

360
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:43,406
-Yes, sir.

361
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,341
-Let's say 500 laps!

362
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,209
How does that sound?

363
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,411
-Outstanding, sir.

364
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,283
-They're insane.

365
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:53,885
-Probably.

366
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,324
But never mind them-- what's the
deal with that turtle, anyway?

367
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:58,358
-Vo: Hm.

368
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:01,129
This must be Kakashi's squad.

369
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,697
I'll check 'em out.

370
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:03,131
-Aaah!

371
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:03,965
No!

372
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:05,668
He's looking at us!

373
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,438
MIGHT GUY: Tell me,
how is Kakashi Sensei?

374
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:11,075
SASUKE: Do you know him?

375
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,345
-Do I know Kakashi?

376
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:18,151
[chuckles] Well,
people say he and I

377
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,418
are archrivals for all eternity.

378
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,156
BOTH: There's just no way!

379
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:23,358
-How dare you?

380
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,093
If Guy Sensei says
it is true, then--

381
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,562
-Let it slide, Lee.

382
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,499
A ninja's actions always
speak louder than words.

383
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:35,039
-Hm?

384
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:36,508
Uh?

385
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,378
MIGHT GUY: My record is 50
wins and 49 losses-- which

386
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,081
is one better than
his, by the way.

387
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:41,782
[gasp]

388
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:42,348
-What?

389
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:43,116
NARUTO: Aaah?

390
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,017
You're kidding!

391
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,787
How'd he beat Kakashi?

392
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,957
-The fact is I'm
stronger than Kakashi.

393
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,494
And faster.

394
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,430
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): His
speed is incredible.

395
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:56,000
He's definitely
faster than Kakashi.

396
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,436
Is he even human?

397
00:17:58,469 --> 00:17:59,671
-You see?

398
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:03,343
Guy Sensei is the best there is.

399
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,545
-I'm sorry for the
trouble Lee caused you.

400
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:08,683
Look into my eyes and
accept my sincere apology.

401
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:11,286
Also notice my handsome
manly features.

402
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,324
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): He claims
he's better than Kakashi.

403
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:17,128
Could that be true?

404
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,262
Argh!

405
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,966
I don't think he's
making this up.

406
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,502
-Lee, you should accompany
these fine young ninjin

407
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,138
to the classroom, right now.

408
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,181
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Huh?

409
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:34,150
His hands!

410
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,291
-Remember, give it your best.

411
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:42,193
Lee, farewell.

412
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:42,827
-Yes, sir.

413
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:44,007
-Whoa!

414
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,735
-Hey, Sasuke.

415
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,538
Actually, I have not been
totally honest with you.

416
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:53,341
I said I wanted
to test my skills,

417
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,943
and that is true enough.

418
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:58,715
But you are not really the one
I wanted to test them against.

419
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,986
I lied to you when we
were fighting before.

420
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,854
I told you I'm am
the best genin here,

421
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:07,259
but there is another top
ninja, someone on my own team.

422
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,501
I came here to defeat him.

423
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,570
You were just practice.

424
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,272
Now you are a target.

425
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,009
I will crush you.

426
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,411
There you have it.

427
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,913
Consider yourself warned.

428
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,995
-Oh, Sasuke.

429
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,663
-Nyah.

430
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,465
How about that?

431
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:39,368
Looks like the Uchihas
aren't as great

432
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,337
as everybody thinks they are.

433
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,941
-Naruto!

434
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,943
-Just shut up!

435
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,446
Next time I'll drive
him to his knees!

436
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,481
-Yeah, right.

437
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:50,883
Who just got his butt kicked?

438
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,583
-Stop it!

439
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,552
What are you saying?

440
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,287
Just cut it out, Naruto!

441
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,689
[growls]

442
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,662
-You saw his hands, didn't you?

443
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:01,964
When he took off the tape?

444
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:10,275
I bet old Bushy-Brow has
been training till he drops,

445
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,411
day in and day out.

446
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,913
He trains harder than you.

447
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,118
That's all I'm saying.

448
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:25,194
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Sasuke.

449
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,977
-Fine.

450
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,380
Hmph.

451
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:41,782
-Hm?

452
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:44,753
-This thing's starting
to get interesting.

453
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:48,024
The Chunin Exams-- can't
wait to see what's next.

454
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:51,762
-Right!

455
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,100
-Let's get started.

456
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:57,436
Naruto!

457
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:58,303
Sakura!

458
00:20:58,337 --> 00:20:58,904
-Yeahhh!

459
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,538
[music - Akeboshi, "Wind"]

460
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,473
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Whoa!

461
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:44,909
All these guys are here
for the Chunin Exams?

462
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:48,146
Kiba, Shino, Hinata,
Shikamaru, and Choji?

463
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,282
Poor guys.

464
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:51,250
It's a shame I've got to
make them all look bad.

465
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:54,521
But hey, after I ace the test
and become chunin, and then

466
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:57,726
Hokage, I'll make it up
to them by-- eh, letting

467
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,495
'em boil my ramen or something.

468
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,729
Next time, Genin Takedown.

469
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:04,162
All nine rookies face off!

470
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,929
I don't want to get
cocky, but it's hard

471
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,362
not to be when you're the best.

472
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:09,262
Believe it!
