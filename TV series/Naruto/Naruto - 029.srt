167
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,401
-We've got to report this.

168
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,602
Go get the proctor.

169
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,739
-Right.

170
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:04,541
[birds chirping]

171
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:07,378
-Mm-mm, nothing makes
dumplings go down

172
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,347
like a little sweet
red bean soup.

173
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:15,221
Ah, nice!

174
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,124
Om.

175
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,391
I guess it's about that time.

176
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,228
As soon as I finish
this little snack,

177
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,263
I'll see how the
kiddies are doing.

178
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:24,301
Mm, the quicker ones
will be finishing soon.

179
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:28,440
I suppose I'll just wait
and greet them at the tower.

180
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,444
There-- a perfect
Leaf Village symbol.

[giggling]

182
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,288
-Pardon, ma'am,
there's a problem.

183
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:39,989
-Huh?

184
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,758
What sort of problem?

185
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,496
-Corpses, ma'am-- three of them.

186
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,898
-Come on, I'm
trying to eat here.

187
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,534
-I think you'll
want to see them;

188
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,338
there's something
strange about them.

[gulp]

190
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:54,475
-Besides being dead?

191
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:03,754
-I went through their
belongings and found

192
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:07,427
their identification-- ninja
from the Hidden Grass Village.

193
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,928
All three of them
were registered

194
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,332
for the Chunin Exams.

195
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,667
They weren't just killed.

196
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:19,610
-All their faces-- they're gone.

197
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:23,749
-Yeah, there's nothing where
their faces used to be,

198
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,218
like they melted or something.

199
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,627
-(VOICEOVER): No doubt about it.

200
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,895
This is his jutsu.

201
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:38,001
Why is he here?

202
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:39,803
What's he doing at
the Chunin Exams?

203
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:09,679
-OK, I need photos of what
these three used to look like.

204
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:10,646
Where are their IDs?

205
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,882
-Right here, ma'am.

206
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:18,757
-(VOICEOVER): So this
is the face he stole.

207
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:23,096
Had it already happened when--

208
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,201
-OROCHIMARU: I was just
returning your knife.

209
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,869
-Why, thank you, Grass ninja.

210
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,045
-Uh, we've got big trouble!

211
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,547
-Huh?

212
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,681
-OK, get moving.

213
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,219
Tell Lord Hokage exactly
what's happened here.

214
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,088
And while you're at
it, tell Anbu Black Ops

215
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:44,659
they'd better get a couple of
convoys to the Forest of Death.

216
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,497
Meanwhile, I'm going to
head in after these guys.

217
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,598
Now go!

218
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:49,335
-Right!

219
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,672
-(VOICEOVER): He's come.

220
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,041
He's here in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

221

[wind blowing]

222

-OROCHIMARU: (CHUCKLING)
What a tasty little meal

223
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,465
you'll make for him.

224
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:17,972
Careful, he likes to
play with his food.

225
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:19,940
-Ahh!

-Ha ha.

233
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,328
Enough playing, finish him off.

Eat this!

237
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:05,937
-(VOICEOVER): But how?

238
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,339
It's impossible.

-Look at him-- he's gone nuts.

241
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:22,893
Whoa, where did he get that
kind of power all of a sudden?

00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:26,332
-Ugh.

Yaaah!

there's no mistaking it.

-Oh, things have gotten
very interesting.

well you do, Sasuke.

-This could be bad.

256

I've got to hurry and
pray I'm not too late.

-Hey kid, you're
not hurt, are you?

No way, you're not
the Sasuke I know.

Uh.

I see-- when your
anger is aroused,

279
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:07,718
some of the Nine-Tailed
Foxes' chakra is released.

What an interesting
childhood you must have had.

281

The spell that seals him within
you has appeared on your skin.

Hurry, do something!

the seal has remained unbroken.

Soon, the demon's chakra and
the boys' will be as one.

But for now, he's
just in my way.

OK, say what you
like about Naruto--

that he's a pest, that
he gets in the way,

297

that he's just a kid.

298
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,419
But at least, he's--
he's doing something!

299
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,421
At least, he's no coward!

you can't kill me.

extent of his powers.

own death if I fight this fight.

And to defeat my
brother, I must survive.

And yet, if I haven't the
courage to face this demon,

how can I ever hope to face him?
