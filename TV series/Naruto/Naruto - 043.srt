[theme song]

2
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,803
-For the fifth match, Tenten.

3
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:55,009
Temari, get ready.

4
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:00,486
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
I'm so ready.

5
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,993
After watching that last
match, I'm fired up.

6
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,838
MAN: So this is another
genin from the Sand Village.

7
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:10,606
-Come on, Tenten.

8
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,808
You can do it.

9
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:12,810
-This should be
interesting to watch.

10
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,946
-Show her who is best.

11
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:29,611
-Begin.

12
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:32,149
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Killer
Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru.

13
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:37,994
-Huh?

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,802
-All right, Tenten.

15
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:43,371
Keep her guessing.

16
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:44,207
-Go for it.

17
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,676
You've got the power of youth.

18
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,078
-Come on, Tenten.

19
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,082
Send that girl back to her
village on a stretcher.

20
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:51,855
We're right behind you
all the way, Tenten.

21
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,191
-Let's hear it.

22
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,660
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

23
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:55,429
-Woo.

24
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:56,564
-Tenten, Tenten!

25
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,635
-Ugh, how'd I get stuck
in the cheering section?

26
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:02,543
[cheering]

27
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,144
-[yawn].

28
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:11,361
-Tenten is carefully
determining her distance,

29
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,531
just what I'd expect from her.

30
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:16,336
She's well positioned
to attack or defend.

31
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,107
-What are you waiting for?

32
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,843
I did say to begin.

33
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:26,156
-Ha, guess she's waiting
for me to make a move.

34
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,394
Big mistake, because
that first move

35
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:30,632
I make will be the
last one you see.

36
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,243
Come on, I don't want this mat
ch to be over too quickly, so

37
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,447
why don't you go first?

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,216
Come on, girl.

39
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,785
Show me what you got.

40
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,587
-Well, OK.

41
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,658
If you insist.

42
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,494
Remember, you asked for it.

43
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,310
I missed her!

44
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:54,512
There's just no way.

45
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,717
-What was that, a
warm-up exercise?

46
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:59,757
Or maybe you're a little nervous
and its affected your aim.

47
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,393
Is that it?

48
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,399
Rats, I was hoping I'd
at least work up a sweat.

49
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:08,740
But forget that idea if
this is the best you've got.

50
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:09,977
-What is going on?

51
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,045
How could she have missed?

52
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,748
It is incredible.

53
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,719
-It's impossible.

54
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,957
Tenten's aim is perfect.

55
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,961
She always hits her mark.

56
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:21,199
-Not this time she didn't.

57
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:23,269
-She never misses.

58
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:27,044
There must have been
something that made her miss.

59
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,313
-Huh?

60
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:29,882
-You know, you can
always count on Temari

61
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,553
to put on a good show.

62
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,389
-Uh, big deal.

63
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,961
-Man, this is embarrassing.

64
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:37,231
-Huh?

65
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,035
-The Sand Village wins again.

66
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:40,203
-What are you talking about?

67
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,006
The match just started.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,276
-It's over.

69
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:44,245
-Give me a break.

70
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:46,616
What makes you so smart?

71
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,020
Why don't you explain it
to me so I can understand?

72
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:50,791
-Uh, skip it.

73
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:55,567
If you can't see it, I'm not
going to waste my breath.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,174
-It's obvious like he
said, this one's over.

75
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,778
-Ah, I don't get it.

76
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:03,316
I really don't understand
these guys at all.

77
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,393
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
OK, stay calm.

78
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:09,896
don't let her get to you.

79
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:17,043
One, two, three.

80
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,080
She must have
dodged them somehow.

81
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:21,652
But if I try a
different approach--

82
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,389
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Ha-ha-ha.

83
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,128
Look at her measuring
her distance.

84
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,334
Here comes her big move.

85
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,071
TENTEN (VOICEOVER):
So that's her secret,

86
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,874
that fan she carries.

87
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:33,476
OK.

88
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,833
All right, try this on for size.

89
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:06,674
No way.

90
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,347
she stopped everything I threw.

91
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,854
What has she got in
that fan of hers?

92
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:14,256
-Ha-ha, take a look.

93
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,227
This is the first moon.

94
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,999
There are two more.

95
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,872
When you see all three
moons you'll know,

96
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,976
you've lost the match.

97
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:31,023
-Tenten, do not play
your opponent's game.

98
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,125
Maintain focus.

99
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,564
Maintain focus.

100
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,033
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): I know, Lee.

101
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,435
I know.

102
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,339
Well, I was planning to
save this for the finals,

103
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:41,410
not waste it on a
preliminary round,

104
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,915
but it may be now or never.

105
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,230
-Ha.

106
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:54,569
-She's using that already?

107
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:57,542
-What's with the two scrolls?

108
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,716
What is she planning
on doing with them?

109
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:06,828
-Ha.

110
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,599
It won't work, whatever it is.

111
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:16,948
-Rising twin dragons.

112
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,923
-Ha.

113
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,960
It doesn't matter how
many you throw at me.

114
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,966
It's all the same.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,934
Moon number two!

116
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:53,286
-I'm not done!

117
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,556
Ha.

118
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:13,727
Ha, I've got her now.

119
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:29,825
-Moon number three.

120
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:35,804
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): Huh?

121
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,209
Where did she go?

122
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:42,751
She-- she's gone.

123
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:43,720
TEMARI: Over here.

124
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:44,855
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): What?

125
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:04,361
-Now it's my turn.

126
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:05,396
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

127
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:09,765
-Tenten!

128
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,367
-Temari's chakra is
controlling the vertex.

129
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:25,503
-Huh?

130
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:28,843
-She fought well,
but she'll never

131
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,513
escape from that whirlwind.

132
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:31,481
It's over.

133
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,134
-[cough].

134
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,872
-Whoa, that girl's
really ruthless.

135
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:46,478
-Oh, Tenten.

136
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:49,183
-Wasn't much of a match.

137
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,555
Kind of boring.

138
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:55,529
-To be able to stop every one
of Tenten's attacks like that.

139
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,099
-I still cannot believe it.

140
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,170
-It was impressive all right.

141
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,305
Scary.

142
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:02,877
-Yep, it's another win
for the Sand Village,

143
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,513
just like you said it would be.

144
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:05,415
-Well, of course.

145
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:06,785
That's why I said it.

146
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:08,789
-Well, looks like
we're guaranteed

147
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:11,194
a clean sweep in this round.

148
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,063
-Hm.

149
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:18,842
-This Sand team is
clearly one to be feared.

150
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,179
-The winner of the
fifth match, Temari.

151
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:25,555
-Wait a second.

152
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:26,156
-Hm?

153
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:36,951
-Ugh.

154
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:43,057
-Hey, nice catch.

155
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,693
-What is wrong with you?

156
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,397
She may have lost,
but that is no way

157
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,701
to treat an opponent
who has done her best.

158
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,772
TEMARI: Oh, beat it.

159
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:54,445
And take that sack
of garbage with you.

160
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,615
-No, Lee!

161
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:56,449
Lee!

162
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:57,251
-Leaf Hurricane!

163
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,694
-Not even close.

164
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,696
You know what?

165
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,499
You're as dumb as you look.

166
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,301
-What did you say?

167
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:07,772
-Lee, stop.

168
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:10,477
-But Guy sensei.

169
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:13,383
-Temari, forgot them.

170
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:16,589
The match is over,
so get up here.

171
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,059
You won.

172
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,996
Why are you wasting your
time with that pathetic loser

173
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,301
and his ridiculous mentor?

174
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:23,244
-What?

175
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:35,160
-Just calm down, Lee.

176
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,172
A word of warning.

177
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:45,381
You Sand villagers have no
idea what Lee is capable of.

178
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:49,154
Remember, he still
hasn't fought yet.

179
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,691
So I'd be careful if I were you.

180
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:57,337
-That kid's crazy picking
a fight with them.

181
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,575
Those Sand Village
guys are trouble.

182
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:01,846
They're the last people
I'd want to go up against.

183
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,418
-They do look almost unbeatable.

184
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,200
SAKURA: Don't worry, Naruto.

185
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,972
I'm sure you could take them.

186
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:16,208
-Sakura?

187
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:17,477
What, you're all right?

188
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,414
I never thought you'd
be back so soon.

189
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,185
-I'm fine, but never mind me.

190
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:23,021
It's you you should
be thinking about.

191
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:23,622
-Huh?

192
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:24,825
Me?

193
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,362
I don't have any injuries.

194
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:27,865
I haven't even fought yet.

195
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:30,270
-What I meant was you don't
want to disgrace yourself

196
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:32,206
after you worked so
hard to get here.

197
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,378
Think of what Sasuke will say.

198
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:34,879
-Oh.

199
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,448
Oh, right.

200
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,319
-Stay sharp.

201
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:41,692
Oh, thanks, by the way.

202
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,596
-No, Sakura, don't.

203
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,839
You worked so hard
to get here, Sakura.

204
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:52,680
Don't disgrace yourself now by
losing to that lame Ino girl.

205
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:55,352
SAKURA: If you hadn't
called out when you did,

206
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:57,256
who knows what
would have happened?

207
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:00,896
If it hadn't been for you,
I might not still be here.

208
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,235
-Yeah, that's probably true.

209
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,337
-Oh, you little--

210
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:09,748
-Here we go.

211
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:10,449
Let it be me.

212
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:11,251
Please, let it be me.

213
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:12,086
Let it be me.

214
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:12,720
-No, it's my turn.

215
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:13,208
My turn.

216
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,032
-Grr.

217
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,836
-Guess it's me.

218
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,772
-Shikamaru, come on.

219
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,074
You can do it.

220
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,543
You can win this no problem.

221
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:25,746
-OK, OK.

222
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,084
-All you got to do is tell
yourself, I cannot lose.

223
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:29,754
Right?

224
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:35,164
CHOJI (VOICEOVER): Man, when did
she get so darn enthusiastic?

225
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:38,070
-Remember, he
manipulates shadows.

226
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:40,609
Watch the shadows.

227
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:41,912
-Ha.

228
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:44,918
You think I'd ever fall for
a stupid jutsu like that?

229
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:50,161
-Yeah, OK.

230
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:51,130
Here we go, Shikamaru.

231
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,368
Make that little girl cry.

232
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:55,973
-Oh man, this is such a drag.

233
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:57,042
I mean, give me a break.

234
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:59,713
I've got to fight a girl?

235
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:02,085
-Yeah, you just keep
thinking that way, little ma.

236
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,623
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): I knew
what these guys were capable

237
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,062
of from the time we
met them in the forest

238
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:08,030
during the second exam.

239
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:18,184
Problem is, I didn't
get a look at her jutsu.

240
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:22,759
And to make things
worse, she saw mine.

241
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:23,594
MAN: Ready?

242
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,429
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): Oh, well.

243
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,699
MAN: Sixth match.

244
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,101
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Nothing I can do.

245
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:28,705
MAN: Shikamaru and Kin.

246
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:29,873
Begin.

247
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,243
-It's all I've got.

248
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:33,314
KIN: You're not trying that
stupid shadow thing again, are

249
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,148
you?

250
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:35,451
-Shut your mouth!

251
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:38,290
Ninja art, Shadow
Possession Jutsu.

252
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,492
-Is that all you know?

253
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,795
If that's the only
trick you've got,

254
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,600
this is going to be
easier than I thought.

255
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,420
-Bells?

256
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:54,288
Oh, please.

257
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,092
Not that old trick.

258
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,495
Let me guess.

259
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,365
Next, you'll throw senbon
with bells and senbon

260
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,636
without bells at the same time.

261
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,742
I'll react to the
bells and while I'm

262
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:07,682
focused on dodging
them, I won't notice

263
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,519
the silent needles coming at me.

264
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:12,024
Am I right?

265
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,359
Good luck.

266
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,063
-You sure talk a lot, don't you?

267
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,670
-Now I know to be careful to
dodge all the senbon, not just

268
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,507
the ones with the bells.

269
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,043
[bells ringing]

270
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:23,313
What?

271
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:25,217
Where?

272
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,291
[bells ringing]

273
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,930
Threads?

274
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:32,531
Oh, man.

275
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,067
-Too late.

276
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,971
-Ah.

277
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:36,806
-Shikamaru.

278
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,075
-Well, that didn't take long.

279
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,578
-Hold on, don't be so sure.

280
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,748
He's not beaten yet.

281
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:42,050
-Huh?

282
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,690
-One inch higher and that
would have been a fatal hit.

283
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,527
OK, now I get a turn.

284
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:49,230
-Sorry, that was your turn.

285
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:03,025
-What the-- what's going on?

286
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:03,626
Ugh.

287
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,640
-You see, you don't ever ask
for whom the bells tolls,

288
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,243
because it tolls for thee.

289
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:15,550
This bell sends off a
peculiar sound vibration

290
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,687
that travels to the
outer and inner ear,

291
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,424
then directly to the brain.

292
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:24,935
First comes paralysis, and soon
you'll start hallucinating.

293
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:25,703
-Uh.

294
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,273
-It won't work.

295
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:30,512
You can't block the sound out
once it's inside your head.

296
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,682
It's useless.

297
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,994
-I can't tell which one
of them is the real one.

298
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:40,499
-You can't move
your arms or legs.

299
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,171
And even if you could, you
wouldn't know which one of us

300
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,509
to throw your shadow at.

301
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,881
Face it, you're
cooked, little man.

302
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:54,627
I'm going to cook you nice
and slow over a hot fire.

303
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,799
-You think it's that easy, huh?

304
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,209
Ah.

305
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,011
-That was three.

306
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:06,017
Next time, I'll throw five.

307
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,855
Each time, a couple
more till you end up

308
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:10,191
looking like a hedgehog.

309
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,530
-Stop playing games,
why don't you?

310
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:13,765
KIN: Hm?

311
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,268
-If you're so tough,
get it over with.

312
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,272
Stop wasting my time.

313
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:18,808
-I'm sorry.

314
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,746
So you're not a fan of my
slow and painful method, huh?

315
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,315
[bells ringing]

316
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,685
Fine, suit yourself.

317
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,858
We'll do it the quick
way then, and painful.

318
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:36,510
Wh-- what's wrong?

319
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:38,013
Can't move my arm.

320
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:39,416
-Huh.

321
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:44,125
-It looks like my lame shadow
jutsu was a success after all.

322
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:47,733
-But you haven't
thrown any shadows.

323
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,070
No way, I made sure of it.

324
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:50,906
-Ha.

325
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,311
You really still don't see it?

326
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:54,446
-What do you mean?

327
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,283
SHIKAMARU: Look at that
thread you're holding.

328
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,788
Don't you find it a little
strange that it would even

329
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:02,362
cast a shadow at this height?

330
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:05,000
Of course you didn't notice it
because you were concentrating

331
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,705
on other things,
like killing me.

332
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:13,684
-The shadow spreading out around
me and I didn't see it coming.

333
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,220
-Right.

334
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:16,890
I stretched my shadow out
along the line of that thread

335
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,393
and followed it
all the way back.

336
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:19,863
Now I'm attached to you.

337
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,109
-And now, so we mirror
each other's movements.

338
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:27,178
So what?

339
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,448
A cute trick, but what
do you gain by it?

340
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,918
-Man, you're annoying.

341
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,088
Shut up and watch.

342
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:38,601
Hm.

343
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,938
-You must be insane.

344
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,143
If you throw that
shuriken at me,

345
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:46,416
you'll just be
attacking yourself.

346
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:49,455
-Makes it kind of
interesting, doesn't it?

347
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:50,390
-You wouldn't.

348
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:51,727
You couldn't.

349
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,663
-Yeah, like a game of chicken.

350
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,367
Let's see who ducks first.

351
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,135
-You're crazy.

352
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:03,049
Big deal.

353
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,086
I'll do that, too.

354
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,593
-And that's what I
call using your head.

355
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:12,267
The wise shinobi carefully
scouts the physical layout

356
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,006
of the battlefield
and never loses

357
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,809
sight of his position on it.

358
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,179
That was her problem.

359
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,617
I made sure she was so
busy focusing on me,

360
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,422
she didn't notice the wall
inches behind her head.

361
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,562
So when we both dodge
backwards, kabong!

362
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,265
Now who's hearing bells?

363
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,171
-Winner of the sixth
match, Shikamaru Nara.

364
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:32,841
-That a boy, Shikamaru.

365
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:34,444
-Yeah, way to go.

366
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,079
-Come on.

367
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:36,048
Come on, me next.

368
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,285
Me next, me next, me.

369
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,890
-Even that good-for-nothing
lazy bum won his match.

370
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:43,529
When am I going to get my turn?

371
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:44,531
Ugh.

372
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:47,303
-Now there's only me left.

373
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:50,877
MAN: All right, moving
on to the next match.

374
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,182
-There's one Sound
Village ninja left.

375
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,889
There's me, you, Naruto,
Choji, Neji, Lee,

376
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:59,126
and that Sand Village guy.

377
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,003
Just don't put me up against
him, that's all I ask.

378
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,974
-This year's rookies
look like they

379
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:07,577
could be quite a challenge.

380
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:24,376
-Yeah, it's here.

381
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,615
It's here at last, the
moment I've been waiting for.

382
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:30,055
Finally, I get a chance
to show what I've got.

383
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:31,758
-Look at that, it's
us against the kid.

384
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:35,432
Hey, Akamaru, I think you
and I just won the lottery.

385
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,703
[bark]

386
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,275
-I am going to die of old
age before I get my turn.

387
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:43,013
I just want a chance to show
Sakura what I am made of.

388
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,285
She's going to get
tired of waiting.

389
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:46,855
All I want is a chance.

390
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:47,890
-Lee.

391
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:48,925
LEE: Is that too much to ask?

392
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,794
-He's just like Guy used to be.

393
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:57,476
-Good luck, Naruto.

394
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:59,079
Do your best.

395
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:01,083
-You know it, Sakura.

396
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,554
-It's your moment, Naruto.

397
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:05,224
Go on, show us.

398
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:06,795
Show us how much you've grown.

399
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,905
-It's my time to shine.

400
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:25,264
[theme song]

401
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,574
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This
Kiba guy drives me nuts.

402
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,412
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

403
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:57,915
And that little mutt of his?

404
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:59,050
Yap, yap, yap.

405
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,787
I don't know which one
of them's more annoying.

406
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:04,695
But I don't care, talk all
you want, train all you want.

407
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,066
At the end of the day,
you're all going home,

408
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:08,236
and I'm going to be Hokage.

409
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:09,404
Did I say believe it?

410
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,440
Believe it.

411
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,178
Next time, Akamaru unleashed.

412
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,945
Who's top dog now?
