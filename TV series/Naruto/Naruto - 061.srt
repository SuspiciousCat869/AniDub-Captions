IRUKA (VOICEOVER): So
his opponent is Neji.

00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,697
These final rounds are
nothing like the preliminaries

7
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:10,704
as Naruto will find out.

8
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:11,740
If he hasn't already.

9
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,451
-Put on a good show
will you, Naruto?

10
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,758
You know, I've got
a tough job to do

11
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:38,932
and I'd like to be entertained
while I'm doing it.

We're not even getting
close to this guy.

20
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:28,040
-You think I can be fooled
with a trick like that?

21
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:38,029
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Conjure
all the clones you want.

You can't hide from me.

[gasps]

25
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,554
NEJI: You're the one keeping
out of range for fear of my

26
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:53,262
striking your chakra
points like this.

27
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:55,167
The more the others
attack, the more

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,836
you stand out for holding back.

29
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,050
You're the real one, aren't you?

30
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,387
-Naruto.

31
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,956
-The match is over.

32
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:12,805
-I told you it was pointless.

33
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:16,346
-No.

34
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,916
Don't give up, Naruto.

35
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:23,161
[laughs]

36
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,065
-Oh yeah?

37
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,172
And I told you it was a
mistake to count me out.

38
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,047
-But how?

39
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,595
-All right!

40
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:41,935
Way to go Naruto!

41
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:43,673
-Naruto.

42
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:47,414
NEJI: He held one of his
clones back to deceive me,

43
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:48,750
to lure me into a trap.

44
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:50,789
NARUTO: You thought I'd
be too much of a chicken

45
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:51,690
to attack you myself.

46
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,194
Well, think again!

47
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,196
[yells]

48
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,086
-But that--

49
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:19,652
-Uh?

50
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,923
What the heck was that?

51
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:23,393
-Did you really think you'd won?

52
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,335
-What happened?

53
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,642
-That punch of Naruto's
should have flattened him.

54
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,781
-But that was--

55
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,023
-Rotation.

56
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,304
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): That's one
of Neji's special defenses.

57
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,749
-We'll see about that!

58
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,430
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): Neji
can see almost 360 degrees

59
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,401
with his Byakugan.

60
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:58,804
It's pointless.

61
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,076
He can detect any attack
as soon as it's launched.

62
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,185
That's when his
real defense comes

63
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:07,991
into play, the Eight
Trigrams Palms Rotation.

64
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:30,407
The moment he senses an attack,
Neji discharges an intense,

65
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,780
focused burst of chakra from
the chakra's points in his body.

66
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:35,885
Then, by rotating
his body quickly,

67
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,126
he builds up enough energy
to not only block, but repel

68
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,130
his attacker.

69
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,669
Normally, chakra emitted
from chakra points

70
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,406
is difficult to control.

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,678
Even <i>jonin</i> can
usually only utilize chakra

72
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:51,419
from a single body part at a
time, like the hands or feet.

73
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,426
But Neji's mastery of
the Gentle Fist Taijutsu

74
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,700
is so great, that he can emit
chakra from several places,

75
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:01,140
warding off simultaneous attacks
from multiple directions.

76
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,648
It's an ultimate defense,
even more impenetrable

77
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,120
than Gaara's Shield of Sand.

78
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,657
Nothing can get through it.

79
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:18,044
-But I thought
only father could.

80
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:20,182
-It's a secret ninja art.

81
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:23,389
For generations, reserved
only for the main household

82
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:25,360
of the Hyuga clan.

83
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:28,601
But Neji has somehow
discovered it on his own,

84
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,772
incredible as it may seem.

85
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,476
He's come far.

86
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,447
TENTEN (VOICEOVER): No
one should be surprised.

87
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,890
You haven't even begun
to see his full powers.

88
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,262
[grunting]

89
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,369
NEJI: This is the end for you.

90
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:47,743
You're in range and you can't
escape my Eight Trigrams.

91
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:02,141
Gentle Fist art.

92
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,980
Eight Trigrams 64 Palms.

93
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,350
-Let's dance.

94
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:07,720
It can't be.

95
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,107
-Eight Trigrams.

96
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:24,457
Four palm.

97
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,430

00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,784

[screams]

102
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:43,298
-Have we been surpassed
by this branch family?

103
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,333
-Looks like it's over.

104
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,321
-To think that Hyuga's Kekkei
Genkai would find its purest

105
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:13,598
form in this child of a
lesser branch of the clan,

106
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:18,241
a child banished from
the line of succession.

107
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,279
Truly, my brother,
you've been denied

108
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:23,887
what is rightfully yours.

109
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,662
-I have now struck all
64 of your chakra points.

110
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:31,370
You're lucky to
still be breathing.

111
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,740
-Act.

112
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,844
Come on!

113
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:39,354
-Well, must be frustrating to
realize how utterly hopeless

114
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:42,895
it all was, this
little dream of yours.

115
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,770
You thought you could succeed
through hard work alone.

116
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,642
That's only an illusion.

117
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,045
[coughs]

118
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:52,851
-Hey, Hinata, what's
wrong, you OK?

119
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:53,886
-What a fool!

120
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,790
I almost thought he could win.

121
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:56,392
-Naruto.

122
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,796
-Bushy brow.

123
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:32,504
Hinata.

124
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,294
No way.

125
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,896
-Huh?

126
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,414
-Come on!

127
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,597
[breathing hard]

128
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:04,909
-Impossible.

129
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:06,478
How could he?

130
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:14,696
-I told you, I just don't
know when to give up.

131
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:29,339
-It can't be!

132
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,942
[coughs]

133
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:31,844
-Hey!

134
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:32,613
Hey!

135
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:33,916
You're coughing up blood.

136
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:36,254
-What is it?

137
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:37,524
-Oh wow.

138
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:40,831
You must still be
injured from your match.

139
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,835
Hinata, you going
to be all right?

140
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,372
You need some
water or something?

141
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:51,154
-Let me have a look at her.

142
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:52,222
-Who are you?

143
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:53,559
-It's all right.

144
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,830
You can trust me.

145
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,834
-Stop this madness.

146
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,839
You'll only get
more of the same.

147
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:02,512
I have nothing against
you personally.

148
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:03,614
-That's touching.

149
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:05,618
You're going to make me cry.

150
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:08,458
Anyway, I've got
plenty against you.

151
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:10,596
-I don't know what you mean.

152
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,999
-You don't?

153
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,240
And here I thought you
were Mr. Know-It-All.

154
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:18,747
You don't remember what
you did to Hinata, huh?

155
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,420
The way you worked on
her with your mind games,

156
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:25,128
tearing her down when she
worked so hard to get here.

157
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,197
-Never mind that.

158
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,900
It doesn't concern you.

159
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,471
NARUTO: You mocked
Hinata, calling

160
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:34,582
her a failure, all that stuff
about the great Hyuga clan,

161
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:36,519
main household, branch families.

162
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:39,125
What a bunch of crap!

163
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,566
It doesn't give you the right
to decide who is a failure.

164
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,270
That's what I've
got against you.

165
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,151
-Hey!

166
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:51,719
What are you?

167
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:52,488
-Don't worry.

168
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:52,989
I'm a doctor.

169
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:57,465
-Very well.

170
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:00,973
As you are so interested
in it, I'll tell you about.

171
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:05,116
The Hyuga clan's
heritage of hatred.

172
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,587
For generations, the main
household of our clan

173
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:13,801
has practiced a secret ninjutsu
known as the cursed mark jutsu.

174
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,404
-Cursed mark jutsu?

175
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:25,026
-The curse mark is the symbol
of a bird locked in its cage.

176
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,567
It's the mark of those who are
bound to a destiny they cannot

177
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,169
escape.

178
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:42,431
-Uh.

179
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:43,666
Is, is that?

180
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:59,000
That's the curse mark?

181
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:02,074
-I was four years old when
the leaders of my clan

182
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,011
branded this symbol
on my forehead

183
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:05,581
with their cursed mark jutsu.

184
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,860
On that same day,
a great celebration

185
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,131
took place in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

186
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:15,303
After many years of
war, a peace agreement

187
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,410
had at last been reached
with the Land of Lightning

188
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:21,116
and they had sent the Head
Cloud Ninja to sign the treaty

189
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,387
and join in the celebration.

190
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,394
Everyone was there to
welcome our old enemies.

191
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:29,434
Every genin and jonin
in the Leaf Village.

192
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:34,778
Only one clan was
absent, the Hyuga clan.

193
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,382
Because this was
the day on which

194
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,656
the heir to the main
household was to turn three.

195
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,336
It was Lady Hinata's
third birthday.

196
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,940
Her father, Lord Hiashi
Hyuga, is sitting up there.

197
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:07,484
He and my father, Hizashi,
are twin brothers.

198
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:10,657
And yet, he entered
into the world first,

199
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:14,465
so he is head of the
family, the firstborn.

200
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,306
While my father,
his twin brother,

201
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,114
is banished to a lesser
branch of the family.

202
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:23,820
-So Lady Hinata is
three years old.

203
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,557
Congratulations.

204
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,191
-Thank you.

205
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:36,882
-She looks nice,
Father, don't you think?

206
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,465
What is it, Father?

207
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,736
What's wrong?

208
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,411
-Oh, it's nothing, my son.

209
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:55,089
-Hizashi, it's time I
took Neji under my wing.

210
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,692
-Yes.

211
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:59,665
NEJI: It was then, on the day
the heir to the main household

212
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,141
turned three that the
curse mark was put on me

213
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:08,684
and I was made a bird in
a cage by my own uncle.

214
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,292
-You and this clan of yours,
what's the point of it all?

215
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:14,932
Why have a main family
and a branch family?

216
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:16,869
And this weird curse mark?

217
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,305
What's it mean anyway?

218
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,310
-I can assure you of one thing.

219
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:21,780
It's not simply for decoration.

220
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,706
-Your kick is still weak.

221
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,713
-Yes.

222
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,316
[screaming]

223
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:44,663
-Listen, Neji, is your
destiny clear to you?

224
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:46,935
You live only to
protect Lady Hinata

225
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:50,844
and to preserve the power
of our clan's main house.

226
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,615
-I understand, Father.

227
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,084
[music playing]

228
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:15,866
-It's wet.

229
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,402
Hiya!

230
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,738
[screaming]

231
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:24,952
-Father!

232
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,500
Father, what is it?

233
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,404
-Take your father home.

234
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,878
I'll forgive the fool this
time, but only this time.

235
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:39,417
See that you never
forget your destiny.

236
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:48,470
NEJI: You see, this is more
than a mark that we wear.

237
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:50,241
It is also the
instrument by which

238
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,579
they keep us in our place.

239
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,619
We live with the fear that
they will use this curse mark

240
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:59,527
to turn our brains to
jelly any time they wish.

241
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,200
Fear, that is what
we live with it.

242
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,538
And we live with it every day.

243
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:07,244
Only in death are we free of it.

244
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:10,886
This is how the power of the
Byakugan is kept sealed away.

245
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,632
Only the Hyuga
possess the secret

246
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:19,638
of this unique form
of Kekkei Genkai.

247
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:25,050
And of course, there are many
who would steal it from us.

248
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,821
That is why we exist.

249
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:30,128
It is the purpose of the branch
family to defend that secret

250
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:33,769
and to serve the keepers of the
secret-- the main household--

251
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:37,377
obediently and without
question for eternity.

252
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:46,063
That is our destiny or was
until that dreadful night they

253
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:48,268
went too far.

254
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,573
When they murdered my father!

255
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:57,388
One night, someone
entered the main household

256
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:58,824
and abducted Lady Hinata.

257
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,036
[door opens]

258
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:29,559
Lord Hiashi quickly
caught and killed the man.

259
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:31,429
And who was this
intruder, stealing

260
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:36,039
through the shadows in the
dead of night, wearing a mask

261
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:37,643
over his face?

262
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,982
It was none other than
the Head Cloud Ninja

263
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:42,921
of the Land of Lightning,
the man who had just

264
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,527
signed an alliance with us.

265
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,997
It was obvious to
everyone that he

266
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,004
was after the secret
of the Byakugan.

267
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:51,874
But the Land of
Lightning professed shock

268
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:54,547
at this willful
murder of their ninja.

269
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,320
They claimed that the Hidden
Leaf Village was in violation

270
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:59,791
of the treaty and they
demanded recompense.

271
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,146
Things got worse
and worse until it

272
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,018
looked like war
would break out anew.

273
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:16,361
The Leaf Village wanted above
all things to avoid a war,

274
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,599
so at last they made a deal.

275
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:19,501
NARUTO: A deal?

276
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:21,874
NEJI: A life for a life.

277
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,677
The Land of Lightning
demanded the death

278
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:26,049
of the person who had
slain their ninja.

279
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,390
If there was to be peace,
Lord Hiashi must die.

280
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:35,937
The Leaf Village
accepted their terms.

281
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,911
HANABI: But Father, then how?

282
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:45,391
-And so to avert a war a man
was killed, but not Hiashi.

283
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:49,199
My father, his twin brother,
was killed in his place

284
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:52,674
in order to protect
the main household.

285
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:55,480
Only in death was my
father finally free

286
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:57,652
of this evil curse mark.

287
00:20:57,685 --> 00:21:01,160
They were so much
alike-- twin brothers--

288
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,598
but their destinies
had been determined

289
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:08,108
long ago when one was born a
few seconds after the other.

290
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:15,190
And this match is the same.

291
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,195
Your destiny was
decided the moment

292
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,533
I was chosen as your opponent.

[music playing]

294

-This guy and his magic
fingers or Gentle Fist,

or whatever he calls it.

296
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,539
He knows just which points
to hit to shut off my chakra

297
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,377
and without it I'm helpless.

298
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,347
Feels like that time I
used up all my chakra

299
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:17,053
when I was training
with the Pervy Sage.

300

Wait a second, that's it!

301

Yeah.

302
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,933
I could also squeeze out
a little more chakra.
