we have several available tasks.

the shopping, digging
up potatoes, and--

-No!

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,453
I want to go on a real
mission, something

47
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,556
challenging and exciting,
not this little kid stuff!

48
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:50,924
Come on, old man!

00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,359
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
He's got a point.

SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
But he's such a pain.

51
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:58,098
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): [sighs]
I knew this was coming.

52
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,470
-How dare you?

53
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:05,073
You're just a brand-new
Genin with no experience.

54
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,175
Like everyone else, you
start with simple missions

55
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,277
to develop your skills
and prove yourself.

56
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,579
-Are you serious?

57
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,414
Babysitting is not a mission.

58
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,350
It's just a stupid-- [shout]

59
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,486

OLD MAN: It seems
you do not understand

63
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:26,095
the tasks you have been given.

64
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:29,199
Listen, many different
kinds of requests

65
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:33,369
come into our village
every day, from babysitting

66
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,405
to assassinations.

67
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:41,044
These requests are carefully
recorded, analyzed, then ranked

68
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:46,417
A, B, C, or D, depending
on their difficulty.

69
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,354
We ninja are also ranked
by ability-- Hokage

70
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:56,128
at the top, Jonin, Chunin,
and Genin at the bottom.

71
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,864
At the highest level,
we select the missions

72
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,800
and assign them to ninja who
have the appropriate skill

73
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,169
and experience.

74
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,305
And if the mission
is successful,

75
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:11,444
we receive a fee that supports
our village and our work.

76
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,114
Since you are untried Genin,
just starting down the Shinobi

77
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:20,287
path, you are given D-level
assignments, of course.

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,288
Hmm?

79
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,157
-So I had this tonkotsu
ramen yesterday,

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,691
and I'm thinking
miso ramen today.

00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,127
-Silence!

00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,663

to pull pranks all the time.

00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,374

want a ninja mission.

OLD MAN: Naruto wants
us to know that he's not

93
00:05:56,525 --> 00:06:01,331
a brat-- he's a former brat,
and he wants a mission.

94
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:02,632
So be it.

95
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:03,233
-Huh?

96
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,167
-Huh?

97
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:06,369
-Since you are so
determined, I'm

98
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:09,773
going to give you
a C-ranked mission.

99
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:12,375
You'll be bodyguards
on a journey.

100
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,777
-Really?

101
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:14,712
Yes!

00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:17,148
Are we guarding a princess?

105
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,517
Or some [inaudible] counselor?

-Don't be so impatient.

107
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,355
I will bring him in now.

00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,558
and to me, you'll still
be nobody, a loser.

166
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:03,693
-Ah!

167
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,328
I'm going to make you
pay for that right now!

168
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,531
-I told you, you're supposed
to protect the client,

169
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,799
not attack him.

170
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:09,500
-Give me one shot at him!

171
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,066
Let me go!

172
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,202
I'll show you!

173
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:15,439
That's right, I'm
talking to you!

174
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,208
[birds chirping]

175
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:19,777
SAKURA: Say, Mr. Tazuna?

176
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,045
-What is it?

177
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,516
-Your country is the
Land of Waves, right?

178
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:25,417
-Yeah.

179
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,884
What of it?

180
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:30,555
-Kakashi sensei, there are
ninja in that country, too,

181
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:31,690
aren't there?

182
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:34,727
-No, there are no ninja
in the Land of Waves.

183
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,231
But in other countries,
there are hidden villages,

184
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:41,100
each with their own different
customs and cultures,

185
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,335
where ninja reside.

186
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,206
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
To the people

187
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,176
of this continent, the existence
of Shinobi villages means

188
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,747
strength, military strength.

189
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,818
In other words, that's how they
protect themselves and maintain

190
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:00,621
the balance of power with
neighboring countries.

191
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:04,024
The ninja villages are not
controlled by any government.

192
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,394
They're independent,
and have equal status.

193
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:11,366
Now, a small island
like the Land of Waves

194
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,401
has natural protection
from the sea,

195
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:15,671
so there's no need
for a ninja village.

196
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:23,045
The five ancient lands that
possess Shinobi villages

197
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,417
are the Lands of Fire, Water,
Lightning, Wind, and Earth.

198
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,554
They each occupy
vast territories.

199
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:35,625
Together they are known as the
five great Shinobi nations.

200
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,896
The Land of Fire has the
Village Hidden in the Leaves;

201
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,599
the Land of Water, the
Village Hidden in the Mist;

202
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,167
the Land of Lightning, the
Village Hidden in the Clouds;

203
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,471
the Land of Wind, the
Village Hidden in the Sand;

204
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:51,475
and the Land of Earth, the
Village Hidden in the Stones.

205
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,778
Only the leaders of
these hidden villages

206
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:58,249
are permitted the name
Kage, which means "shadow."

207
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:04,857
Hokage, Mizukage, Raikage,
Kazekage, Tsuchikage-- these

208
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,126
are the leaders,
the five shadows

209
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,462
that reign over
thousands of ninja.

210
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:16,136
--[gasps] Then Lord
Hokage's really important!

211
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:17,337
(VOICEOVER) Hmm.

212
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,040
Is that old man really
such a big deal?

213
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:23,610
I'm not buying it.

214
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:25,946
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I got
him with my <i>senjutsu.</i>

215
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,248
He can't be that great.

216
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:28,482
Believe it.

217
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:28,949
Hmm.

218
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:29,550
-Hey.

219
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,484
-Huh?

220
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:31,618
-Uh--

221
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:33,520
-You all just doubted
Lord Hokage, didn't you?

222
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:34,922
That's what you were thinking.

223
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:35,623
-Uh--

224
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:36,157
-Um--

225
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,991
-Uh--

226
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,261
-No.

227
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:42,630
-Well, anyway, there
are no ninja battles

228
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:46,534
in a C-ranked mission,
so you can relax.

229
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:49,271
-And we're not going to run
into any foreign enemy ninja

230
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:50,873
or anything like that.

help you right away.

I was useless!

And Sasuke was so
cool, like he'd

done this a thousand times.

279
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,541
Didn't he feel scared at all?

280
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:22,180
He looked so calm, not a scratch
on him, and I was so lame.

00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,783
He had to come up and save me!

Ugh!

Why can't I keep up with them?

-Naruto, stand still.

291
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,639
These ninja have
poison in their claws.

00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:48,542
We need to take it
out of you quickly.

KAKASHI: You have to open
the wound and remove it.

It's in your blood,
so don't move around.

297
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,951
That spreads the poison.

298
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:58,820
By the way, Mr. Tazuna,

299
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:02,890
-[grunts] Yeah, what?

300
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:03,791
-We need to talk.

301
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:10,365
They're Chunin from the
Village Hidden in the Mist.

302
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:13,201
Their specialty is
relentless attack.

303
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:16,372
They keep fighting, no
matter what the sacrifice.

304
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:20,243
-How did you know
about our ambush?

305
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:24,647
-A puddle on a clear day, when
it hasn't rained in weeks?

306
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,854
-In that case, why'd you
leave it for the Genin

307
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,422
to do the fighting?

308
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,858
-I could have taken
them out quickly.

309
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:37,427
But then I'd have
learned nothing.

310
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:46,737
I had to know who their target
was, and what they were after.

311
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,738
TAZUNA: Hmm?

312
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:50,508
What are you getting at?

313
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,843
-This.

314
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,046
I wanted to know if they were
after us, ninja attacking

315
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,420
ninja, or if they were after
you, the master bridge builder.

316
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,790
When you put in
your request, you

317
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:08,728
asked for standard protection
from robbers and highway men.

318
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,732
You didn't say there were ninja
looking for you, hunting you

319
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,267
down.

320
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:18,371
If we knew this, it would be
a B-rank mission or higher.

321
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:21,408
Our task was simply to get
you to your destination

322
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,778
and protect you while you
finished building your bridge.

323
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:27,715
If we knew we'd be fielding
attacks from enemy ninja,

324
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,018
we would have staffed
differently and charged

325
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,486
for the cost of a B mission.

326
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,725
Apparently you have your
reasons, but lying to us

327
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,593
is not acceptable.

328
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:42,932
We are now beyond the
scope of this mission.

329
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:44,266
-We are Genin.

330
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,669
This is too advanced for
our level of training.

331
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,671
We should go back.

332
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:50,740
And I really think we need
to treat Naruto's wound

333
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:54,244
and get the poison out
as soon as possible.

334
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,880
Back in our village, we
can take him to a doctor.

335
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:57,480
-Hmm.

336
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:04,020
-Ahh, huh?

337
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:08,292
-Naruto's hand could
become a problem.

338
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:10,928
I guess we should go
back to the village.

339
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:11,896
-Arrrgh!

340
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,464
[grunts]

341
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,705
[gasps]

342
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,283
NARUTO: Why am I so different?

343
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:34,520
Why am I always-- [groan]

344
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:35,188
-Naruto!

345
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:36,022
Stop that!

346
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:38,057
What are you doing?

347
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,458
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I worked so hard

348
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:42,729
to get here, pushing
myself until it hurt,

349
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:46,866
training alone for hours,
anything to get stronger,

350
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,901
to reach my dream.

351
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:56,376
I will never back down again
and let someone else rescue me.

352
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,646
I will never run away.

353
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,716
And I will not lose to Sasuke.

354
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:10,225
Upon this wound, I make
this pledge, believe it.

355
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:13,362
Bridge builder, I'll
complete this mission

356
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:15,664
and protect you with
this kunai knife.

357
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,372
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

358
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:26,208
-Naruto, that was
really cool how

359
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:28,010
you took the poison out and all.

360
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:30,981
But if you lose any more
blood, you're going to die.

361
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:39,490
-[sighing and moaning]

362
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:42,360
-Good idea to stop the
bleeding now, seriously.

363
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:43,927
-Not, not, not!

364
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:45,229
No, no, no!

365
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:47,265
I'm too young for it
to all end like this.

366
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:48,833
No, no, no!

367
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:49,834
-Show me your hand.

368
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:52,203
-No, no, help, no!

369
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,605
No, no!

370
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:57,142
-Naruto, you've got a
self-abusive personality.

371
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,110
It's called masochism.

372
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:09,489
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): The wound,
it's already starting to heal.

373
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:14,995
-Um, um--

374
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,329
-Hmm?

375
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:18,198
-You have a really
serious look on your face.

376
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,232
You're scaring me.

377
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,335
Am I OK?

378
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:25,439
-Uh, yeah, you should be fine.

379
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:27,241
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
This healing power,

380
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,410
is it from the nine-tailed fox?

381
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:31,946
[animal sounds]

382
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,053
-You failed.

383
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,621
You failed?

384
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,323
What is this, amateur night?

385
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,991
I put out big money for you!

386
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,762
I thought you were supposed
to be hotshot assassins.

387
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:48,897
-Stop whining.

388
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:53,102
-[grunts] [moans]

389
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:55,839
-This time, I'll go personally.

390
00:20:55,872 --> 00:21:00,710
And this sword will be the
last thing he ever sees.

391
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:02,746
--[clears throat]
You sure about that?

392
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,150
Apparently Tazuna has a
high-level ninja guarding him.

393
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,052
And since your first
attempt failed,

394
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:10,320
they'll be expecting you back.

395
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,056
They'll be waiting, watching.

396
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:14,525
It'll take someone with
very advanced skills.

397
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,661
-Who do you think
you're dealing with?

398
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:28,540
I am Zabuza Momochi, the
Demon of the Hidden Mist.

399
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:36,616
[theme music]

400
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:07,346
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
We finally land

401
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,082
ashore in the Land of Waves.

402
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,950
The ninja they send
after us now will

403
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,520
be stronger and
deadlier than before.

404
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:14,754
Fine.

405
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:16,089
I'm going to show
them what I can do!

406
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,091
And Sasuke's not going
to show me up, either.

407
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,128
I'll protect the old
man, no matter what.

408
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:22,162
Oh, wow!

409
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:23,463
That's who they sent after us?

410
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:24,431
He's huge!

411
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:26,501
And his sword is gigantic!

412
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:29,704
Next time, the
Assassin of the Mist.

413
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:33,401
No backing down, this time
I'm going all the way!
