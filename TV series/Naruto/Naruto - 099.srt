00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,911
-I want to show I can be as
fun a ninja as well, even if I

3
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:10,278
do not have Ninjutsu
or Genjutsu.

4
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,145
I want to prove it
to the whole world.

5
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:40,045
-All right!

6
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,811
Got a full day of
training ahead.

7
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,311
Ah!

8
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,811
Hey, bushy brow.

9
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,245
How you doin'?

10
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:47,211
-Naruto.

11
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,245
Good morning.

12
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,411
-Morning.

13
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:51,845
So, did Grandma Tsunade
check you out already?

14
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:52,778
-Uh--

15
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,511
-Well, come on,
what did she say?

16
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,611
It's a good thing she came,
'cause you know the village is

17
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,111
in trouble, don'tcha?

18
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:05,178
We're gonna need
every ninja we've got.

19
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:06,045
-Yes.

20
00:03:06,078 --> 00:03:07,345
You are right.

21
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,178
-So you'd better get back
up to full fighting strength

22
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:10,045
as soon as you can,

23
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,145
CHILDREN: Come on, Naruto!

24
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,511
Hurry!

25
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:13,245
-What is it?

26
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:13,945
What's wrong?

27
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,711
-It's Konohamaru.

28
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:16,578
-Huh?

29
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:17,411
What do you mean?

30
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:18,611
What's going on?

31
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,911
-He'd blockaded himself.

32
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:21,845
-Ah?

33
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,211
He's done what?

34
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,145
(VOICEOVER) The Will
of Fire Still Burns.

35
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,111
-That's enough, now.

36
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,211
We don't want to have
to break it down.

37
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,611
KONOHAMARU: Go ahead and try it!

38
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:38,645
See what happens!

39
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,811
I'm the grandson of
the Third Hokage!

40
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:48,011
If you go against me, you're
going against my-- my grandpa.

41
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:51,511
You'll be going
against the Hokage!

42
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:53,345
-Lady Tsunade has
important work to do,

43
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:55,411
and she can't do it
until she gets in there.

44
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:55,911
-Oink.

45
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:56,411
Oink.

00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,778
KONOHAMARU: Pepper smoke bombs.

49
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,311
And you'll get worse
if you try comin' in.

50
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,778
The whole place
is booby trapped!

51
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:19,478
-Honorable Grandson, even you--
[coughing] [sneeze] there are

52
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,411
some things even you
can't get away with.

53
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,478
Now come out of there.

54
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,911
KONOHAMARU: Shut up and go away!

55
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:29,245
-Isn't it a little early
for all this racket?

56
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:30,745
It's giving me a
screaming headache.

57
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:33,345
-Lady Tsunade--

58
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,711
[oinking]

59
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:36,945
-Huh?

60
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:39,545
You two can't handle
one little kid?

61
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,211
-Well--

62
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,611
TSUNADE: Get him out of there.

63
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,045
-But ma'am, he's the
grandson of the Third Hokage.

64
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:50,145
-What do I care?

65
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,011
I'm the granddaughter
of the First Hokage.

66
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,178
I'm the one you need
to worry about now.

67
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,578
From what I can see,
it might do the brat

68
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,345
some good to be
roughed up a little.

69
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:02,045
Now get him out of there.

70
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:02,545
-Right.

71
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:06,145
NARUTO: Wait!

72
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:07,145
Don't!

73
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:07,645
-Naruto?

74
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,378
-Hold on.

75
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,478
Just wait a second.

76
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,511
I don't know exactly
what's going on here,

77
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,578
but don't be too rough
on Konohamaru, huh?

78
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,278
Please, Grandma Tsunade.

79
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,645
-He's a friend of yours, is he?

80
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,678
-Mm-hm.

81
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,645
Don't worry, I can get him out.

82
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:25,645
Just let me talk to him.

83
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:26,711
He'll listen to me.

84
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:30,411
-I want him out of there
by the end of the day.

85
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:31,878
-End of the day?

86
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,745
But-- Lady Tsundade!

87
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:34,245
Wait!

88
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:43,478
-Hello again.

89
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,178
-Oh, hi, Sakura.

90
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,378
Didn't you know that
Sasuke's been discharged?

91
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,378
-I actually came to see Lee.

92
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:53,378
He should be in
rehabilitation, right?

93
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,078
-He hasn't checked in.

94
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:55,911
That's funny.

95
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:58,011
It's not like him to be late.

96
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:59,245
-No, it certainly isn't.

97
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,911
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): The
chances of the operation

98
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,545
being successful
are 50-50 at best.

99
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,745
And if it fails-- he'll die.

100
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,078
-Hey!

101
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,411
Konohamaru!

102
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,545
What are you doing
in there, anyway?

103
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:31,345
[knocking] Hey, I
know what we can do.

104
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:32,678
You want to go get some ramen?

105
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,611
How does that sound?

106
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:39,611
All you can eat, and it's on me!

107
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,445
Steaming hot, with
lots of barbecued pork!

108
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,011
Eggs on top, and
the crunchy things.

109
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,845
Well?

110
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:57,078
Hey, will you at
least say something?

111
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,811
KONOHAMARU: OK.

112
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,111
Shut up and go away!

113
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,645
-No kid's gonna talk
to me like that!

114
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:03,745
That does it.

115
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,945
Get out of there, or
I'm gonna drag you out.

116
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:06,911
KONOHAMARU: Yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:08,345
Just try it!

118
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:09,245
-You little--

119
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:19,411
-You OK, Naruto?

120
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,745
-Lee.

121
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:31,611
There you are.

122
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,178
-Huh?

123
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:33,711
Oh.

124
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,311
Hi, Sakura.

125
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:37,311
-These are for you.

126
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,745
-For-- for me?

127
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,045
Really?

128
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:47,845
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,811
Ah!

130
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,245
Ah-- sorry about that, Sakura.

131
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:54,478
-No sweat.

132
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:55,145
-Did you hear?

133
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,111
Sasuke's at home now.

134
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:59,045
He's recovering
nicely, and they say

135
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,778
he'll be back to his
old self in no time.

136
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:04,145
All thanks to Lady Tsunade.

137
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:05,911
-I am glad to hear it.

138
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,345
That is good news for everyone.

139
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:10,745
-She's everything
they say she is.

140
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,878
You should have her
take a look at you.

141
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,178
I'm sure she could help
you speed up your recovery.

142
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,678
-Ah-- could be.

143
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,411
-Meanwhile, if there's ever
anything I can do to help,

144
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,411
you know you only
have to ask me, OK?

145
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:31,345
-I appreciate that.

146
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,178
Thank you, Sakura.

147
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:33,811
-Kay, then.

148
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:34,878
See you later.

149
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,178
-Look at this place.

150
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:51,445
Not a single gambling
hall anywhere.

151
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:53,711
-Well, you don't have
time for that, anyway.

152
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,211
There's an awful lot of
work waiting to be done.

153
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,578
-Nowhere to gamble.

154
00:08:57,611 --> 00:08:58,978
Or get a drink.

155
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,445
What a boring little
dump, the Leaf village is.

156
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:03,511
It's no fun at all.

157
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,378
Just like the Third Hokage.

158
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,411
-Lady Tsunade!

159
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:09,011
-I'm exhausted.

160
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:12,078
I just want to sit down
and have a drink somewhere.

161
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,345
Is that too much to ask?

162
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:17,278
Huh?

163
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,478
-If that's what you want, if
it's absolutely necessary,

164
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:23,311
I'll find you a place where you
can have a drink, all right?

165
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:23,978
-Really?

166
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:25,111
-Oink?

167
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:27,778
-But only if you
promise to get to work.

168
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:36,978
[groan]

169
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:37,911
-Go ahead.

170
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,645
You wanted a drink, so go on.

171
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,978
Have a drink.

172
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:47,345
-Look, Shizune, a cup of tea
wasn't exactly what I meant.

173
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,478
-Oh, I know what you
meant, all right.

174
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,578
I think sometimes I know you
better than you know yourself.

175
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,411
-What does that mean?

176
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:57,011
-Part of you was relieved you
couldn't get into the Hokage's

177
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,478
rooms because it
meant you wouldn't

178
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,245
have to do any work, right?

179
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:01,945
That's why you
left it to Naruto,

180
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,811
hoping you'd get a day off.

181
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:04,745
-Hm.

182
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,078
Maybe.

183
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:09,845
-Anyway, here is the updated
roster of the newest ninja.

184
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:11,111
You should really go over it.

185
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,945
There have been a lot
of changes in personnel.

186
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:16,078
You'll need to familiarize
yourself with them.

187
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,511
You have a lot of work to do.

188
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:19,378
-Hm.

189
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,711
It's all such a bore.

190
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,311
-Look, they have
sweet dumplings.

191
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:25,878
-You know those
things make me gag.

192
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,711
-Hey, come on, Konohamaru.

193
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:31,511
Come on out of there
already, will ya?

194
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,711
At least tell me why
you're doing this.

195
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:36,578
Maybe if I had a
clue, I could help.

196
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:37,511
-Please, Konohamaru?

197
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:41,245
-All right, then.

198
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,045
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

199
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:46,445
I tried to be sympathetic, but
I can see it's not working.

200
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,511
Secret Technique, Sexy Jutsu!

201
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:57,945
-Konohamaru, won't
you please come out?

202
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,878
don't keep me waiting.

203
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,345
Won't you come out, huh?

204
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:09,378
Ah-- come on!

205
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,711
Aren't you even gonna
say something, at least?

206
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,611
You want me to freeze
to death out here?

207
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:15,911
Now I'm angry.

208
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:16,811
That does it.

209
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:20,345
Time for Shadow Clone Jutsu!

210
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:22,178
-OK, Konohamaru.

211
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,445
We're comin' in!

212
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:25,878
1, 2, 3!

213
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:33,811
[coughing]

214
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:36,078
-Shoulda seen that
comin', I guess.

215
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,611
GIRL: Naruto, are you OK?

216
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:38,545
NARUTO: Yeah.

217
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,378
Except for feelin'
like an idiot.

218
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,478
-You can forget it.

219
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:43,878
This room belonged
to my grandpa.

220
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,211
No one gets in.

221
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,153
-Hm.

222
00:11:56,187 --> 00:12:00,220
Eight D rank missions,
three C rank missions.

223
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,153
Exactly like Kurenai's own team.

224
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,353
It's not hard to see with the
Third Hokage was thinking.

225
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,853
This squad is a mirror image
of their parents' team.

226
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,087
-I see.

227
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,087
Oh.

228
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Look how well balanced
this squad is.

229
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,287
Each member with his
or her own specialty.

230
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,053
[sigh]

231
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:48,687
-My neck's getting stiff.

232
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,853
I need some fresh air.

233
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:16,520
-Success.

234
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:22,520
Success.

235
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,387
-What are you gonna do now?

236
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,720
-You stubborn
little-- OK, if that's

237
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:43,153
the way you want
to play it, then

238
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:44,620
that's the way
we're gonna play it!

239
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:46,453
KONOHAMARU: This is the
Third Hokage's room.

240
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,420
Nobody uses it except him!

241
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,620
-Hm?

242
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,953
So that's it.

243
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:53,887
-I'm his grandson.

244
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,720
It's my duty to defend it.

245
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:56,653
-Hey, you little runt!

246
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,053
This is no time for that!

247
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,053
We're in danger.

248
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,387
It's the village
that needs defending!

249
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,587
-So what?

250
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,320
This stupid village can
burn down for all I care!

251
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:05,087
-That does it!

252
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,087
You just crossed the line!

253
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,053
Now I've officially had it.

254
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,387
Game's over, kid.

255
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,087
With my new powers, I can
easily blast those doors down.

256
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,920
Though I was hoping
not to have to use 'em.

257
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:17,887
-Naruto, watch out!

258
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,787
-Ah!

259
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Grandma Tsunade.

260
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:23,353
Wait.

261
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,220
Be careful!

262
00:14:58,953 --> 00:14:59,420
-Ah!

263
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,287
Huh?

264
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,887
-So here's the
thing, Konohamaru.

265
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,153
The village is in a lot
of trouble right now.

266
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,853
We've got to pull
together, because we're

267
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,587
down to less than
half our strength,

268
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,887
and we've still got
missions to perform.

269
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,887
-Yeah, yeah.

270
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,320
In case you've
forgotten, I'm the one

271
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:51,420
who told you that, remember?

272
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:52,353
-Oh, well.

273
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,720
OK.

274
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,053
But you see, the point is we
can't turn down any missions,

275
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,353
because that would just be
telling the world how weak we

276
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:00,587
are, and bring us
even more trouble.

277
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,687
-Yeah, and Iruka-sensei
already told us that, too.

278
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,987
I got it.

279
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:11,253
-What is it?

280
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,453
Is it that you don't
like Grandma Tsunade?

281
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:14,353
-No, no.

282
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:16,520
That's not it at all.

283
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:18,820
-Well then, what's it all about?

284
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,420
-Pretty soon, nobody's going
to call me Honorable Grandson

285
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:22,687
anymore.

286
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,653
I'll just be plain Konohamaru.

287
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:26,687
-Huh?

288
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,653
What's wrong with
plain Konohamaru?

289
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,453
-You don't get it.

290
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,187
-What do you mean?

291
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,220
I thought you always hated
being called Honorable Grandson.

292
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,020
-Pretty soon, everyone's
going to start

293
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,853
to forget about the old man.

294
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,187
-Huh?

295
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,153
-It won't be long.

296
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,120
They'll forget what
a great ninja he was,

297
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,953
and then they'll just
toss him into the back

298
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:51,153
of the closet like an old shoe.

299
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:53,020
Everything's changing so fast.

300
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,487
The village isn't
the same anymore.

301
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,353
-But it's still
the Leaf village.

302
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,220
That much will never change.

303
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,187
And you're crazy to
think that anybody's ever

304
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,420
going to forget
about the old man.

305
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:06,087
He'll be remembered
long after we're gone!

306
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,720
-They'll forget him.

307
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:08,887
Just wait.

308
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,087
-I'm saying they won't!

309
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,187
-Well, you're wrong!

310
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,020
-Oh, is that right?

311
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:13,587
What makes you so smart?

312
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,787
How do you know I'm wrong?

313
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,787
-'Cause you are.

314
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,720
-Argh!

315
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,120
I've had it with you!

316
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:20,220
You're coming with me!

317
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,153
-Where?

318
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,487
-First we'll go
to Grandma Tsunade

319
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,020
and make her swear an oath that
the Leaf village will never

320
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,020
change.

321
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:27,387
Then we'll get
everyone in the village

322
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,720
to promise they'll never forget
the old man, no matter what.

323
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,053
That ought to satisfy you, huh?

324
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,953
-Oink.

325
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:42,820
SHIZUNE (VOICEOVER): I
should have never let her out

326
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,087
of my sight for a minute.

327
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,587
-Oink!

328
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,187
-Lead me to her, Tonton!

329
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,220
-Revitalizing the
cellular structure.

330
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:09,720
Huh.

331
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,787
-Oink.

332
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,687
Oink.

333
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,587
-Ah-ha.

334
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,687
So there you are.

335
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,520
We caught you.

336
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:21,020
-Shh.

337
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:27,853
-Lady Tsunade, are
you actually studying?

338
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,087
-Oink!

339
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,620
-Be quiet, will you?

340
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm trying to concentrate here.

341
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,287
[scream]

342
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,720
-What did you say?

343
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:38,220
You've never concentrated
on anything but gambling!

344
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:38,720
I

345
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:39,620
-Huh?

346
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,520
That sounded like Shizune.

347
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,920
-Oh, just calm down.

348
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:48,687
I was thinking about that
medical ninja, Kabuto.

349
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,353
Remember?

350
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,653
-Um, what about him?

351
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:55,453
-Specifically his body's
ability to create new cells.

352
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:59,587
If I could apply that
technique to a patient--

353
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,920
-You mean Rock Lee, don't you?

354
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:06,420
-Even if it only increases
his chances from 50% to 51%,

355
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,653
I think it may be worth a try.

356
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,553
-Lady Tsunade, the
success of that technique

357
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:13,320
depends so much on
the person doing it.

358
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,020
There's no guarantee that
you'd be able to pull it off.

359
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,120
-Only one way to find out.

360
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:26,320
I mean, I am the Fifth
Hokage, after all.

361
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:36,620
-There's no way out
of it, Konohamaru.

362
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,020
I must go.

363
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,953
I am the Third
Hokage, after all.

364
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:45,853
-If that's what it means
to be Hokage, then quit.

365
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:48,687
-Everyone in this
village is family to me.

366
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,220
Protecting the family.

367
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:51,953
That's what it
means to be Hokage.

368
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,687
-Ah-- wait.

369
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,187
Grandpa!

370
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,587
-Just this once.

371
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,053
I'll make an exception.

372
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,487
-Where are we going, Konohamaru?

373
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,487
What's the matter?

374
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,153
Don't you want to
see Grandma Tsunade?

375
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:23,653
-Nope.

376
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,653
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): I mean, I
am the Fifth Hokage, after all.

377
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:38,020
THIRD HOKAGE
(VOICEOVER): There's

378
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:40,587
no way out of it, Konohamaru.

379
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,420
I am the Third
Hokage, after all.

380
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,453
-There's no way out of it.

381
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm the Honorable
Grandson, after all.

382
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:50,420
-Huh?

383
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:54,153
-I mean, I'm Konohamaru
of the Leaf village!

384
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,153
-Hey!

385
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,353
Uh, where are you goin'?

386
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:57,787
Wait up, Konohamaru!

387
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,287
What the heck's gotten into him?

388
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,820
Hey!

389
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:00,287
Konohamaru!

390
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:09,853
-What is it, Lady Tsunade?

391
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:10,853
-Oh, nothing.

392
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:36,910

ROCK LEE: From the
very beginning,

394
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,586
Guy-sensei taught me that I
could become a great ninja

395
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,853
through effort, experience,
and the power of youth.

396
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,786
Before I met him, I was lost.

397
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:14,953
But he showed me a
new path to follow.

398
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:17,553
A journey of hard work and great
struggle that would take me

399
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:19,986
to a destination I
had never dreamed of.

400
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:21,719
He made me believe.

401
00:23:21,753 --> 00:23:22,753
But now--

402
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:25,919
NARUTO: Next time,
Sensei and Student,

403
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:26,986
the Bond of the Shinobi.
