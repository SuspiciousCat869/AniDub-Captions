2
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:52,369
-TSUNADE: Ah.

3
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:55,035
This is so relaxing.

4
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,669
Peace time is such
a wonderful thing.

5
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:01,569
I can just sit here drinking
as much sake as I want to.

6
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:12,535
-This is not the time to be
loafing around getting drunk!

7
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,502
It's so rare when the
village is at peace.

8
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,902
You should use this time
to do your paperwork!

9
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,135
-Why does it seem like no
matter how much paperwork I

10
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,569
do, there's always more?

11
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:25,202
-Because you never see a single
item through to completion,

12
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,669
Lady Tsunade!

13
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:30,302
-There's unrest brewing
among the Kamizuru Clan?

14
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,902
-That's a communique from
the ANBU unit stationed

15
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,302
in the Land of Earth.

16
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,902
Though Kamizuru
doesn't sound familiar.

17
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:39,869
-The Kamizuru Clan were the
legendary insect-handlers

18
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:41,902
of the Hidden Stone Village.

19
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:43,802
Long ago, they
were so well known

20
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:47,602
many considered them
equals of the Aburame Clan.

21
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,935
But over the years, they've
practically died out.

22
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,702
These days, hardly anyone
even remembers their name.

23
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:56,669
-I've never heard
of them before.

24
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,135
-Well, this says they
might cause some trouble.

25
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,702
But there aren't too
many of them left.

26
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,935
I don't think it's anything
we need to worry about it.

27
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:09,169
NARUTO: What's the difference?

28
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,569
Don't all insects look alike?

29
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,369
This is crazy.

30
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:19,202
There's so many
insects around here.

31
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:21,669
-This whole forest is
like a bug paradise.

32
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,469
-There's no chance we
can get stung, is there?

33
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:27,335
-Almost none of these
insects can harm humans.

34
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:29,802
But just in case, I
have the Aburame Clan's

35
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,435
secret repellent.

36
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,969
Though I would
prefer not to use it,

37
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,102
since it would also
repel the bikochu.

38
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,235
-Great.

39
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,602
Then what's the point of
even bringing it along?

40
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,202
-Just as I thought.

41
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,135
That kid in the
lead is definitely

42
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,535
a member of the Aburame Clan.

43
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,602
I never thought we'd
bump into one of them

44
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:59,369
in a place like this.

45
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:02,469
-Do you think they're after
the bikochu just like we are?

46
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,902
Huh, Jibachi?

47
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,502
-Well, if someone
wanted the bikochu,

48
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:08,502
they would have to come
to this exact place

49
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:09,969
at this time of year.

50
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:10,935
-Remember.

51
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,602
The fate of the
whole Kamizuru Clan

52
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,969
rests on the outcome
of our mission.

53
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,669
No matter who stands in our
way, we must get that bikochu.

54
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,902
SHINO: This is the
female bikochu.

55
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:28,535
Remember it down to
the smallest detail.

56
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,402
-No problem.

57
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:29,902
-OK.

58
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,269
Got it.

59
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:32,102
-Hey.

60
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:34,702
You know, I've seen one before.

61
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:35,435
-You've seen it?

62
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:36,302
Are you sure?

63
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:39,169
-Where did you see one, Naruto?

64
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:43,702
-Well, uh-- one
time, I accidentally

65
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:47,502
left some food out, and they
started coming out of nowhere.

66
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,635
A whole bunch of 'em everywhere.

67
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:51,569
So those were bikochu.

68
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:58,102
Those things should be
easy for us to catch.

69
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:59,835
-You're kidding me.

70
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,035
-Um-- Naruto--

71
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:01,835
-No.

72
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,469
Those were just cockroaches.

73
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,335
-Eh?

74
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,435
Cockroaches?

75
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:08,502
-They're not remotely the same.

76
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:09,469
-Come on.

77
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:12,802
This bug is
completely different.

78
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:13,702
-I don't know.

79
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:15,269
They look the same to me.

80
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:16,202
-Well, they're not!

81
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:24,169
-Coming across these guys might
be the good fortune we needed.

82
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,369
-What are you talking
about, Suzumebachi?

83
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:29,802
-It's been ten days since
we started our search team,

84
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:33,169
and we haven't even found
a trace of the bikochu.

85
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:35,769
But if that kid from
the Aburame Clan does--

86
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,335
-Yes.

87
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,369
You're right.

88
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:38,769
But do you actually
think those three

89
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:40,269
kids could catch a bikochu?

90
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:41,969
-I can't be sure.

91
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,269
All of them appear
to be merely genin.

92
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,069
If they do manage
to catch one though,

93
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:49,769
we'll be waiting right here
to take it away from them.

94
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,802
-Ah, man.

95
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:57,469
All these insects
look totally alike.

96
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:02,802
-Insect Summoning Jutsu.

97
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:17,269
No.

98
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:17,769
None here.

99
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,235
-Is this it?

100
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,169
Ah, it's different.

101
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,002
[bark]

102
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,335
-Heheh.

103
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,402
-Try not to be a burden
to those around you,

104
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:04,269
if you're able to help it.

HINATA (VOICEOVER):
This mission,

106
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,635
I'm the one who
volunteered us for it.

107
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,402
I've got to find that beetle.

108
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:10,902
Byakugan!

109
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:22,769
-Oh no.

110
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,702
I can't sense things
as small as insects.

111
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:30,602
Huh?

112
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,469
-Hm?

113
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,969
-Shino, Kiba!

114
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,669
-Hinata, did you see them too?

115
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:44,502
-Oh.

116
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:46,435
You already know.

117
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,302
-They must not know
we're aware of them.

118
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,402
-Unfortunately for them,
almost our entire team

119
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,435
are specialists in
detecting hidden enemies.

120
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:56,902
What should we do, Shino?

121
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,569
After all, you are the
leader of this mission.

122
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:01,335
-If it comes to a
fight, the insects

123
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,469
may get caught in the
middle, and there'd

124
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:06,269
be a danger of
injuring the bikochu.

125
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,135
As long as they
don't make a move,

126
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,802
let's just keep an eye on 'em.

127
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:10,935
-All right.

128
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:14,135
-I wonder if Naruto
noticed them.

129
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:17,135
-If he did, he'd be yelling
and screaming by now.

130
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,969
-Let's not stir things up.

131
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,635
Don't tell him.

132
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,135
NARUTO: Hey!

133
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,069
Shino!

134
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:23,835
Shino!

135
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:24,702
I found one!

136
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,502
I found one!

137
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:27,469
I'm telling you!

138
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:28,969
I found a bikochu!

139
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,902
[gasping]

140
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,402
-He found one already?

141
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:37,335
-Impossible!

142
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:38,335
-When we spent
ten days searching

143
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,802
and couldn't find one?

144
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:40,802
No way.

145
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:41,702
-Oh, Naruto.

146
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:43,102
You did it.

147
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:44,802
-Are you positive?

148
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:45,935
Cuz last time--

149
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,102
-I wanna see it.

150
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,969
[giggling]

151
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,502
-Well, this is the bug, right?

152
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,035
See?

153
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,102
It's exactly like that
photo you showed us.

154
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:01,235
Guess I must be some sort
of insect hunting genius.

155
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:02,135
Huh?

156
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,502
-Does it look the same to you?

157
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:06,002
-Uh.

158
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,435
Uh.

159
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:08,469
Uh.

160
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:11,502
-The one you have
is a goliath beetle.

161
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:12,202
-Ah!

162
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,002
It's not the same thing!

163
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,135
-The bikochu isn't
active at night.

164
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,235
-So--

165
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,469
-I suppose we might

Yo!

Shino!

169
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:31,602
I spotted one!

170
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:34,035
This time I'm 100%
certain of it.

171
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,869
-It's probably a completely
different insect.

Over here.

Hurry.

00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:52,669
If we don't get there
quick it'll fly away.

00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:53,835
KIBA: So why didn't you
just bring it with you

179
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:54,869
in the first place?

resting in a tree.

181
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:08,135
-The shape of the antennae
is certainly the same,

182
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,269
and all the
characteristics match.

183
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:11,335
-See?

184
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,702
I knew I'd found the
right one this time.

-But-- um-- Naruto--

-I'm pretty sure this
is a different insect.

187
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:18,669
-Huh?

188
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,702
What makes you say that?

189
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,302
KIBA: It's way too
big to be our bug!

190
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:24,402
How would you ever get this one
to sniff out scents, you dummy!

191
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,235
-That's easy.

192
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,135
I can handle him!

193
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,369
-I should warn you.

194
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:30,335
It's quite ill-tempered.

195
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:33,869
That species gets angry if
anyone touches its nose.

196
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:35,935
And they've been
known to eat humans.

197
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:36,469
-What?

198
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:39,835
Heheh.

there were no dangerous insects

Not zero.

-Kurobachi, Jibachi, I am
beginning to seriously doubt

206
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:24,669
those guys will ever
catch a bikochu.

207
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:25,702
-I think you're right.

208
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,116
HINATA (VOICEOVER): If I'm
going to locate something

209
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:56,016
as small as an insect, I need
to focus my chakra better.

210
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,349
SUZUMEBACHI (VOICEOVER): Hmph.

00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,183
Way out in the middle of nowhere

That's admirable.

213
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,849
SHINO: The air
pressure changed, which

214
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:47,216
means the weather is shifting.

215

-I felt it too.

216
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:53,749
There's a breeze now, and
it's getting more humid.

217
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:56,349
No doubt it's about to rain.

218
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:57,249
-Huh?

219
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,183
Aw.

220
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,849
But the weather's perfect.

221
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:00,783
HINATA: No.

222
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,283
I sense clouds off
in the distance.

223
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,416
-We need to find those beetles.

224
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:12,283
You see, the bikochu only
lay their eggs when it rains.

225
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:16,349
They mature quickly, and the
following morning the larvae

226
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,149
emerge from the egg.

227
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:21,216
-In other words,
if it rains today,

228
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,583
they'll be fully
grown by tomorrow.

229
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,083
-It's the end of the season.

230
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,116
This may be our last chance.

231
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,049
If we let them slip
through our fingers,

232
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,016
it won't be possible
to search for Sasuke.

233
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:32,949
-That can't happen.

234
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,549
We can do it.

235
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,683
I'll find one of those
bugs no matter what.

236

Come on.

You've gotta come
out before it rains.

are we gonna do

243
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,316
if these guys don't end
up finding a bikochu?

00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:28,516
-Remember.

245
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,583
The Aburame Clan was
responsible for the downfall

246
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,783
of our proud Kamizuru Clan.

247
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:34,349
SUZUMEBACHI (VOICEOVER):
We'll finally

248
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:38,183
get revenge for our clan
by taking out an Aburame.

249
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,649
-Those tag-alongs,
I'm worried they still

250
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:48,283
haven't made a move on us.

251
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,816
-They must have
figured out that we're

252
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:53,283
searching for the bikochu,
which means they're just keeping

253
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:56,183
their distance waiting
for us to find one.

254

-Oh.

00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:57,816
I get it.

256
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,149
So their plan is to wait
until we discover one,

257
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:02,883
then steal it from us.

258
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,416

their own beetle.

Not this one either.

to rain yet, darn it!

-Try not to be a burden
to those around you,

if you're able to help it.

There's still a chance.

I won't break it.

That's what my ninja
way is all about.

00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,016
The mission was my idea.

00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,516
I'm responsible.

It might actually be
to your advantage.

-What do mean, Shino?

282
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:22,283
-Think about it.

283
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,383
When the surrounding
temperature cools,

284
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,016
it's easier to see the heat
signature of living creatures.

285

I'm not giving up either.

00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:34,749
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Sasuke,
nothing's gonna stop me.

332
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:36,483
I will find you.

333
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:44,216
-Heh.

334
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,316
It looks like they
finally found one.

335
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,083
-Meaning the time has come.

336
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:48,549
-Let's go.

337
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:01,049
-Naruto, he-- all of a sudden
he pressed his face so close

338
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,016
to mine and I--

339
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:08,583
-Nice.

340
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:12,916
You were able to dodge my kunai.

341
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,549
-Pretty nimble
moves for a genin.

342
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,683
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

343
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:18,583
They must be the ones
who've been following us

344
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,783
all this time.

345
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:23,683
-But let's find out if
you can evade this attack.

346
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:26,716
Ninja Art Honeybee Jutsu!

347
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,216
-No!

348
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,216
Not bees!

349
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,516
No!

350
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:42,016
Can't--

351
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,649
-So you noticed, huh?

352
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,383
My special honey.

353
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,516
You can't escape.

354
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:50,916
It's far too strong!

355
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,316
-I used up all my
chakra earlier.

356
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:06,716
-I'm afraid this bee
has quite a sting.

357
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:10,116
-Naruto.

358
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:23,383
-Do you smell anything, buddy?

359
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,116
[whimper]

360
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:26,116
-Nothing.

361
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,416
I thought for sure
that those others

362
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,716
would make some kind
of move on us by now.

363
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:31,849
But there hasn't been
any sign of them yet.

364
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:36,549
-There's a possibility that
we overlooked something.

365
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,049
-Hey, Naruto.

366
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:38,616
-Hm?

367
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:39,683
-Where's Hinata?

368
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,849
-She went to go wash her face.

369
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,049
-Huh?

370
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:43,816
-Yeah.

371
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,183
But it's been a while now.

372
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:47,549
I wonder what's
taking her so long.

373
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,816
-Oh no.

374
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:49,316
-Huh?

375
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,816
What's up?

376
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,316
-Naruto!

377
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:51,816
Down!

378
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,283
SHINO: There's a note.

379
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:03,349
KUROBACHI: We're holding
the kunoichi brat hostage.

380
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,049
If you want to get
her back, we'll

381
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,749
trade her for the bikochu.

382
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:10,183
Bring it to the top of the
eastern hill at midnight.

383
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:10,949
-Darn it.

384
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,516
I knew they'd make a move.

385
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:14,451
-Hinata.

386
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:41,133
[theme music]

387
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,333
NARUTO: There's
nothing else we can do.

388
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,833
SHINO: It's too
early to give up.

389
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:09,100
KIBA: But we don't even
know where Hinata is.

390
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,366
SHINO: No.

391
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,666
There's still one place we
can try to recover Hinata.

392
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,800
KIBA: You mean at the
exchange for the bikochu?

393
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,100
SHINO: It's our only chance.

394
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,966
NARUTO: I've gotta rescue
Hinata, and protect

395
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,466
the bikochu.

396
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,400
I can't fail on this.

397
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,866
Next time-- A Battle of Bugs.

398
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,400
The Deceivers and the Deceived.
