-This training by myself--
I just can't get into it.

3
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,177
Pervy sage.

4
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,480
Where the heck did you
run off to, anyway?

5
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,782
Weren't you supposed to
help me train or something?

6
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,717
Man, I hate this.

7
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,185
Darn it!

8
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:36,490
Huh?

9
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,200
What's she doing?

10
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,650
Wow.

11
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,685
You're really good.

12
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,126
Huh?

13
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,833
Wait a minute.

14
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,001
There's no rain clouds today.

00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:30,911

00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,850
What are you waiting for?

19
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,785
We need water now.

20
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,719
-Yes, ma'am.

25
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,698
-Sorry, Lady Tsunade.

26
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,137
-That's good.

27
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,638
Keep it up!

28
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,105
-Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,450
It's as I thought.

30
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,119
My worst fears
have come to pass.

31
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,067
-There she is.

32
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,401
Hey!

33
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,002
Wait up, will ya?

34
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,045
-Hold her still.

35
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,118
-You had to go and make trouble.

36
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,454
-We should get her
back right away.

37
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,188
-Right.

38
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,689
-Hey, hold on!

39
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,991
What do you guys
think you're doing?

40
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,626
Get your hands off her!

-Naruto Uzumaki.

43
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,933
You need to leave
this area immediately.

44
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,704
-But what are you
doing with that girl?

45
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,672
What did she do?

46
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,507
-It doesn't concern you.

47
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,675
Now get going.

48
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,611
You're not to breathe a
word of what you saw here.

49
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,912
-Wait a minute!

50
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,781
You need to tell me
what you're doing.

51
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,016
-Don't try to interfere.

52
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,756
-They just vanished.

53
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,890
How weird.

54
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,692
I wonder what that
was all about.

55
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,431
-All these important
documents are soaked.

56
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,733
-We'll have to put
them in the sun to dry.

57
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,669
-I'll take them outside
and get started.

58
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,436
-Thank you.

59
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,107
-Good morning.

60
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,476
-Good morning, Kurenai-sensei.

61
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,544
-Is she in there?

62
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,011
-Yes.

63
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,117
-So you're serious about this?

64
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,721
You really want to resign
as leader of squad eight?

65
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,422
-Yes, ma'am.

66
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,534
-Think carefully about this.

67
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,070
Kiba, Shibo, Hinata--
you're the one

68
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,771
who recommended
they take the chunin

69
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,007
exam despite their
lack of experience.

70
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,409
Don't you care about
what happens to them?

71
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,011
-Despite my commitment
to them I am

72
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,846
responsible for the
current situation,

73
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,716
and therefore must
accept full blame.

74
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,585
-The incident was unfortunate,
but it wasn't your fault.

75
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,495
-You'd never know it
by looking at her,

76
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,765
but if the Anbu black ops were
involved she must be dangerous.

77
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,200
Or maybe something
really bad happened

78
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,769
and she's just mixed
up with it somehow.

79
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,037
[barking]

80
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,772
KIBA: What was that you said?

81
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,907
GIRL: Kiba, calm down.

82
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,778
-What's going on over there?

83
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,846
-Go ahead, Shino.

84
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,714
I dare you to say that again.

85
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:28,815
-All right.

86
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,417
I said it's pointless.

87
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,652
-I can't believe you would
say something like that.

88
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,623
-Cool it, you guys.

89
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,125
-Naruto.

90
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:38,892
-Come on.

91
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,960
Take it easy, will ya?

92
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,628
What the heck's going on?

93
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,964
-Kurenai left us swinging in the
wind, that's what's going on.

94
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,600
She just abandoned squad eight.

95
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,734
-Huh?

96
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,136
She wouldn't do
something like that.

97
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,105
-She just called us together
a few minutes ago and told us.

98
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,511
-I have fulfilled my obligation.

99
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,946
I'm sure they'll try to find
another chief jonin to take

100
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,982
my place as soon as possible.

101
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,150
-But you're our sensei.

102
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,885
You can't just
leave us like this.

103
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,052
-We need you.

104
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,121
-The decision's
already been made.

105
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,856
Our relationship
has always been that

106
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,159
of commander and
subordinates, that's all.

107
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,895
Someone will fill my role
and the squad will continue.

108
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,731
It's as simple as that.

109
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,499
-She never gave a reason.

110
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,867
Just walked away.

111
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,135
-She didn't say anything?

112
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,937
And you guys are just
gonna accept that?

113
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,439
-Not a chance!

114
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,940
We're not like
some little insects

115
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,175
that can be pushed around.

116
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,510
So I say we march into
the Hokage's office

117
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,847
and demand to know why Kurenai's
being removed from squad eight.

118
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,649
I say it's our only shot.

119
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,117
-And I say it's pointless.

120
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,986
She said herself that the
Hokage hadn't removed her.

121
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,622
She's the one who made
the decision to step down.

122
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,657
-Yeah?

123
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,592
I don't believe it for a second.

124
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,593
What about you, Hinata?

125
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,794
What do you think?

126
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,162
-Well, it's difficult.

127
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,932
Because even though I want
Kurenai to stay our jonin,

128
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:52,866
it's just--

129
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,000
-It's just what?

130
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,569
What's the problem?

131
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,838
-Maybe she has her own
reasons for wanting to do this

132
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,106
and we shouldn't get involved.

133
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,875
I think.

134
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,478
-So you're siding with
Shino on this, huh?

135
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,111
-No.

136
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,580
I'm not siding with anyone--

137
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,681
-Come on, guys.

138
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,115
Shut up and stop
fighting already.

139
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,551
You guys just relax
and let me handle this.

140
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,621
-He's not even on this team,
so why should we let him do it?

141
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,655
-Have you got a plan?

142
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,724
-Of course I've got a plan.

143
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,025
Just leave it to me.

144
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,727
She'll be back in charge
of squad eight in no time.

145
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,004
Why do I say I've
got a plan when

146
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,640
I have no idea what I'm doing?

147
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,107
Huh?

148
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,879
It's Kurenai-sensei.

149
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,048
I wonder what she's thinking.

150
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,717
Well, the only
way to find out is

151
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,552
to go up and ask
her face to face.

152
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,692
Uh, sensei?

153
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,960
-Naruto.

154
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,663
-Kiba, Hinata and Shino
told me what happened.

155
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,931
-And?

156
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,199
-And you shouldn't leave
them after everything

157
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,901
you've been through together.

158
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,969
They don't know what they're
gonna do without you.

159
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,105
-You ran up here
to tell me that?

160
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,439
-Well, yeah.

161
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,574
You're their sensei.

162
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,910
They look up to you.

163
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,711
-I don't know exactly
what they told you,

164
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,947
but I can no longer
be their sensei.

165
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,450
I don't deserve to
carry that title now.

166
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,885
-Why don't you?

167
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,987
-I have a message I
want you to deliver.

168
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,823
Tell them that I'm
never coming back.

169
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,457
-Sensei.

170
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,962
What can I do?

171
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,498
It's like she didn't hear
a single word I said.

172
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,733
I guess there's nothing
left to do but go talk

173
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,101
to Grandma Tsunade herself.

174
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,415
-Naruto.

175
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:48,930
-Oh.

176
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,983
Hey, Sakura.

177
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,685
-What are you doing here?

178
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,120
-I don't know if you heard, but
Kurenai's quitting squad eight.

179
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,557
So I came to see if I could
convince Grandma Tsunade to try

180
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,692
and talk her out of it.

181
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,460
-Don't think you'll
have any luck.

182
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,461
You can try.

183
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,596
-Oh, don't worry.

184
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,064
I know the place where she
keeps her booze hidden.

185
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,132
So all I gotta do is
threaten to tell Shizune

186
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,702
and she'll be putty in my hands.

187
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,170
-But you never know.

188
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,606
She might have had a good reason
for wanting to quit the squad.

189
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,607
-Like what?

190
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,641
Wait a minute.

191
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,810
You know something, don't you?

192
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,578
I can see it in your eyes.

193
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,614
You know something!

194
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,848
-What are you talking about?

195
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,816
I don't know anything.

196
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,883
-Come on, Sakura, tell me.

197
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:24,851
I know you know.

198
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,986
-No way.

199
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,120
What do you think,
I stand around

200
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,121
with my ear against
a door listening

201
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,456
to important conversations?

202
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,490
-You didn't!

203
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,760
You were eavesdropping
at the door?

204
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,828
-Shh!

205
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,996
Don't talk so loud, you idiot.

206
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:36,930
Someone'll hear!

207
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,738
-Yakumo?

208
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,872
-Yeah.

209
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm pretty sure
that's who she said.

210
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,710
-It's my fault.

211
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm the one who allowed Yakumo
to become the way she is.

212
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,582
-I'd say that the only
reason she's done so well

213
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:58,785
up to this point is because
of your influence on her.

214
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,719
Where is she now?

215
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,154
What's her status?

216
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,024
-A three-man squad consisting
of two medical ninja and one

217
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,560
Anbu black ops member is
keeping a 24-hour watch over her

218
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,930
in a mountain villa just
outside of Satomi Hill.

219
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,632
-The situation's been handled.

220
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,700
Isn't that enough?

221
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,901
-No.

222
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,004
I must be held accountable
for my actions.

223
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,140
-That explains what
was going on earlier.

224
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:27,447
Sounds just like
those four people.

225
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,449
And what did you say
her name was, again?

226
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,150
I forgot.

227
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,484
-Yakumo.

228
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,152
-Yakumo.

229
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:32,786
Right.

230
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,454
Thanks, Sakura.

231
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,923
-Remember, if someone asks,
you didn't hear any of this

232
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:37,891
from me, OK?

233
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,658
-Yeah, yeah.

234
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,141
Whatever!

235
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,834
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): If
that girl I saw is Yakumo

236
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,102
then she might know
something about what's

237
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,570
going on with Kurenai-sensei.

238
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,501
-You're not quite there yet.

239
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,139
-Kurenai Yuhi.

240
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:40,020
I am requesting this because
you are the most skilled ninja

241
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,154
in the art of genjutsu.

242
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,465
I would like you to take this
young girl under your wing

243
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,302
and give her guidance.

244
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,537
-Who is she?

245
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,506
-Yakumo Kurama.

246
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,076
I'm sure you've heard
about the Kurama clan.

247
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,311
-Yes.

248
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,013
-At one time their
mastery of Genjutsu

249
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,450
was such that it made them a
driving force in the Hidden

250
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,621
Leaf Village, much the
same as the Uchiaha clan.

251
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,589
But in recent years
their influence

252
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,492
has weakened because
of a lack of talent.

253
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,528
As of late they've
been unable to produce

254
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,297
a single jonin-class shinobi.

255
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,966
-So, she comes from
the Kurama clan.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,134
-Correct.

257
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,603
She is the only daughter
of the head of the family.

258
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,006
But unfortunately
she has health issues

259
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,675
which have kept her from
enrolling in the academy.

260
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,544
-You want me to
act as her master

261
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,679
and train her in
the art of genjutsu?

262
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,947
-No.

263
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,450
Yakumo has already begun
to master genjutsu,

264
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,452
and her potential is incredible.

265
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,721
Her family is aware
of this potential

266
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,990
and they've placed onto her
all of their dreams of a return

267
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,258
to power.

268
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,259
-What is it?

269
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,695
She couldn't deal with that?

270
00:14:55,695 --> 00:15:00,066
-I don't want this to
go beyond this room.

271
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,568
-Of course.

272
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,705
-Yakumo's parents, Murakamo
and Uroko, have passed away.

273
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:14,714
-Easy.

274
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,483
Don't push yourself so hard.

275
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,350
-It's all right.

276
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,051
I'm fine.

277
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,652
Really.

278
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,488
I'm just out of breath.

279
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,157
No need to worry.

280
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,425
-Just relax for a minute.

281
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,026
Let's talk.

282
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,396
You don't have to become
a shinobi, you know.

283
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,964
-Huh?

284
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,565
-You're an intelligent
young woman,

285
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,101
and you need to know that
there are other ways to live.

286
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:35,568
-No!

287
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,403
I don't care.

288
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,604
I want to be a ninja.

289
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,172
I heard about a
student in the academy

290
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,675
named Rock Lee who can't
use ninjutsu or genjutsu.

291
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,179
So he's working to become a
ninja using only taijutsu.

292
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,016
I may not have much physical
strength, but if he can do it

293
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,420
I don't see why I
can't do it, too.

294
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,255
I could use the power
I have and become

295
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,690
and ninja like you, Kurenai.

296
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,691
-I wish I could help you.

297
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,261
But I'm not a teacher like Guy.

298
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,663
I'm sorry, but training
you is out of the question.

299
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,337
-Nice work!

300
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,273
We'll call it quits for today.

301
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,407
-Thank you, Guy-sensei.

302
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,675
-All right.

303
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,178
Now go clean yourself
up and get some rest.

304
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,045
-Yes, sir.

305
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,147
Right away!

306
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,582
[laughter]

307
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,022
-Lee keeps getting better
and better, doesn't he?

308
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,256
-Is it true?

309
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,460
You're leaving your students
and quitting squad eight?

310
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,594
-I have no choice.

311
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,229
Those assigned to
me have not been

312
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,164
reaching their full potential.

313
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,732
-Come on, that's not true.

314
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,235
Although I admit they're
no match for the members

315
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,138
of my squad, the growth that
they're getting in your group

316
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,106
is still quite impressive.

317
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,410
-If so, it's not because
of what I've done.

318
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,214
It's the results of
their own hard work.

319
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,682
-Listen to yourself.

320
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,018
In the end, what can any
of us really do for them?

321
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,424
You commented on how
Lee was progressing,

322
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:08,561
but the credit for all
that progress goes to him.

323
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,697
The only thing I've
done is believe in him,

324
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,166
tell him that
anything's possible.

325
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,704
We believe in our students,
no matter what the cost.

326
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,640
I trust him with my life, and
that gives him the strength

327
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,408
to make the right decisions.

328
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,443
Couldn't be easier.

329
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,677
It's a piece of cake.

330
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,183
-You make everything
sound so simple.

331
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,284
I wish I was like you.

332
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,152
I couldn't even do that much.

333
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,958
-Hey, Kurenai.

334
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,960
GUY (VOICEOVER): Just
believe in yourself.

335
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,505
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Kurenai and
that girl from this morning.

336
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,675
I wonder how they're connected.

337
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,111
It's definitely
worth checking out.

338
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,058
-That's the villa
on Satomi Hill.

339
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,941
-Sounds like the eastern trap.

340
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,275
-An intruder.

341
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,710
-Someone tripped an alarm?

342
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:31,408
-Yes.

343
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,951
-Kurenai.

344
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,553
-Your security
detail is excellent.

345
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,522
I've come to visit Yakumo.

346
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,024
-Isn't it a little late.

347
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,460
-Yakumo's in her room,
but she's resting.

348
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,996
-I'll just need a few
minutes alone with her.

349
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,265
Unfortunately it can't
wait until morning.

350
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,434
-Ma'am.

351
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,269
-Don't be too long.

352
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,137
-I'll be out in 10 minutes.

353
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,005
-See that you do.

354
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,557
-All these paintings
are so morbid.

355
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,074
-You've got to help me, sensei.

356
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:26,993
[scream]

357
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:27,457
-What?

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,600
-Ah!

359
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,935
My heart, my heart!

360
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,607
What the-- I can't
believe I'm still alive.

361
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,644
-Hey, what are you doing here?

362
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,380
Using a transformation
jutsu, huh?

363
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,283
-Would somebody like to tell
me what just happened in there?

364
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,417
-Just shut up.

365
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,652
-If you know what's
good for you,

366
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,954
you'll forget about
what you just saw.

367
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,160
-Hey.

368
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,563
You're Yakumo, aren't you?

369
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,164
I came out here
because I want to ask

370
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,100
you some questions
about Kurenai-sensei.

371
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:13,539
Darn it.

372
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,058
[theme song]

373
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,316
NARUTO: Why am I sleeping
in a place like this?

374
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,617
SAKURA: That's what
happens when you

375
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,086
break into a
high-security safe house.

376
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,287
NARUTO: Oh, right.

377
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:09,622
SAKURA: You should be
grateful you're still alive.

378
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,390
The Anbu black ops
are on this case.

379
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:12,992
NARUTO: The Anbu?

380
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:13,626
That's right!

381
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:14,961
I don't have time for this.

382
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,062
SAKURA: Naruto,
where are you going?

383
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:16,629
NARUTO:Sorry, Sakura.

384
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,097
I have to find Kurenai.

385
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,665
I've got a feeling
she's the only who

386
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,567
knows what's going
on with Yakumo.

387
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,435
SAKURA: What?

388
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:23,636
Hey, Naruto, wait!

389
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:27,306
NARUTO: Next time--
Yakumo's Sealed Power!
