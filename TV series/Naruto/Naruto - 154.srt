00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,029
-Blew them to bits.

3
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:17,662
Blew them to bits
and now they're gone.

4
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,162
And I'm not sad in the least.

5
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,462
I can't hold a funeral
feeling like this.

6
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,196
RANMARU: The four of
them are still alive.

7
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,529
-Impossible.

8
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,562
Not after my Lightning
Fang hit them.

9
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,929
Sorry.

10
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:40,962
If you say they're alive, there
can't be any doubt about it.

11
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,462
RANMARU: One of
them is troublesome.

12
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:49,996
NEJI (VOICEOVER):
The enemy was close,

13
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:54,229
but I couldn't see anything.

14
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:55,862
It's strange.

15
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:58,329
I know this is the
Hidden Mist Jutsu,

16
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:02,829
but my Byakugan should
be able to penetrate it.

17
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:04,996
-Byakugan.

18
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:08,329
There's no question this time.

19
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:11,896
I can see them, a pair, 52
degrees to the southwest.

20
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,362
12 degrees southeast,
another three.

21
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:24,296
Eight degrees to
the southeast, one.

22
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,129
And 24 degrees to
the northwest, 11.

Why?

Bushy Brow?

33
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,362
-The-- the enemy
has disappeared.

34
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,762
NEJI (VOICEOVER): It can't be.

00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,062

RANMARU: One is
halfway up the cliff.

37
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,096
Another's at the base.

38
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,196
There's one to the right,
and one to the left.

but I'll take care of them

without leaving
any trace at least.

41

We're strong, you and I. No,
it's really you, Ranmaru.

46
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,962
You're the strong one,
and when I'm with you,

47
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,262
your strength is mine.

48
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,829
RANMARU: Wait, they
aren't dead yet.

49
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,696
They're just unconscious.

50
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,262
-Stubborn lot, aren't they?

51
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:37,162
All right then, if
grilling them won't work,

52
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,196
I'll just dice them up.

Ranmaru, are you all right?

Hang in there, Ranmaru.

Raiga, this one is
still unconscious.

-What did you say?

63
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:15,496
Impressive.

64
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,262
RANMARU: He's fighting
solely by muscle memory.

65
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,629
RAIGA: Not a bad face.

66
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,929
It's burning into my heart.

67
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,829
Maybe I'll give him
a funeral after all.

68
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:28,262
It will bring tears to
my eyes, I'm sure of it.

69
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,229
RANMARU: On your right.

00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,629
-What's with this guy?

71
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:36,129
RANMARU: It's hard to read his
movements, but for your sake,

72
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,829
I'll do my best.

RANMARU: Left, right,
head on, jump now.

00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:50,529
-You will die.

76

What?

77
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,396
RANMARU: How can he
posses such skill?

-Bushy Brow's in trouble.

I don't get it.

that I was in battle.

-You filthy little brat.

-Hey, I've got something
I want to ask you.

99
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,996
Word is you're one of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen from the Hidden

Mist.

101
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,096
-So what if I was?

102
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,429
-You know Zabuza, right?

103
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,062
And a big guy by
the name of Kisame?

104
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,896
-Look, I have nothing but
loathing for those two.

105
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,462
You'll have to forgive me if
I don't feel like reminiscing.

106
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:47,096
And I'm not too hot on you!

-Well then, I'll just have to
beat the answers out of you!

00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:55,596
-A clone?

-Look yonder.

That's a nasty bit of lightning.

124
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:01,579
It was flashing
just as ominously

125
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:05,012
the day Karashi left to find
his fortune in the village.

Oh, gracious me.

-Sorry, buddy.

It's going to take
more than that.

-I'm not even going to
remember that smile.

Now die.

Where are you?

137
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:46,112

think is in this bag?

Could it be?

141
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,745
So this dust, it was hiding
the chakra network then?

142
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,879
And it's creating
chakra networks as well.

143
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:33,112
NEJI: Naruto, use the
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

144
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,979
-But my clones were
useless before.

NEJI: Don't worry.

146
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,512
His eyes are over
here at the moment.

You just get lucky before?

00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,279
-Laugh it up, kid.

154
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:05,012
I'll just take all of you out.

Better finish this.

-I have to help.

168
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,479
-Ha, did you see that?

169
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,312
NARUTO: Yeah, I saw it.

170
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:01,979
-Huh?

171
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,179
-Hope you're ready, pal!

172
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:04,779
RANMARU: Stop!

173
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,679
-Too late now!

174
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:13,645
[screaming]

175
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:23,379
-Yikes, I guess that takes
care of that then, huh?

176
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:26,879
So, Raiga's eyes are
inside that thing?

177
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,279
Hm.

178
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,379
They must be some
pretty big eyeballs.

179
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:31,479
-Huh?

180
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,779
-You idiot, it's a person.

181
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,579
-Huh?

182
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,879
-So wait a moment, when I
was sleepwalking before then,

183
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,379
was it you I fought?

184
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:46,745
-No, it wasn't.

185
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,212
It was Raiga and I together.

186
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,879
-Together?

187
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,745
-Always, ever since he found me.

188
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,079
[screaming]

189
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,812
[smashing on door]

190
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:30,012
-No use feigning sleep.

191
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:34,279
The hour of your
death has arrived.

192
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,179
Don't move.

193
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:40,479
The Hidden Mist was infiltrated
by spies from this village.

194
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,845
We've come to smoke
them out and kill them.

195
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,179
Problem is we're not having
any luck finding our targets,

196
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:51,112
so I've just been
killing people at random.

197
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,079
[moan]

198
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,045
-What's that?

199
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,579
Speak up.

200
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,945
[cough]

201
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:03,912
-It's all right if you are
the one taking my life.

202
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,312
-Huh?

203
00:15:05,345 --> 00:15:06,779
Me?

204
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,045
What do you mean?

205
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:12,062
-I saw you, always crying.

206
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,162
-What?

207
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,528
Me, cry?

208
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:18,795
Deep within your
heart, as you searched

209
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,528
for meaning in your life.

210
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,995
[gasp]

211
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:27,128
RANMARU: You see, I've
been watching you.

212
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:28,462
-What are you?

213
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,295
How could you--

214
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,795
RANMARU: I'm the same as you.

215
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:36,362
Living is painful.

216
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,595
I long to understand
the meaning of my life.

217
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,762
My illness forces me indoors.

218
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:46,295
Shunned by everyone, all I can
do is peer out at the world

219
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,095
from under this blanket.

220
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:52,695
But if in my death, you're
able to glean some meaning

221
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:58,928
behind this thing we
call living, well, then

222
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:00,428
who am I to stop you?

223
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:07,362
Go ahead.

224
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:09,762
RAIGA: You're alone then?

225
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:13,128
-Mm.

226
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,928
-Come.

227
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:23,495
From here on out, you
and I shall be as one.

228
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,895
RANMARU (VOICEOVER):
That was the day

229
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,362
I became Raiga's eyes and ears.

230
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,795
And Raiga became
my hands and feet.

231
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:49,528
The outside world
that we dashed into

232
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,695
was filled with
things that I saw

233
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:54,795
and heard for the
first time in my life.

234
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:56,628
It was so much fun.

235
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:08,995
Wherever and whenever I was with
Raiga, nothing else mattered.

236
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,995
We were never apart.

237
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:41,662
We were trying to find
the meaning in our lives

238
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,462
by living for each other.

239
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,528
We were convinced we
had found the answer.

240
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:02,562
That's why if Raiga is gone,
I have no reason to live.

241
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,995
Without him, I have no
purpose in this world,

242
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:07,195
no cause to exist.

243
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:14,495
-Is there someone
who's precious to you?

244
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,962
There is only one person
who matters to me.

245
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:20,428
And I live to protect
and serve him.

246
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:23,862
That is my purpose.

247
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:28,295
To show mercy to those who
oppose the one you serve,

248
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:32,095
to allow his enemies to live
when you go could strike them

249
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:35,795
down-- this is not compassion.

250
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:39,095
It is a betrayal of your
life's very purpose.

251
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,362
For what reason
do you exist then?

252
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,962
You're of use to no one.

253
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,528
Your life has no meaning.

254
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,962
It is mere existence.

255
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:53,095
Day after day of pain and
struggle signifying nothing.

256
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:53,862
-Yeah?

257
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,295
Well, speak for yourself.

258
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:57,228
-Are you really that
blind, little one?

259
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,828
I am speaking of myself.

260
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:04,295
This day has shown that I am
no longer of any use to Zabuza.

261
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:07,228
-There's no need for me
to be here any longer.

262
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,228
-Look, don't be ridiculous.

263
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:14,728
You can't talk like that.

264
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,195
-Naruto, kill me.

265
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,195
I'm begging you.

266
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,662
Just put and end to it.

267
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:21,162
-Huh?

268
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,695
-What are you waiting for?

269
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,228
Go on.

270
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,262
Do it.

271
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,062
Quickly.

272
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:30,995
-Go on.

273
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:33,195
Why do you hesitate?

274
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:34,962
My arms and legs are crippled.

275
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,995
I'm powerless to resist you.

276
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:43,795
You have a mission to
carry out, don't you?

277
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,928
Well, hurry up and finish it.

278
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:54,128
-The mission entrusted to us
was to drive the Kurosuke family

279
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:55,328
out of here.

280
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,095
And with Raiga out of
the way now, he no longer

281
00:19:58,128 --> 00:19:59,695
poses a threat to the village.

282
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:00,195
-Mm.

283
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:06,362
-The question at hand is what
to do about the Kurosuke family

284
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,928
now that they have
no leadership.

285
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,995
Take the head off
of a beast, and it's

286
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,662
hard to predict what it will do.

287
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:20,762
Once that's done, the
mission will be completed.

288
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:27,062
-Hm, but, uh, what are we
supposed to do about him?

289
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,395
-Do you really think he is
dangerous enough to tie up?

290
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,495
-No, I don't believe so.

291
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:45,262
-But dangerous to
myself though, maybe.

292
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:48,728
-Once our mission is over,
we'll come back for you, OK?

293
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,728
-A chakra sealing tag as well?

294
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,562
-Look, we don't
have a choice, Lee.

295
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:02,562
He's still our enemy, isn't he?

296
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,095
-We have to assume that he
still possesses other jutsu just

297
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:07,869
to be safe.

[theme music]

299
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,889
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Rokusuke and the others

300
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,123
have their village back.

301
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:05,589
Looks like the
mission's complete.

NEJI (VOICEOVER):
Tell that to Lee.

303

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Oh yeah, that's right.

304
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:10,423
Lee said he was going to
beat some sense into Karashi,

305
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,656
didn't he?

wonder if it'll be that easy.

LEE (VOICEOVER): This
could be troublesome.

308
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:15,589
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What?

309
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,723
I don't want to
hear that from you.

310
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,523
LEE (VOICEOVER): No, I
did not mean Karashi.

311
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,789
I was speaking of this weather.

312

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Next time--
The Dark Creeping Clouds.

313
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:24,923
NEJI (VOICEOVER): I see.

314
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:27,523
A storm is coming.
