TSUNADE: There has been a
coup in the Land of Greens?

3
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,193
-Yes, it's been confirmed.

4
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,028
The lord of the land
has been overthrown

5
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,597
with the help of some
of his very own people.

6
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,199
-And Naruto's squad?

7
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,267
-Their progress from
their last known position

8
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,637
would bring them to
right about here.

9
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,406
TSUNADE: So they must have
already crossed the border.

10
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,975
-Well, the area's been
declared a demilitarized zone

11
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,276
by the neighboring lands.

12
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,179
And considering the nonmilitary
nature of Naruto's mission,

13
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,182
I'm sure he and the
others are safe.

14
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,350
-Hm, I'm not.

15
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,284
-But why?

16
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,053
What do you mean?

17
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,356
-These separate events
happening at the same time,

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,026
you really think
it's a coincidence?

19
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,460
-Are you saying the
mission to escort

20
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,163
the merchants is tied up
with the coup somehow?

21
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,098
-It seems more than likely.

22
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,601
In any case, we can't worry
about Naruto and the others

23
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,602
now.

24
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,170
The Land of Greens
must be recaptured

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,706
and the usurpers expelled
as soon as possible.

26
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,042
The longer things are left
like this, the more likely

27
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,710
a full-scaled war
will break out.

28
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,744
-That's true.

29

-Shizune, summon
every available ninja

30
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,016
and get them ready to move
on the Land of Greens.

31
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,051
-Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,132
-OK.

33
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,634
Now, you've made me mad!

You won't get up again.

At least, you have some spirit.

He can't hear you.

My magnetic sand interferes
with the electric impulses

in his brain.

Huh, hear you?

52
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,181
Right now, he can't
even think straight.

down, literally!

more than you can handle.

Huh?

-No way.

That's the Byakugan
of the Leaf Village.

-Not even close.

I'm afraid it will
take a lot more

than that level of Taijutsu!

Now, why don't we end this?

101
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,050
Just tell me where
you've hidden the girl.

102
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,319
Tell me and I may let you live.

103
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,420
The boy, too.

104
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,124
But you better hurry,
he hasn't got long.

105
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,992
-Uh.

106
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,728
-Run, Hinata, while you can.

107
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,363
-Tell me, where is she?

108
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,232
-No.

109
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,535
-Do you actually believe
you can defeat me?

110
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,272
Or is it just that you don't
care about saving the boy?

111
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,541
HINATA (VOICEOVER): If I tell
him what he wants to know,

112
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,444
Naruto will never forgive me.

113
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,979
-Huh!

114
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,181
And if that's that way you want
it, we'll do it the hard way!

115
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,588
I've just magnetized that
rock wall behind you.

116
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,092
I can turn any of these
rocks into a powerful magnet,

117
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,460
so you've nowhere to run.

118
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,072
Hm?

119

JIGA (VOICEOVER): Very clever.

Don't worry, Naruto.

127
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,403
I'll come back for you.

128
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,371
I promise.

129
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,275
He's too powerful.

130
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,244
I can never defeat him.

131
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,580
Can I even survive against him?

132
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,061
He's caught up with me already?

133
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,062
What do I do?

134
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,002
Uh, what's this?

135
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,372
Some kind of iron sand?

136
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,573
Oh!

137
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,309
That's what he was doing--
knocking off the iron sand

138
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,311
that his magnetized
body had attracted.

139
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,718
That's why he didn't
attack me right away.

140
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,687
He had to shake off the
magnetic sand from his body.

141
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,690
If he doesn't, he'll
attract the very weapons

142
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,292
he uses against us.

143
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,695
That explains his pattern of
attack-- alternating Ninja Art

144
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,298
Magnet with the
Iron Sand Gejutsu.

145
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,700
It's as if he has to
give himself enough time

146
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,670
to turn his magnetized
body on and off.

147
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,675
Perhaps there is a way
to defeat him after all.

148
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,643
-Enough of this!

149
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,178
Play time's over!

150
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,549
Give up.

151
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,117
Can't you see it's pointless?

152
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,053
-Not while there's still
breath left in my body!

153
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,256
Giving up is not
part of my ninja way!

154
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,524
-It's your funeral!

155
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,093
-Naruto is my friend.

156
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,296
I will never forgive you
for what you did to him!

157
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,565
-You'll join your friend
in the spirit world

158
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,001
after you've told me
where the girl is!

159
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:02,435
Eeyah!

160
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,043
Now, don't be shy.

161
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,312
Come a little closer!

162
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,248
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Now, Hinata,
you only have one chance.

163
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,585
Make it count!

164
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,185
-Hai!

165
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,758
-Uh!

166
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,428
-Heh, did you think
that same attack

167
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,063
would work at me
better this time?

168
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,435
-Yes, I did.

169
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,704
-Huh?

170
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,304
Hrngh.

171
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,709
-No!

172
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,146
-[gasping]

173
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,984
The only one who's going to
the spirit world are you and I!

174
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:51,317
-Ugh!

175
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,352
Ugh!

176
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:52,752
Aargh!

177
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:05,265
What do you think you're doing?

178
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,267
Get off!

179
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,635
-Argh!

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,638
Ugh!

181
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,574
-Little fool, you annoy me.

182
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,309
I've changed my mind.

183
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,311
I'm going to finish you off now.

184
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:18,711
Huh?

185
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,018
Huh?

186
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,019
What?

187
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,655
What the devil's going on?

188
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,392
-Just now, I hit one
of your chakra points,

189
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:37,230
disrupting the flow of
chakra through your body.

190
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,500
And now, your body
is a powerful magnet

191
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,136
that you can't switch off.

192
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,340
-That's why you led me to
this canyon full of iron sand.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,174
Urgh!

194
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,409
Make it stop.

195
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,745
Urrgh, urgh.

196
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,348
-I did it.

197
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:59,319
Naruto, I-- um, mm.

198
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,372
-I can't move at all.

199
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,707
SPEAKER: Human Boulder!

200
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,178
Yaah!

201
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,617
Naruto.

202
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,053
-[gasping]

203
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,456
Choji.

204
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,258
Uhh.

205
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,560
-You sure you're
all right, Naruto?

206
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,096
-Yeah, I'm sorry, Yurinojo.

207
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:43,630
-For what?

208
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,698
What happened?

209
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,135
I was attacked by that second
ninja, and I let him beat me.

210
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,204
-What about Hinata
and the princess?

211
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,572
-Hinata!

212
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,673
I got to get going!

213
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,609
-Oh, Naruto, you're in
no shape to go anywhere.

214
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,111
-She's in danger!

215
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:58,511
-Hold on.

216
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,112
Wait!

217
00:12:59,145 --> 00:12:59,512
-Naruto!

218
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,028
-Hinata!

219
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:19,999
Aaah!

220
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,510
-Hinata, are you OK?

221
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,045
-Hinata?

222
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,713
Hinata?

223
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,982
-Naruto, you're here.

224
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,251
And Choji?

225
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:38,651
Yurinojo?

226
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,555
You did this.

227
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,491
You did this all just for me?

228
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,293
-Sure, what did you expect?

229
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,662
What do you think
friends are for?

230
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,764
-Uh, yeah.

231
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,468
-Say, where did Mr.
Magnet Man get off to?

232
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,203
-He won't bother us anymore.

233
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,238
He's buried under the sand.

234
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,206
-He's what?

235
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,207
You mean, you did it?

236
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,209
You really beat him?

237
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,577
-Yeah.

238
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,480
Well, I mean, I
did what I could.

239
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,682
-Man, Hinata, you're amazing!

240
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,385
You saw how well I handled him.

241
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,622
-Uh, you don't know what that
means coming from you, Naruto.

242
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,326
Uh, look, Naruto, it's yours.

243
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,394
-My headband?

244
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,530
But where did you-- ah.

245
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,200
-Our mission is far
from being over.

246
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,469
There is still Princess Haruna.

247
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,738
You must find her
and protect her.

248
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:32,672
-Don't worry.

249
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,344
I'm going to take care of it.

250
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,146
And I swear to you
by this headband,

251
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,349
I'll make sure nothing
happens to her.

252
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,387
Besides, I can't let you go
around making me look bad.

253
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,721
[chuckles]

254
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,256
-Of course not.

255
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,624
-You guys, stay.

256
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,025
Look after Hinata.

257
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,027
Can you do that?

258
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:55,695
-Right.

259
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,163
-We'll take care of her, Naruto.

260
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,476
-Well, who would have thought?

261
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,246
Ruiga and Jiga have
both been defeated.

262
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,650
Ha, it saves me the trouble.

263
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:28,628
But still, there's not a person
alive who can defeat my jutsu.

264
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,763
I sense today is going
to be a sunny day.

265
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,504
-Haruna, are you here?

266
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,072
Huh?

267
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:49,081
Is that-- it's her!

268
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:49,749
Haruna!

269
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,617
Haruna!

270
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,585
-[groans]

271
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,355
-Are you OK?

272
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,228
-Hm.

273
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,629
-[sighs]

274
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,097
You had me worried for a second.

275
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,432
-Uhh.

276
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,400
-Aaah!

277
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,734
What are you doing?

278
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,603
It's me!

279
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,204
-What?

280
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,038
Naruto?

281
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,739
-I came to help you.

282
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,108
What was that all about?

283
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,478
-I'm sorry.

284
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,214
-What do you mean running
off all by yourself anyway?

285
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,982
-I'm all alone now.

286
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,418
I can't depend on anyone.

287
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,488
The rest of you are only
here to assure my survival,

288
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,490
nothing else.

289
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,359
As long as I survive, there's
a chance the Land of Greens

290
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,228
can be restored.

291
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,431
That's all that really
matters in the end, isn't it?

292
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,399
I am the rightful heir.

293
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,437
I must reclaim the power
that is rightly mine.

294
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,739
Once I'm lord of
the Land of Greens,

295
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:50,476
the people will flock to serve
me, their faith restored.

296
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,013
The land will be again
what it once was.

297
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,114
-You think?

298
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,216
I'm not so sure about that.

299
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,751
-Are you saying
the Land of Greens

300
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,486
can never be great again?

301
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,354
-No!

302
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,055
No, that's not what I meant.

303
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,727
But I was thinking if
I lived in your land,

304
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:17,737
was one of your people, if I was
a ninja, like Yurinojo-- what

305
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,572
I'm trying to say
is I don't think

306
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,075
I'd be able to serve
a lord like you.

307
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,277
-How dare you?

308
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,511
How dare you say that?

309
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,280
What can you possibly
know about it?

310
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,215
You know nothing of
what I've gone through,

311
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,552
living my life as a hostage
ever since I was a child.

312
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,555
Surrounded by strangers,
watched 24 hours a day,

313
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,657
never getting to do what I want!

314
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,458
You have no idea
of the loneliness.

315
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,196
I couldn't take it.

316
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,066
Eventually, I became
very, very ill.

317
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,337
I almost died before my parents
finally let me come home.

318
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,605
Say it.

319
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,508
If you think something's wrong
with that, say it, Naruto.

320
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,410
Could it be wrong
when it was all

321
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,479
for the sake of
the Land of Greens?

322
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,348
Is it wrong for a
mother and father

323
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,518
to send their child away to live
among strangers as a hostage?

324
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,653
Is it, Naruto?

325
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,387
Answer me!

326
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,099
I depend on no one.

327
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,235
I will do this on my own.

328
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,203
-Hold on.

329
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,607
I'm coming with you.

330
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,076
Like it or not, I made
a promise to Hinata.

331
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,410
And I'm going to protect you.

332
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,348
-To Hinata?

333
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,252
-She got pretty badly
injured fighting

334
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,188
that second ninja
who was after you.

335
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,056
-She what?

336
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,158
But I was sure that
you and the rest

337
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,395
have decided that protecting
me wasn't part of your mission.

338
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,564
If that's true, why
are you doing this?

339
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,499
-It's just the way we are.

340
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,103
We don't like it when see
somebody getting a raw deal,

341
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,306
even if that somebody
is maybe not, well,

342
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,577
the nicest person in the world.

343
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,145
But that's not important.

344
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,480
There's a narrow
canyon up ahead.

345
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,315
And we've got to get through it.

346
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,983
The village is on
the other side.

347
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,419
And hopefully, they
won't follow us there.

348
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,187
Come on, let's go!

349
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:15,588
-Uhh.

350
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,467
-Be careful where you step.

351
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,170
This deer trail hasn't
been used for ages.

352
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,039
They'll never think of
looking for us here.

353
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,206
[crackling]

354
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,607
-Huh?

355
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,079
Huh?

356
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,188
-Sorry to disappoint you.

357
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,023
All that trouble for nothing.

358
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:55,327
There's nowhere on earth
you can hide from me.

359
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,696
-Urgh.

360
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,631
Ugh.

361
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,231
-Huh?

362
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,633
Choji!

363
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,602
-Needless to say,
resistance is futile.

364
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,604
You may all consider
yourselves my hostages.

365
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,210
Take the three of them
back to the castle at once.

366
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,379
-My lord.

367
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,748
-I wouldn't want any of
you getting hurt now.

368
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm about to use
some powerful jutsu.

369
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,753
Hm.

370
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,689
-[panting]

371
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,171
There it is, Haruna.

372
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,172
We're almost there.

373
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,046
Well, what are we
waiting for, then?

374
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,414
Let's go!

375
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,982
-Hm.

376
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:50,716
Ugh!

377
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,383
-Huh?

378
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,352
What is it?

379
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,653
-I'm OK.

380
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,155
[whistling]

381
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,223
-Uh-oh!

382
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:57,623
Ngh!

383
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,561
What was that?

384
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,496
MAN: Bravo!

385
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,730
-Huh?

386
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,000
MAN: I must commend you for
anticipating that attack.

387
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:08,968
-Who's that?

388
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,735
Where are you?

389
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,604
-[laughs]

390
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,639
I'm right up here.

391
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:19,111
You were so close, but you'll
never reach that village now.

392
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm afraid your
journey ends here.

393
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,191
[music playing]

394
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:03,716
-Oh, man, this guy's really
getting on my nerves!

395
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,252
Going on and on about
his all-powerful jutsu,

396
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,721
bragging about how
invincible he is!

397
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,422
Of course, he does have a point.

398
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:13,325
I haven't found any way to
get past his offenses yet.

399
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,195
And Haruna's injured,
so she's not much help.

400
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,529
In fact, we're cornered.

401
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,533
Come to think of it, maybe he's
got a reason to brag after all!

402
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,436
Next time, "Forecast Death!

403
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,973
Cloudy with a Chance of Sun."

404
