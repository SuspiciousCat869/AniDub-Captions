Forget what your job is?

00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:39,809
Do I have to do it for you?

15
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:44,814
Out of the way.

-No, Fuki.

00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,518
Thanks.

19
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,953
You won't be needing it.

spare my daughter.

up, father. [crying]

You're mine.

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Legendary
menma pickled bamboo shoots?

44
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,973
CHEF: Oh, it's delicious.

45
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:20,442
The problem is finding the
right kind of bamboo shoot

46
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,510
to make it.

47
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,112
It's rare, and grows
high up on the side

48
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,714
of steep cliffs,
very hard to find.

49
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,150
-That's only because I haven't
been looking for it yet.

50
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:31,020
I've got to try this menma
stuff on top of your ramen.

51
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,056
I'll find that bamboo
no matter where it is.

52
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:37,626
[gasping] OK, you stupid bamboo.

53
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,562
I gotcha.

54
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,431
Ahhh.

55
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:45,834
[sighs] That was close.

56
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,571
Hm?

57
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:49,038
It's a person.

58
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,577
Is he alive?

59
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:04,620
Ahh-- [screams]

60
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,126
Ahh-- [screams]

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,964
-All this thunder, and
not a drop of rain.

62
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:15,731
It's creepy.

64
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:22,805
-Hey, stop yelling.

65
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:25,941
Keep it down, this
is a hospital zone.

66
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,810
-You made me yell, you moron.

67
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,411
-Whoa, look at you.

68
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,880
The medical corps finally
gave you a uniform, huh?

69
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,015
-You like it?

70
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:35,417
Yeah, I've been waiting
forever to get one.

71
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,819
-Looks good.

72
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,855
Anyway, it's a lucky break that
I found you on duty, Sakura.

73
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:41,991
I've got someone here you
need to take a look at.

74
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,525
-What do you mean?

75
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,493
Who?

76
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,695
-That fella right over there.

77
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:48,397
-What happened to him?

78
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,832
Looks like hypothermia.

79
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:50,699
-Hypo-- what?

80
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,034
You mean you know this guy?

81
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,969
That's a funny name.

82
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,571
-It's not his name, you idiot.

83
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,607
It's what happens when your body
temperature, oh, why bother.

84
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,176
Yeah, hypothermia, he's
a guy I used to know.

85
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,111
-Really?

86
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,146
Well, that'll make
things easier.

87
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,014
-Whoa, whoa.

88
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,482
What do you think you're doing?

89
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,550
This is a leaf village hospital,
we can't admit outsiders.

90
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:10,052
-We can't just leave
him on the ground.

91
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,988
And I've got an important
mission, to take care of him.

92
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:15,391
-Wait, you can't just-- Naruto!

93
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,559
You get back here.

94
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,895
-Mmm.

95
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,930
Yeah, that's the rare
bamboo, all right.

96
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,432
Well done.

97
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:26,835
--[giggles] OK, slap it on a
bowl of ramen, and serve it up.

98
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,470
-I hate to break it
to you, but it'll

99
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,639
take three or four weeks
to turn these things

100
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,474
into menma pickled
bamboo shoots.

101
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:33,842
[cries aloud]

102
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,111
-They get boiled,
then fermented slowly.

103
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,913
Three or four weeks, at least.

104
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:40,916
-So even a little taste
now, is out of the question?

105
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,086
-Sometimes, the best things
in life require patience.

106
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,854
-So, this is your
important mission, huh?

107
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:47,856
-Uh, howdy-oh there, Sakura.

108
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,824
Ugh--

109
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,593
-I ought to put
you in a hospital.

110
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,829
You really thought you could
just dump that guy on me,

111
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,964
and then come here
and stuff your face?

112
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,933
-Well, yeah kind of.

113
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,111
-Back to the past, Jutsu.

114
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:13,682
-What's going on?

115
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,017
What's he doing to him?

116
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,518
-Shhh.

117
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,887
SAKURA: He's probing
his subconscious memory.

118
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,855
-Oh.

119
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:22,157
That reverse
hypnosis thing, huh?

120
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:22,952
-Right.

121
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:27,596
-Can you remember anything now?

122
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,534
I see.

123
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,137
-It seems he's completely
lost his memory.

124
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,439
-He lost his memory?

125
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,108
-Well, that's enough for today.

126
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:42,444
We'll continue tomorrow.

127
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:45,481
-Total amnesia, his
name, his village.

128
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,416
He can't remember a thing.

129
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,119
If he won't respond to that
Jutsu, it's a serious case.

130
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:51,787
-You didn't find
anything on him,

131
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,022
or in his clothes that
might tell us who he is?

132
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,957
-M-mm.

133
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,792
All he had on him
was that thing.

134
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:00,896
-Hmm.

135
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,731
What is it, anyway?

136
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:03,799
-An ocarina.

137
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:05,567
It's a kind of flute.

138
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,869
-Ocarena?

139
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,570
-A broken one.

140
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,939
-You could fix it pretty easily.

141
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,708
-It might be just
a temporary state

142
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,843
of shock causing the amnesia.

143
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:17,012
Anyway, I need you to
sign this release form.

144
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:17,613
-Huh?

145
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:18,414
What for?

146
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,982
-For liability.

147
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:23,419
Like I said, this is a
leaf village hospital.

148
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,554
We don't treat outsiders, ever.

149
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:26,922
That's why it's
your responsibility

150
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,158
if anything happens
because of this guy.

151
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:29,892
-Heh?

152
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,093
-You got a problem?

153
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,561
-Uh, no.

154
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,829
I'm OK.

155
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:37,399
Just hoping I don't live to
regret doing a good deed.

156
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,899
-Uh.

157
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,101
[gasping] What was that?

158
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,169
It's a fire.

159
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,705
That's near the hospital.

160
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:18,674
-It's all right.

161
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,609
Everybody, just stay
calm, and keep moving.

162
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:21,977
Everything will be fine.

163
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:36,158
[gasps]

00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:50,506
[screaming]

165
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,442
-Ah-- ahh.

166
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:56,111
Forgive me, forgive me.

167
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,680
Forgive me.

168
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,016
-Hey, is anyone still here?

169
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:03,552
Hello, is anyone up here?

170
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:04,553
Answer me.

171
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,094
-Sakura, did you
get everyone out?

172
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,062
-I just finished checking again.

173
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:14,997
-Hey.

174
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,565
Sakura.

175
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:17,432
-Naruto?

176
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:18,433
-Is everyone OK?

177
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,801
-Yeah, I think so.

178
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,136
-Wait, where is he?

179
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,404
-Huh?

180
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:26,575
Now that you mention
it, I don't see him.

181
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:27,976
-My baby!

182
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,444
He didn't make it out.

183
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,747
Do something, my baby's
still inside there.

184
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,849
-It's still inside?

185
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,951
-Too late, the fire's
too big for anyone

186
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:37,519
to get back in there.

187
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,822
-Hurry up, and get that
fire under control.

188
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:45,394
[baby crying]

189
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,047
[music playing]

190
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,418
-I'll go in, no sweat.

191
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,385
-No way.

192
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,119
You'll never make it.

193
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,555
The baby's in the farthest ward.

194
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:17,793
[music playing]

195
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:21,830
-Wait, is that--
is that a flute?

196
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,967
It's getting louder.

197
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,402
Getting close.

198
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,104
There he is.

199
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,072
Shadow cloud jutsu!

200
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,510
-We gotcha.

201
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:36,545
Uhh-ahh.

202
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:39,147
-And look, look who
he's got with him.

203
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:39,748
-Well done.

204
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,416
-My baby.

205
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,452
-Oh my, what a relief.

206
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,820
-That was too close.

207
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:45,821
-Thank you, thank you.

208
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,956
Thank you so much.

209
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,424
-You're welcome.

210
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:52,427
-I can never thank
you enough, never.

211
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:03,704
-A mystery outsider
with amnesia.

212
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:06,307
Well, this is a fine
mess you've put us in.

213
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,109
-It's just one guy.

214
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:10,044
C'mon, you're going to
him stay, aren't you?

215
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,579
-You know we can't.

216
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:14,048
To allow a complete stranger
to come into the village,

217
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:14,916
and live among us?

218
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,150
It's unheard of.

219
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:19,287
-You can't really suspect that
he's a spy or something, not

220
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,855
after what he did
at the hospital.

221
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,223
-That doesn't make
any difference.

222
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,158
When it comes to the
security of the village,

223
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:25,259
we cannot bend the rules.

224
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,762
-I've taken responsibility
for him, haven't I?

225
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:29,630
If he does anything,
I'll handle it.

226
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,666
-Sakura, how's he doing, anyway?

227
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,634
Has he remembered anything yet?

228
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:36,637
-No ma'am, nothing yet.

229
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,139
-I see.

230
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:40,141
-C'mon, say yes,
and I'll promise

231
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:43,744
I'll tell you try some rare
menma pickled bamboo shoots.

232
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:46,180
-Rare, pickled bamboo shoots?

233
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,315
-That's right.

234
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,250
In fact, I was picking
the bamboo for it

235
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:52,119
after my last mission
when I found this guy.

236
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:53,721
Err-

237
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:54,755
-You were doing what?

238
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:55,990
-Ow.

239
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:57,892
-You're supposed to report
back after your missions,

240
00:12:57,925 --> 00:12:58,893
not pick bamboo.

241
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,595
-You can let go now.

242
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,165
-Naruto, are you serious
about taking responsibility

243
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,600
for this stranger?

244
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,236
-Yeah, completely serious.

245
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,337
-Right.

246
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,306
I'll let the boy stay
in the village, for now.

247
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:13,307
-Lady Tsunade!

248
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,209
-We can't just kick
him out after he

249
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,345
saved the life of
one of our children.

250
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:19,046
-Now you're talking.

251
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,681
You won't be sorry, grandma.

252
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,786
My name's Naruto, by the way.

253
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,688
It's nice to meet you.

254
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:30,191
-Oh, I'm, uh--

255
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,659
-Oh, right.

256
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:34,028
We got to call you something
'til you remember your name.

257
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,196
Let's see.

258
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,999
Uh, I know.

259
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:40,201
We're going to call you menma.

260
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:41,736
-Menma?

261
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,972
-Yeah, for the bamboo shoots I
was picking when I found you.

262
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,708
-Menma, huh?

263
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:50,278
All right, it's a good
a name as any, I guess.

264
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,713
-Well, it's nice
to meet you, Menma.

265
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,315
-Nice to meet you too, Naruto.

266
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,784
-Well, there you go.

267
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,186
-Oh, this looks delicious.

268
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,622
-The ramen in this place
is the best in the world.

269
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:05,259
-Thanks for the food.

270
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:05,860
Let's eat.

271
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,631
-Oh, that's good.

272
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:13,868
[chuckles] You haven't
tasted anything yet.

273
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,771
Didn't you notice that there's
something still missing?

274
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,639
-Huh?

275
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:19,907
Oh, yeah.

276
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,610
There's no menma pickled
bamboo shoots on it.

277
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:23,911
-That's right.

278
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,681
And there's not going to be
any until that rare bamboo you

279
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,249
brought me is good, and ready.

280
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:31,018
-OK, but you're not going
to forget about it, are you?

281
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,320
-No, of course not.

282
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:34,221
[laughing] Great, I can't wait.

283
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:35,890
When it's all
ready, you and I are

284
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,091
going to try some menma, Menma.

285
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:38,759
It's a date, OK?

286
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:44,098
Welcome to my pad, come on in.

287
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:45,566
-You sure you don't mind?

288
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,334
-Nah.

289
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,903
From now on, my
home is you're home.

290
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,973
I know it looks a little
messy right now, but--

291
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:56,310
[gasps] A little messy?

292
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:57,712
-It's not that bad.

293
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:59,146
Don't be so picky.

294
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,315
-No, it's fine, really.

295
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,284
-Anyway, I say we
get some sleep.

296
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:05,086
First thing tomorrow,
you and I start

297
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:08,823
working on getting
your memory back.

298
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:15,997
-Mmm. [snoring] (SLEEPTALKING)
No more ramen, I'm stuffed.

299
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,964
OK, one more.

300
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:37,184
[yawning] I slept like a log.

301
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,619
-Good morning, Naruto.

302
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,154
-Uh?

303
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:42,890
Menma.

304
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,625
Whoa.

305
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:46,027
Everything's all cleaned up.

306
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,628
What happened?

307
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:48,295
Was it you?

308
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,598
You did all this by yourself?

309
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:51,632
-Yeah.

310
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:52,900
I couldn't sleep, so
I had time to kill.

311
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,101
-Well, thanks.

312
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,302
I appreciate it.

313
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:59,040
[yawning] Menma, what
the heck are you doing?

314
00:15:59,073 --> 00:15:59,774
-Huh?

315
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,075
What do you mean?

316
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,910
I'm just taking up the
laundry, that's all.

317
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:04,211
-Ah, are you crazy?

318
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,080
Washing someone
else's underwear?

319
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:07,581
Forget about it, leave it alone.

320
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,016
I can do those myself.

321
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:09,617
-OK.

322
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,723
-All righty then.

323
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:19,160
The first thing we gotta do is
try and get your memory back.

324
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:19,760
A-ha.

325
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,629
I got it.

326
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:22,196
Heh, c'mon.

327
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,637
Ever seen sand dumplings?

328
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:30,971
They're from the land of wind.

329
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,240
They're called that because
the outside looks like sand,

330
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,642
but they're really good.

331
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:35,910
-Yeah?

332
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,913
-And these are stone rice
cakes from the land of earth.

333
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:42,550
Really crunchy, they're the
best if you like crunchy.

334
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,617
-M-hm.

335
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:44,985
-And the stuff next to
it is mist mitsumame

336
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,087
from the land of water.

337
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,889
Does any of this look
familiar to you, to all?

338
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:49,757
-No.

339
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,225
None of it.

340
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,626
-Too bad.

341
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,195
I was hoping that something
here would ring a bell,

342
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:56,764
and then we might know where
you were from, at least.

343
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:57,832
-Sorry.

344
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,334
-That's OK, it's not
like it's your fault.

345
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:04,939
-Naruto, thanks, but don't
worry about me, really.

346
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,574
-Why?

347
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:09,176
-My memory will come
back when it comes back.

348
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:11,278
If it comes back.

349
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:14,682
And besides that, you must
work to do, don't you?

350
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:16,183
-Well, yeah I do, actually.

351
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:19,153
I'm supposed to clean the
mountainside images today.

352
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:21,255
-Fine then, I'll
help you with that.

353
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:23,691
-OK.

354
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:24,225
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:25,726
Before we do that--

356
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,660
-Hm?

357
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:29,330
Where are you going?

358
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:30,865
-Excuse me, ma'am.

359
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,567
Could I help carry those
groceries home for you?

360
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,803
-Why, that's very kind of you.

361
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,847
-Thank you very much, young man.

362
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,716
-My pleasure.

363
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:51,285
I can't help noticing,
it looks like you

364
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,155
need some help with your garden.

365
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,757
-I just let the weeds
grow where they will.

366
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,627
Gardening's too hard
on my back, you see?

367
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,595
-I can take care
of them for you.

368
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:04,565
-You will?

369
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:05,132
-Uh, here.

370
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,667
Let me give you a hand.

371
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,904
-Well, thank you both.

372
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:11,272
-Ugh.

373
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,174
That took a lot
longer than I thought.

374
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,341
-Hey, Naruto?

375
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:15,709
-Yeah, what?

376
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,011
-They asked for our help, too.

377
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:18,245
-Really?

378
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,214
-Seems there are a lot of
elderly people living alone

379
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:21,348
in this part of the village.

380
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,083
-I appreciate the help.

381
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:25,019
-You're sure you don't mind?

382
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,587
-Heh?

383
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,588
(AFRAID) No.

384
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:31,825
-What's all this?

385
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,895
-They're all thank you gifts
for Naruto and that boy.

386
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:37,131
They've been coming in
from all over the village.

387
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:39,733
-What in the world have
the two of them been up to?

388
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:46,040
-I've got to say, whoever you
are, you're an unusual guy.

389
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,241
-Am I?

390
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:50,611
-You're so kind, and
helpful, and hard working.

391
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:53,781
In my experience, not
everybody's like that.

392
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:57,284
-I just want to live my life
the right way, that's all.

393
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,853
No, no regrets, you know?

394
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,222
-Why do you say that?

395
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,023
Have you remembered something?

396
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,059
-Oh, uh, no, not really.

397
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:07,094
-Oh, OK.

398
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:07,962
Ah.

399
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:08,762
Great, what is it?

400
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:11,232
Bird poop?

401
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:12,800
It's blood.

402
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:20,641
[gasps] [grunts]
Menma, give me a hand.

403
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,609
-Here.

404
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:24,345
[grunting]

405
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:26,313
-What the heck happened?

406
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:30,251
-There's someone in the village.

407
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:33,754
[grunting] Let's move.

408
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:36,023
Menma, will you stay
and look after him?

409
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:36,790
-Yes, of course.

410
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,631
-Ah.

411
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,336
Oh yeah?

412
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:53,307
OK.

413
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,308
Come on out, and fight.

414
00:19:58,879 --> 00:19:59,680
Darn it.

415
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:02,816
Where are these guys hiding?

416
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,332
-Noruto.

417
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:10,024
[music playing]

418
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:18,766
-That flute again.

419
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:19,927
Menma.

420
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:27,875
What's going on?

421
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:31,712
All of a sudden, I feel an
incredible surge of power.

422
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:33,507
All right.

423
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:37,318
It's unreal.

424
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:40,587
It's flowing through
my whole body.

425
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:50,564
-Not so fast.

426
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,933
-Check out this brat.

427
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,908
-Got him.

428
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,309
[gasps]

429
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,311
NARUTO: Substitution jutsu.

430
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:05,846
-Guess I spoke too soon.

431
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:10,617
-Naruto.

432
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:13,220
You OK?

433
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:17,758
-Menma That music you played.

434
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:19,059
What was it?

435
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:22,296
Just who the heck
are you, anyway?

436
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:23,297

MALE SPEAKER: That is
no ordinary young man.

439
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,465
FEMALE SPEAKER: What if he
turns his powers against us?

440
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,633
MALE SPEAKER: Stop it.

441
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,468
You're talking like Menma's
the enemy or something.

442
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:11,003
FEMALE SPEAKER: We;ve got
to be ready for anything.

443
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:13,005
MALE SPEAKER: He might be
another one of those bandits.

444
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,473
NARUTO: Don't be ridiculous.

445
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:17,476
Let's just take it easy until
he gets his memory back, OK?

446
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,744
-We can't wait.

447
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,480
We have to find out who he is,
and capture those intruders.

448
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:25,217
-You may trust this guy
Naruto, but we don't.

449
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:28,220
NARUTO: Next time,
"Bringing Back Reality."
