The Fuma are no
different than us.

00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,682
They love their clan
just like we do.

5
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,815
To play on people's
feelings like

6
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:05,315
that-- to take their
feelings of love and pride,

7
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,515
and twist them into
a force for evil.

How low can you get?

9
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,915
Get ready, Orochimaru,
because I'm coming

10
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,549
and I'm going to take you down.

-I don't get it.

The Pervy Sage got his butt
kicked by Lady Tsunade's

numbing medicine,
so how the heck

16
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,749
did he detect Sasame's
medicine this time around?

17
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:39,649
-Yeah, for Master Jiraiya,
that was pretty sharp thinking.

18
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,982
-Hey, hey, you both
heard Sasame talking

19
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:45,782
about how Hanzaki was
a traitor, didn't you?

20
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,949
That's how I figured it out.

21
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:53,849
By chance, Hanzaki told me
everything I needed to know.

22
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,915
-When Orochimaru first came to
this land, there was much talk.

23
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,749
Many among my people
wanted to use his power

to revive our clan.

25

Others saw his evil intentions.

26
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,749
We implored the rest not to
join forces with this person.

27
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,182
-Hm.

28
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,649
And that's why you were chased
out of your own village.

29
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,715
-Yes.

30
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,882
It was probably an
order from Orochimaru.

31
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:22,082
They said we were endangering
our clan and chased us away.

32
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,115
They called us traitors.

33
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,515
-So you see, the moment
that Sasame called Hanzaki

34
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,482
a traitor, I knew she
had gotten mixed up

35
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,349
with a group on
Orochimaru's side.

36
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,915
What are you doing?

37
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:45,949
-Wait, Pervy Sage.

38
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:48,315
Let's just calm down here, OK?

39
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,649
-No, I deserve this.

40
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:56,349
-But Sasame, you only did
this so you could find Arashi,

41
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,682
isn't that right?

42
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,382
-I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:05,215
I just thought this would be
the only thing I could do.

44
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,749
-Master Jiraiya,
Sasame just did what

45
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,215
she did because she
wanted to see her cousin.

46
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,882
You've got to forgive her.

47
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:12,882
-I'm with sakura.

48
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,415
Give her a break.

cannot be ignored.

-For the things
that she has done,

52
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,149
there must be
severe consequences.

53
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:26,982
Huh?

54
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,949
-Well then, I guess
you're just going

55
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:32,182
to have to punish me instead.

56
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,882
I made a promise,
I swore no matter

57
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:38,082
what, that I'd help Sasame
track down her cousin Arashi.

58
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,282
If I don't keep
my word, then I'll

59
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:42,782
have violated my ninja way.

60
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,782
-Me too, Master Jiraiya.

61
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,615
-Now take it easy.

62
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:50,549
I mean, it's not as if I'm
going to eat her alive.

63
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,949
Sasame, my dear, Hanzaki has
been quite worried about you.

64
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,915
He suspected you might
leave your village

65
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,882
to go look for Arashi.

66
00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,382
-Huh?

67
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,815
-After you take us to
Orochimaru's hideout,

68
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:17,349
you'll immediately be sent back
to the inn where Hanzaki is,

69
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,982
and wait there for us to return.

70
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:23,515
That shall be the
punishment for your actions.

71
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,882
-Master Jiraiya.

72
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:29,615
-I got to give you more
credit, Pervy Sage.

73
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:33,649
-Well, Hanzaki did treat me
to a lot of expensive stuff

74
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:36,215
at the Fuma Tavern, and
to pay him back for it,

75
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,182
he kind of asked me to
look after Sasame for him.

76
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,382
-Huh?!

77
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,682
-We should've known it
was something that sleazy.

-That's the last time
I give you any credit.

-Hey, hey, hey, cut me
some slack, all right?

Adults are allowed to take a
break at a tavern now and then.

-You've done your part.

83

Leave the rest to us.

-Careful, Sasame, on
your way back to the inn.

-Don't worry, OK?

quit until I bring Arashi back

to be the only entrance.

we'll be easy pickings.

else we can do but go find out.

JIRAIYA: Let's not be hasty.

101

Three big rats will
definitely attract attention.

102

So why don't we
send in a critter

00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,999
How about yours, Naruto?

161
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,099
-Sakura, careful where you step.

162
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:12,199
There's no telling what sort
of traps there might be.

163
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,699
-Yeah.

164
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:14,266
-Huh?

165
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,199
-Naruto, what?

166
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,599
Huh?

167
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:20,166
And you were the one who said
to be careful where you step.

168
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,132
-That trick floor was ingenious
No one could have seen it!

169
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,599
Aw man, what else
is going to happen?

-Naruto!

173
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:47,299
It's all my fault.

174
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,566
Naruto, no!

175
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,099
NARUTO: What the heck hit me?

176
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,799
I kind of stuck.

177
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,132
Give me a hand?

178
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,232
-You're alive?

179
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,632
Why'd you scream in
such a misleading way.

180
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,499
I thought you--

181
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,299
-Just help me, will you?

182
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,699
-Ugh, sometimes
you're so annoying.

183
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,799
-Ah, you saved me.

184
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,866
-You're welcome.

185
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,566
I'll take the lead from here.

00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,399
-Thanks, Naruto.

188

-It's going to be OK.

189
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:29,732
Just hold on.

-Don't worry about me.

197
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:12,620
I'm fine.

00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,020
You just get out of this trap

-But I--

NARUTO: I said go!

201
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,186
I promise I'll be
right behind you.

202

-Are you sure?

203
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,853
NARUTO (STRAINING):
Oh yeah, I'll

204
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,586
catch up with you in no time.

205
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,653
-You better catch up.

206
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:37,053
You made me a promise.

Hm, the sake

209
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,653
doesn't taste like it's
been tampered with.

210
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:49,353
So then what kind of
snare is she setting?

211
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,453
-Right.

212
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,820
You're from the
Sound Village, so you

213
00:13:56,853 --> 00:14:00,786
must be planning to use
some kind of music jutsu.

-I'm afraid this song
isn't only for our guests.

I'm also playing for myself.

-I see.

217
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:10,886
And what do you play when
you play from the heart?

218
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,420
-I composed this music to
accompany my own funeral.

You've underestimated
this Jiraiya-- [groaning]

-Escorting our guest
to the underworld

is my final mission before
I can go there as well.

-Just give me your hand.

We need to combine our chakra

-What are you talking about?

231
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:29,586
We can't stretch our

232
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,186
than we already have.

this far, Sakura.

-Isn't it ironic?

261
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:40,886
You dragged down your
team at the Chunin exam,

262
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,120
but now look at you.

You're the only person from
the Hidden Leaf Village

who is able to make it
this far into our compound.

-I'm not here by myself.

will be along any minute now.

-Enough about Sasuke.

270
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,620
If I were you, I'd be more
concerned about Naruto

271
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:03,820
and Jiraiya's well-being.

272
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,720
Or maybe not.

273
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,620
It may very well
be that those two

274
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:12,153
are no longer in this world.

-There's no way Master
Jiraiya and Naruto

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,586
would be taken down that easily.

278

-Oh, is that so?

279
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,053
Or could it be that you
dragged down Naruto again,

280
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:30,053
like you always do.

281
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,420

so worried, why

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,586
don't you go and check on him?

285
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,820
Or are you too
afraid of my attack

286
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,686
to come out from
behind that pillar?

Is that it?

288
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:52,320
Pathetic.

If someone as weak and slow
as you were on my team,

you can't take me.

It's about time I put
an end to this charade.

299
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,420
After all, I can't
keep Lord Orochimaru

while I play.

-There.

303

When this is all over, one
of us will have both scrolls,

304

and the other will be dead.

I'm a different person now.

308
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:32,586
I'm stronger.

-I can tell when you're
bluffing, my dear.

00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,553
And right now, you're
already finished.

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,117
What is this uneasy feeling?

318
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,950
My legs are weak and I don't
have any strength in my body.

319
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:12,684
I thought I was a different
person now, but I don't know.

320

Stop it.

00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,950
Calm down.

322
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:18,150
If these guys are here, it
means Sasuke must be nearby.
