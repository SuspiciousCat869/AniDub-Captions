[theme music]

2
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:56,691
-Shino, can we
take a break maybe?

3
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,363
We've been walking
since the sun came up.

4
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:01,435
I'm exhausted.

5
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,139
-If you have enough
energy to keep

6
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:05,143
groaning about
how tired you are,

7
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:08,517
it seems to me you
can't be that tired.

8
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,354
-Give me a break.

9
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:13,394
Just my luck to get stuck
having to do a mission alone

10
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:13,862
with Shino.

11
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:17,270
Huh?

12
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,288
Hey, old lady, are we getting
close to Motoyoshi Village.

13
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,559
-Is it Motoyoshi Village
you're headed to?

14
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,162
-That's right.

15
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,436
-Well, then, it's just
up ahead over that rise.

16
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:33,505
-Really?

17
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:34,641
What a relief.

18
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:39,552
-But be warned, you
must be very careful.

19
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:42,860
-Motoyoshi is a place
where even the dead laugh.

20
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,765
If you start laughing
too, you're finished.

21
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:56,824
-There it is, Naruto.

22
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:58,193
Motoyoshi Village.

23
00:02:58,193 --> 00:02:59,463
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Right then we

24
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,502
had no idea of the nightmare
we were getting into.

25
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:05,209
We hadn't even been told
what the mission was.

26
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:06,812
I suppose that
should have given us

27
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:09,351
a clue that things were
about to get scary.

28

[bell ding]

29
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,653
-Huh?

30
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:28,860
-Greetings.

31
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,799
I am Fuga Kagatsu.

32
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:31,667
-Shino Aburame.

33
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,707
And I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

34
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,649
-Shall we get right
down to business?

35
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:44,261
That is the final will of
Tobei Kagetsu, my dear father.

36
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:45,397
-A will, huh?

37
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:48,771
-In the event of my death,
my eldest son, Futa,

38
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:51,478
shall inherit the entire
Kagetsu family estate.

39
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,820
TSUNADE: Tomorrow
in Motoyoshi Village

40
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,261
there will be a funeral
for Tobie Kagetsu, the head

41
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,400
of a wealthy land
holding family.

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,935
I need you two to be there.

43
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,408
-A security detail, eh?

44
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,546
Why on earth would
you pick Naruto?

45
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,785
-What's that suppose to mean?

46
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:11,755
-I certainly wouldn't
want his goofy face

47
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,994
turning up at my funeral.

48
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:14,829
-Goofy what?

49
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,635
-I couldn't agree more.

50
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,040
Unfortunately ,
I have no choice.

51
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:23,782
No one else is free,
so it has to be Naruto.

52
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,953
But you're in charge
of the mission, Shino.

53
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,690
As you'll find out,
there are reasons

54
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,394
that you are especially
well-qualified.

55
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:36,076
This mission has some
rather unusual requirements.

56
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,717
You'll understand when
you read the will.

57
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,456
-However, if my son
Futa, the chief mourner,

58
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:46,465
should laugh at my funeral,
he forfeits all his rights

59
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:49,004
and the estate will be divided
among the other members

60
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,508
of the family.

61
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,445
-If he laughs at the funeral?

62
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:53,648
That's weird.

63
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,485
-The mountains my
family owns are

64
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,891
rich in valuable
medicinal herbs.

65
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,630
If I inherited the
estate, I'll live well

66
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:03,068
for the rest of my life.

67
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,009
But crack one laugh at my
father's funeral and I'm out.

68
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:09,449
The others in my family, I
know they'll do everything

69
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:12,657
in their power to make me
laugh at the funeral tomorrow.

70
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,928
I don't think I have
the strength to resist.

71
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,849
Luckily, for me, there's
a loophole in the will.

72
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:27,790
It says right there that I'm
allowed to find a substitute

73
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,493
to take my place
as chief mourner,

74
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:33,101
so that's what I asked the Leaf
Village to send me, a stand in.

75
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,741
Someone guaranteed not to laugh.

76
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,614
-Now, I see why this is a
perfect mission for him.

77
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,919
Don't worry, Mister,
Shino never laughs.

78
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:41,754
-Excellent.

79
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:44,660
Then I leave it to you.

80
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,102
-Understood.

81
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,641
-Futa, dinner is ready.

82
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:51,476
-This is Mai.

83
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,179
She is my youngest sister.

84
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,718
She lived with my
father here in his home.

85
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:59,493
She looked after him and
was with him at the end.

86
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,633
Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.

87
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,037
-It's nice to meet you.

88
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,546
-I'm starving, let's eat.

89
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:09,949
-Wait.

90
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,787
Let me taste it first.

91
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,090
-What do you mean?

92
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,960
Are you suggesting
that my relatives

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,599
would go so far as
to poison my food?

94
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,506
-Well, better safe than sorry.

95
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,444
-I suppose you're right.

96
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,716
-But if it is poisoned,
what about you?

97
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,856
-The parasitic insects within
me will break down any poisons

98
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,697
before it can cause
any serious damage.

99
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,103
-The, uh, parasitic insects?

100
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,867
-Well?

101
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,004
[chuckle]

102
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:53,579
-I guess it's all right.

103
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,817
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Did Shino just laugh?

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,211
-Well, he seems to
be in good spirits.

105
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,918
I guess that means the
food is all right then.

106
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,688
-No, don't eat it.

107
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:15,027
The way Shino's
laughing his head off,

108
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:17,264
there's something
definitely wrong.

109
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:20,171
-The food has some kind
of laughing drug in it.

110
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,784
-Who the heck
prepared this food?

111
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:28,121
-I did, but the backdoor
right next to the kitchen

112
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:29,592
is never locked.

113
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,599
Someone could have
come in at any time.

114
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:35,104
-That anyone in the
family would do this.

115
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:39,647
That my own flesh and blood
would try to poison me.

116
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,656
-Whatever the drug is,
it's affecting my insects.

117
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:44,993
It's no use.

118
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,262
They can't break it down.

119
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,865
-Well, then, what
are we going to do

120
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,805
about the funeral tomorrow?

121
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,809
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
OK, this is officially

122
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,948
starting to freak me out now!

123
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:58,622
-Naruto, there's no time
to contact the Leaf Village

124
00:07:58,656 --> 00:07:59,759
before the funeral tomorrow.

125
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,139
You'll have to do it.

126
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:11,985
You'll have to take my place
as a substitute mourner.

127
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,990
-No way.

128
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,596
-Well, Naruto, It's up to you.

129
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,703
But to be honest, I wonder if
you are the man for the job.

130
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:21,072
-Yeah, well, to be
honest, I'm kind

131
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:23,077
of wondering the same thing.

132
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,927
[laughing]

133
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,898
SHINO: Oh, please,
enough already.

134
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,203
How can I get any sleep?

135
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:42,653
-Ah, Tsukiko,
you're here already?

136
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,924
-Well, of course,
what did you think?

137
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,034
I'd be late for my
own father's funeral?

138
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,971
-Uh, who's the kid?

139
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,009
-I'm not feeling
very well, so I asked

140
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,147
Naruto to stand in
as chief mourner.

141
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,150
-Nice to meet you.

142
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:58,154
-Yes, I'm just
staying long enough

143
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,793
to say hello to everyone,
and then he'll take over.

144
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,063
-I see.

145
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,401
But wasn't that a
curious will Father left?

146
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:08,142
To think you lose everything
if the chief mourner laughs.

147
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:11,316
Good luck, young man.

148
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:14,356
-That's Tsukiko, the
oldest of my sisters.

149
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,897
She married into a rich
family from the next village.

150
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,334
But that's not enough for her.

151
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:22,708
She wants my father's
estate more than anyone.

152
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:24,145
-Little squirt.

153
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:27,819
This will be easy.

154
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:31,093
-So many greedy people.

155
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,830
You can see it in their eyes.

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,819
What's this?

157
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:54,979
-The priest has arrived.

158
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,451
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Did you have
to find the silliest looking

159
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:14,021
monk on the planet?

160
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,491
-I don't know
where he came from.

161
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,128
That's not the one I met before.

162
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,279
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Don't laugh.

163
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,453
Don't laugh.

164
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:30,958
[laughter]

165
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:32,897
-Very well then, let us begin.

166
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,994
-What on earth was that?

167
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:49,265
-The wind maybe.

168
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:53,141
-Young man, did I hear you
start to laugh just now?

169
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:53,976
-Who me?

170
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,446
Laugh at a funeral, no way.

171
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,052
-Mai, you heard him, didn't you?

172
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:00,290
-Ah, all I could hear was
that bucket falling over

173
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:03,564
or whatever it was.

174
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:04,900
-Oh, well.

175
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,403
TSUKIKO (VOICEOVER):
No need to worry.

176
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:10,145
The ceremony is just
beginning, plenty of time.

177
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,220
And my only obstacle is
this idiotic looking boy.

178
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,559
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I lucked out.

179
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:17,242
Huh?

180
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:23,073
Way to go, Shino.

181
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,075
Thanks.

182
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,815
-Oh, that was too
close for comfort.

183
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:32,495
[speaking japanese]

184
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,933
-You make come up
now one at a time.

185
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,403
-All right, I'll go first.

186
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,154
Ah!

187
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:46,091
ALL: Laugh Laugh.

188
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:47,326
Laugh.

189
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:49,031
-It's no use.

190
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,968
He's not laughing.

191
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,841
Let me see if I can't
push him over the edge.

192
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:55,111
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Don't laugh.

193
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,380
It's not funny.

194
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,518
Not funny.

195
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,391
MOURNER (VOICEOVER): Kid
thinks he's tough, but I've got

196
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,496
a trick that never fails.

197
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,200
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Suck it up, Naruto.

198
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,070
Whatever this
joker's got in mind,

199
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:09,309
you can't laugh no matter what.

200
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:13,651
-Ha, do it, Kiasu.

201
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,977
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Go on,
hit me with your best shot.

202
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,582
Can't make me laugh.

203
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:28,551
ALL: Laugh.

204
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,153
Laugh.

205
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:31,123
Laugh.

206
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,495
-Achoo!

207
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,065
Sorry, hay fever.

208
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,034
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): No.

209
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:36,510
No.

210
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,178
No.

211
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:37,645
ALL: Laugh.

212
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:38,514
Laugh. laugh.

213
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,269
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

214
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,204
Hold it in.

215
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,041
You can do it.

216
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:51,517
ALL: Laugh.

217
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,085
Laugh.

218
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,054
Laugh.

219
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:54,189
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
You can't laugh.

220
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,561
You cannot laugh,
whatever you do.

221
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:58,232
TSUKIKO (VOICEOVER):
He's a harder nut

222
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:00,304
to crack then I
would have thought,

223
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,577
but how much longer
can he hold out?

224
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:08,287
before thus funeral is
over, I will make him laugh.

225
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,746
-It's that old woman.

226
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,053
-Motoyoshi is a place
where even the dead laugh.

227
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:27,797
If you start laughing
too, you're finished.

228
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:31,505
-What's she doing
lurking around here?

229
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:32,507
-Who's there?

230
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,184
Oh, it's you, Mai.

231
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,612
[singing]

232
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,367
-This will do the trick.

233
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,077
Put a drop of this in everyone's
tea and it's all over.

234
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,380
-Yes, but--

235
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:06,483
-Take it, Mai.

236
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,217
It will work.

237
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:07,819
Don't worry.

238
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:08,587
[laughing]

239
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,622
-Huh?

240
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:10,491
-Not so fast.

241
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,094
-Whom might you be?

242
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:12,729
-It's Shino.

243
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:19,211
-I heard everything.

244
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,141
TSUKIKO (VOICEOVER):
What's wrong with him?

245
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,410
Why doesn't he laugh?

246
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:37,417
The estate is slipping
through my fingers.

247
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,588
-All right then, as
substitute chief mourner,

248
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:43,130
it is my duty and honor to
thank you all for coming.

249
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,903
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Mission accomplished.

250
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,208
-Ah, thank heavens.

251
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,678
I thought it would never end.

252
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:52,484
Once the priest leaves,
the funeral's over.

253
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,687
-Just a moment?

254
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,589
-Huh?

255
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:55,925
-If you wouldn't
mind, my husband

256
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,163
would like to thank you as well.

257
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:58,932
Go ahead, Darling.

258
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,857
-Thanks for the great funeral.

259
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:14,666
-Oh no.

260
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,668
What is he doing?

261
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:17,807
-That was the
bestest funeral ever.

262
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,751
It made me want to die
so I could have one too.

263
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:23,786
So sad.

264
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,688
So moving.

265
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:33,340
I can't believe that
idiot would stoop to this.

266
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,543
Be strong, Naruto.

267
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:36,447
Don't let them break you.

268
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,819
It's almost over.

269
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:40,456
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
It's not working.

270
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,427
Think of something else.

271
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,397
Something sad.

272
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,603
Something not funny at all.

273
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:47,606
Wrong!

274
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,476
Not Pervy Sage.

275
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:50,512
TSUKIKO (VOICEOVER): Yes.

276
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,583
He's almost there.

277
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,587
-I can't stop crying.

278
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,391
I'm melting.

279
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:57,293
Melting.

280
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:58,963
-Oh, that's all right, Darling.

281
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:02,004
Don't worry, you haven't
another one right here.

282
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:08,919
-Oh, no.

283
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,826
-We've got him.

284
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:12,427
Hm?

285
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:15,433
Huh?

286
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,286
Father?

287
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,623
-This is impossible.

288
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:26,692
Father's alive?

289
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:27,627
-Stop it.

290
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,766
Brothers and
sisters don't fight.

291
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,569
Papa doesn't like
it when we fight.

292
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:32,538
-Get out of here.

293
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:33,841
My joke was funny.

294
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,277
-You get out.

295
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,847
My joke was funnier.

296
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:38,551
-Who are those kids?

297
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:39,621
What's going on?

298
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:42,360
-Yeah, well, how come
my joke made dad laugh?

299
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:45,266
-He was laughing at my joke.

300
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:45,801
-Cut it out!

301
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,571
It's wrong to fight.

302
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,475
-Ha, Mai is right.

303
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,745
Fighting is wrong.

304
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,749
Listen to your little sister.

305
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:53,350
Futa.

306
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:55,321
Tsukiko.

307
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:57,760
-Futa.

308
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,463
-You mean, they're
supposed to be--

309
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:00,834
-Yes, of course.

310
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:04,609
They're us when we were kids.

311
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:06,813
-Ha, fighting very wrong.

312
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:10,488
Don't make me scratch this
gong. 'Cuz when I hear it gong,

313
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,626
I have to sing a song.

314
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,733
When I hear a gong or
bing, a silly song I sing.

315
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,840
It doesn't mean a thing,
this silly song I song.

316
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,377
The cat took all it's gold.

317
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,981
The fox is really old.

318
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:25,755
The queen was polishing
the anvils of the king.

319
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:29,096
Fundle dingle dong,
won't you sing along.

320
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,738
You cannot get it wrong
'cuz it's just a silly song.

321
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,443
-Yes, I remember it so well.

322
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:38,517
Our father used to make us
laugh with those idiotic songs

323
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,084
of his.

324
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,923
-I'd almost forgotten.

325
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:43,828
It seems like such
a long time ago.

326
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,764
-Yes, yes.

327
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,871
This is what I wanted to see.

328
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:49,341
ALL: Huh?

329
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:49,823
What?

330
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,058
-It's Father.

331
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,895
-But then, who is that?

332
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,374
-At last.

333
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,777
I've stopped laughing.

334
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:06,913
-Shino.

335
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:09,685
-Forgive me for having
put you all through this.

336
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,155
I came up with
this little scheme

337
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,928
and Mai helped me pull it off.

338
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:16,835
I knew the only way I could
bring you all together

339
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:18,472
is to stage my funeral.

340
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:19,908
-Is that really you, Father?

341
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,679
You're alive and well?

342
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:22,447
-But why?

343
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,651
I don't understand.

344
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:29,162
-To remind you of what we used
to be like before our lands

345
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:30,565
made us rich.

346
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,977
We were poor then, but how
loudly we used to laugh.

347
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,917
Once we learned how
valuable the herbs were

348
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,823
that grew on our mountains,
everything changed.

349
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:44,062
There was no more
laughter, only cries

350
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,502
of money, money, more money.

351
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:51,110
None of us ever even really
smiled again after that.

352
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:54,150
I wanted to remind the family
of what we'd forgotten.

353
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,121
What's important.

354
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:59,930
I wanted to see a smile
on our faces again.

355
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:01,967
I knew if I wrote
that ridiculous will,

356
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:05,208
everyone would go crazy
trying to make Futa laugh.

357
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,113
Then, perhaps, the
forced laughter

358
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,219
would turn into real
laughter, real joy.

359
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,825
Happiness has nothing
to do with wealth.

360
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,133
It's about being a family,
loving and caring and laughing.

361
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:21,611
-I remember, Father.

362
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,613
-Oh.

363
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:25,953
-I want the laughter
back in my life.

364
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,257
-You're right.

365
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,927
Quite frankly, it
will be a relief

366
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,533
not to live at the mercy
of money all the time.

367
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:32,736
-This I've got to see.

368
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,007
Money is all you
ever cared about.

369
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,012
-Well, I;m singing a
different tune now.

370
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,149
How does it go again?

371
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:40,819
Ding dong ding or something.

372
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:58,926
NARUTO: Is that
what I think it is?

373
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,131
SHINO: The laughing drug.

374
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,937
-It's still experimental.

375
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,811
I knew if Futa could pick
a substitute chief mourner

376
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,815
to take his place,
he'd find someone

377
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:10,786
who's almost
incapable of laughing,

378
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,229
and that would be the
perfect person to test it on.

379
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:19,005
If there'd been no laughter by
the time the funeral was almost

380
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,644
over, I was going to put
this in everyone's tea

381
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:22,779
as a last resort.

382
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:23,681
But then--

383
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:30,129
-What's the point of
chemically induced laughter.

384
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,932
Laughter that doesn't
come from the heart

385
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:33,202
isn't laughter at all.

386
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:41,219
It's the sound of
someone in agony.

387
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:42,823
Like I am now.

388
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:51,309
-So technically, did we
accomplish our mission?

389
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,046
-I believe we did.

390
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,823
I suspect the hokage knew what
the real mission was all along.

391
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,061
-Say, while you were
posing as the old man,

392
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,698
did you really
come up with that?

393
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:03,001
I mean, seriously.

394
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:06,074
All that dongity ding, the
bongity bing stuff was yours?

395
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:07,044
Ya!

396
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:09,583
-Not a word.

397
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,854
It never happened.

398
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,591
Understand?

399
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,994
-Right, never happened.

400
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:15,796
Got it.

401
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:16,279
-Good.

402
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,344
-Shino, man, you
really are a joy

403
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:24,181
to work with, you know that?

404
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:32,166
[theme music]

405
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:01,997
-I need you in
the Land of Greens

406
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:03,433
for some important escort duty.

407
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,302
NARUTO: Important?

408
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,207
It's a lousy team rank mission.

409
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,476
TSUNADE: Listen you.

410
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:09,914
Their chief has been very
good to me so watch your step.

411
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:12,215
NARUTO: Ah, I can do
this mission in my sleep.

412
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:15,285
TSUNADE: Well, don't, you've
done enough like that already.

413
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,753
Oh, and there's one more thing.

414
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:17,754
NARUTO: What?

415
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:18,855
TSUNADE: Something
you must not forget

416
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:21,124
to take with you,
no matter what.

417
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:23,894
NARUTO: Next time,
"Open for Business,

418
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,996
The Leaf Moving Service."
