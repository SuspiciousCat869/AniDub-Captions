1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,240
[theme song]

2
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,453
-You've got to help me, sensei!

3
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,103
[scream]

4
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,406
-What?

5
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:25,712
-Ah!

6
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,808
My heart, my heart!

7
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:32,747
What the?

8
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,315
I can't believe I'm still alive.

9
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,984
-Hey, what are you doing here?

10
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:39,253
Using a transformation
jutsu, huh?

11
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:42,456
-Would somebody like to tell
me what just happened in there?

12
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,858
-Just shut up.

13
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,359
If you know what's
good for you you'll

14
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,094
forget about what you just saw.

15
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,234
-Hey!

16
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:55,970
You're Yakumo, aren't you?

17
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,471
I came out here
because I want to ask

18
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:59,240
you some questions
about Kurenai-sensei.

19
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:05,846
Darn it.

20
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,967
Wait a sec.

21
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,969
Is this a hallway
in the academy?

22
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,808
YAKUMO: Sensei, please.

23
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:52,359
Tell me why you don't
think I'm good enough.

24
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:54,295
-Kurenai-sensei?

25
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:57,431
-I want to become a ninja
more than anything in my life.

26
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:59,700
I just have to become one!

27
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,102
-I already told you,
you should give up.

28
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:04,104
-I can't!

29
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:07,141
-Then I'll have to
perform a sealing jutsu.

30
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:10,945
If I seal your power
you can't keep going.

31
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:11,779
-Huh?

32
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,747
Hey, Kurenai-sensei!

33
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,282
Why are you being like this?

34
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:18,953
[loud banging]

35
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:20,254
[scream]

36
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:31,365
Oh.

37
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:32,967
Hey, Sakura.

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,737
Um, question-- where am I?

39
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,074
And how the heck did I
wind up lying in bed?

40
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,242
Wait, I know.

41
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,244
Kurenai-sensei got
stabbed, and my heart

42
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:45,246
was pulled out of my chest.

43
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,248
No, that's not it.

44
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,749
Where's that girl?

45
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:51,452
You know, Yakumo?

46
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:54,054
-You don't remember
any of it, do you?

47
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,957
You got caught red-handed
breaking into a safe house

48
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:00,294
in the mountains, you idiot!

49
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,363
The Anbu black ops got you.

50
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,964
You should be counting
your lucky stars

51
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:06,700
you're even alive right now.

52
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,136
-Oh, that's right!

53
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,040
But that dream I had-- it
felt like it really happened.

54
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,909
Maybe Yakumo's the
one they're guarding

55
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,210
in that villa, or something.

56
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:18,712
-What in the world are
you blabbing about?

57
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:22,950
I'm gonna give you a shot if you
don't start making sense soon.

58
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:25,386
-I can't just sit
here doing nothing.

59
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,155
-Get back here, Naruto!

60
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,958
The medicine hasn't
worn off yet!

61
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,335
-Hey, sensei!

62
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:43,437
Open up, will ya?

63
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,705
-Don't waste your time.

64
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,407
She already left.

65
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,909
Hey, since you're
up so early anyway,

66
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:52,146
what do you say you join me
for an early morning marathon?

67
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:54,381
-This ain't exactly
the best time.

68
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,717
-Early morning
marathons are great.

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,286
All that healthy
marathon sweat purges

70
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,722
impurities that might
build up in your body

71
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:03,257
over a night of sleep.

72
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,858
-Yeah.

73
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,127
Listen, can you tell me where
Kurenai-sensei ran off to?

74
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:10,097
-Come to think of it, she didn't
mention paying someone a visit.

75
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,999
Something about a
former student of hers

76
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,401
who was in pretty bad shape.

77
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:16,070
-She means Yakumo.

78
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:19,340
-At least join me for my
morning stretch routine.

79
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,075
All that healthy,
stretching sweat

80
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,876
purges impurities
that might build up

81
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,878
in your body over a
long night of sleep.

82
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:38,192
-Kurenai-sensei, wait up!

83
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:38,859
Whoa!

84
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:47,368
Before you go any further, I
just gotta ask you something.

85
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:48,836
-Naruto.

86
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,471
You'd be smart if you
turned around right now

87
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:51,805
and left this thing alone.

88
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,840
-Listen to me.

89
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,408
Yesterday I went to see Yakumo.

90
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,043
And maybe this is
somehow related,

91
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:59,179
but I just had this crazy
dream that seemed so real.

92
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:00,247
-A dream?

93
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,415
-Yeah.

94
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:02,883
You were telling me
Yakumo that you'd

95
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,418
use a sealing jutsu on
her unless she gave up

96
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:08,389
her goal of becoming a ninja.

97
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,256
-Sorry.

98
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:10,391
I'm in a hurry.

99
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,258
-Huh?

100
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,860
Hey, hold on a sec!

101
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,194
-This is none of your business.

102
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:17,831
-Sorry.

103
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm making it my business.

104
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,036
Something weird's gotta
be going on with you.

105
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,837
Hinata, Kiba and
Shino are freaking out

106
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,407
because you said
you're quitting.

107
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,142
You honestly gonna
look me in the eye

108
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,978
and try to convince me
that Yakumo has nothing

109
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:32,813
to do with you
quitting squad eight?

110
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:40,154
-What you experienced earlier
wasn't just a realistic dream.

111
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,994
I did use a sealing
jutsu on her.

112
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:50,097
I took away my own
student's power.

113
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,232
-I don't get it.

114
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:54,401
How could you do that?

115
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:57,137
-It all happened a
little over a year ago.

116
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,141
With my own hands I crushed her
dream of becoming a shinobi.

117
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:06,480
Up until then I'd been giving
her special one-on-one training

118
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:09,149
to unlock her hidden genjutsu.

119
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,351
-You're kidding me!

120
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,986
-But I failed her.

121
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,292
I can't be trusted with the
lives of the squad eight ninja.

122
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:21,895
-But why did you do it?

123
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,831
-This discussion is over.

124
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:26,133
Now if you'll please
get out of my way.

125
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,034
-Wait, that's it?

126
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,303
But I still have so much to ask!

127
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,170
-I have no choice.

128
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:42,082
-What the heck is
going on around here?

129
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:54,695
I can't break free.

130
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,964
Kurenai-sensei!

131
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:59,066
Now you're just bring cruel!

132
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,943
-We're already surrounded.

133
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,146
Send an alert to the village.

134
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:12,846
-Sir.

135
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:19,119
-There they are!

136
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,394
-What the?

137
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,218
-Take this message.

138
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:02,863
Fly quickly.

139
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,264
You must warn the Hokage.

140
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:51,345
-Miss Yakumo, we have
orders to take you in.

141
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,711
-Can you believe that guy?

142
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,978
That jerk could have
at least thanked me

143
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:28,897
for sitting by his
bedside all night long.

144
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,357
Huh?

145
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,632
[scream]

146
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,638
-Can't I take a break?

147
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,207
What about afternoon tea?

148
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,411
-Only after you've taken
care of all these documents.

149
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,513
-What's up with all
this paperwork, anyway?

150
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,081
How'd we get this backed up?

151
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,985
-Because someone doesn't
like to do her work promptly.

152
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,654
-It's a carrier pigeon
with an urgent message!

153
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,322
-What?

154
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,395
It's from the safe
house on Satomi Hill.

155
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,431
Something has
happened to Yakumo!

156
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,483
We've just received
an important alert.

157
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,552
Yakumo, a girl under
Leaf Village protection,

158
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,120
may have been kidnapped.

159
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,522
You will head to the
villa in the Satomi hills.

160
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:40,360
Your mission is to get Yakumo.

161
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:40,994
-Hm.

162
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,562
Yakumo Kurama.

163
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,732
As I recall she's the girl
Kurenai was taking care of,

164
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,766
wasn't she?

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,401
-Mm.

166
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:53,106
The only daughter of Murakumo,
the head of the Kurama clan.

167
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,175
-Um, excuse me, but
who's the Kurama clan?

168
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,243
-Right.

169
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,645
You kids probably
don't know about them.

170
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,446
They were once a
distinguished clan

171
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,016
that wielded a lot of
power in the village.

172
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,251
But they've lost
much of their status.

173
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,287
The whole mess
started a year ago.

174
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,156
They lost the leader of
their family, Murakumo,

175
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,325
along with his beloved wife.

176
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,128
And after that the rest of the
clan pretty much fell apart.

177
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,597
-And now the only daughter
of the head of the clan

178
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,698
is kidnapped.

179
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,233
Do you think that
means someone's

180
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,703
trying to steal the Kurama's
secret family jutsu?

181
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,105
-That may be.

182
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,208
-According to records handed
down from the third Hokage

183
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,278
there is a huge power lying
dormant within Yakumo,

184
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,648
one that is extremely dangerous.

185
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,650
-That means if
someone can figure out

186
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:41,988
how to awaken her powers she
would become a powerful weapon.

187
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,990
And where there's
power to be had

188
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,693
you can bet somebody
will try to get it.

189
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,528
-Ever since the
death of her parents

190
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,763
we've been keeping
Yakumo under lock and key

191
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,632
for her own protection.

192
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,499
-Right.

193
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,734
I'm on the case.

194
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,303
A damsel in distress
is a job for me.

195
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,972
The beautiful green
beast Might Guy

196
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,608
will come to her rescue,
no matter the danger.

197
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,977
-Sakura, you'd
better go with him.

198
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,511
-What?

199
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,646
-Huh?

200
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,047
-Once we have Yakumo
in custody we'll

201
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,682
need someone to look
after her condition.

202
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,618
Preferably someone who's been
trained as a medical ninja.

203
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,287
-Uh-- yes!

204
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,991
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Finally I get

205
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,626
the chance to put
all my training

206
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,329
to use on a real mission.

207
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:23,786
-Ah!

208
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,071
Ow.

209
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,339
-Are you OK?

210
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,643
Did you trip on a
root or something?

211
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,511
-What in the world?

212
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,387
-Naruto?

213
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,189
-Leave it to Naruto to
fall asleep in the bushes.

214
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,297
-Nice, Akamaru.

215
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,402
HINATA (VOICEOVER): Oh, Naruto.

216
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,642
-Wait a second.

217
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,077
I think he's under a genjutsu.

218
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,118
Release.

219
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,132
-Sakura?

220
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,004
That's salty!

221
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,306
What the heck is on my face?

222
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,274
What's going on?

223
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,975
Did I just fall asleep again?

224
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,144
-Could you please stop babbling.

225
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,414
-Apparently somebody
used genjutsu on you.

226
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,115
-Genjutsu?

227
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,054
The last thing I remember
was chasing Kurenai-sensei

228
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,989
toward that villa
on Satomi Hill.

229
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,258
She wouldn't even
stop and listen to me.

230
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,394
-The villa on Satomi Hill?

231
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,597
Naruto, was Kurenai
travelling there by herself?

232
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,565
-Yeah, probably.

233
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,370
-She has no idea what
she's getting herself into.

234
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,371
Kurenai's in danger.

235
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,217
KURENAI (VOICEOVER):
This doesn't feel right.

236
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,991
Someone's here.

237
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,259
Darn it.

238
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,595
I should have known
better than to come alone.

239
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,264
But now there's no time
to return to the village.

240
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,500
What could they want here?

241
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,167
Yakumo!

242
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,645
-It's trapping me!

243
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,734
-Sorry to tie you up like this,
but we can't have nosy people

244
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,536
like you interfering
with our work.

245
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,678
-Did you really think that
was enough to ensnare me?

246
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,213
-What?

247
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,649
-Sorry, but you're the
one who's getting tied up.

248
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,425
These enemies have genjutsu.

249
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,460
If I'm going to live
I'd better be careful.

250
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,668
What is this presence?

251
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,560
They're both caught in
some sort of genjutsu.

252
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,004
[crying]

253
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,472
-Yakumo?

254
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,008
Yakumo, is that you?

255
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,010
[crying]

256
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:30,963
Thank goodness you're alive.

257
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:37,436
-Please help me!

258
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,373
-It'll be all right.

259
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,609
I'm here now.

260
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,444
No matter what
happens, I promise

261
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,945
I'll make sure you're safe.

262
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:47,946
-Oh, Kurenai-sensei.

263
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:55,554
Ah.

264
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:07,163
-Release.

265
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:16,809
You were hit with
a reverse genjutsu?

266
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,010
-Sir.

267
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,877
I'm sorry.

268
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:20,846
-Probably a jonin.

269
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,982
In fact it sounds exactly
like Kurenai Yuhi.

270
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:27,953
Everyone, watch out.

271
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,755
They'll be coming for us.

272
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:31,924
Leaf Village ninja
are on their way.

273
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:32,624
-Sir!

274
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:40,799
They two who went to get
Yakumo haven't returned yet.

275
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,867
MAN (VOICEOVER): Oh well.

276
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,404
Then I guess violence
can't be avoided.

277
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:47,606
-Forget that you come
from the same clan.

278
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,776
Take out that girl by
any means necessary.

279
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:51,710
Got it?

280
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:52,174
-Right!

281
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:58,383
-Hey, what's the matter, Hinata?

282
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,518
-Did you see something?

283
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,755
-Somebody's attacking
that mountain villa

284
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,757
right this very minute.

285
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,527
There are four out
front and four inside.

286
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,429
-I wonder if two of
the people inside

287
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:11,597
might be Kurenai and Yakumo.

288
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,032
-Yeah, I bet you're
right about that.

289
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,501
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Kurenai-sensei,

290
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,669
what have you gotten
yourself into?

291
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,674
Tell us what's going on!

292
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,617
[theme song]

293
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,608
KURENAI (VOICEOVER):
I'm surprised.

294
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:04,876
I never would have thought
the enemy would turn out

295
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,612
to be you, of all people.

296
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:10,716
Whatever your reasons may
be, you're not taking Yakumo.

297
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:12,351
Don't you see?

298
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,886
The third Hokage entrusted
me with her life.

299
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,522
Even if you are lethal
masters of genjutsu,

300
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:21,493
I'll use all my powers
to protect this child.

301
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:24,363
NARUTO: Next time-- Kurenai's
Top Secret Mission--

302
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:26,832
The Promise With
The Third Hokage!
