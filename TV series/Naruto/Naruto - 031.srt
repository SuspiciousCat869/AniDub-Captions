[theme song]

2
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,968
-Why are you here?

3
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,437
-Disappointed?

4
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,275
I expected a friendlier
reception after all this time.

5
00:01:56,308 --> 00:02:00,047
-Don't tell me you've come here
to assassinate Lord Hokage.

6
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,815
-No, not yet.

7
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,552
I don't have quite enough
followers to attempt that.

8
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:07,021
But I've heard such good
things about this village,

9
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:09,992
I thought I might
want to make it mine.

10
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,496
[moaning]

11
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:16,066
Oh, it's the mark, isn't it?

12
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,270
I put that same curse
mark on a young man

13
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:21,238
just a little while ago.

14
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,009
Very promising prospect.

15
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,078
-You haven't changed, I see.

16
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:29,115
He'll die before he serves you.

17
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,717
OROCHIMARU: Very possibly.

18
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,354
I'd say the odds are
1 in 10 against him.

19
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,958
But the kid may
survive as you did.

20
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:41,397
-It sounds like you
want him badly, huh?

21
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,398
OROCHIMARU: Oh, jealous?

22
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:45,168
Is that it?

23
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:48,138
You can't forgive me can
you for using you and then

24
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,140
tossing you aside.

25
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:56,148
In some ways, the boy has even
more potential than you had.

26
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:58,518
You see, he's inherited
the sublime abilities

27
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:01,254
of the Uchiha clan.

28
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:03,991
And his physical
condition is excellent.

29
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:08,931
Yes, he might very well be
the heir I'm looking for.

30
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,867
At the very least, he
makes thing interesting.

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,639
Whatever happens, make sure
no one stops the exams early.

32
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:19,009
Three of my followers
are also candidates.

33
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,748
I look forward to
seeing how they fare.

34
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,688
Bear this in mind,
if anything happens

35
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,424
to deprive me of
my fun, it means

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,627
the end of the Leaf Village.

37
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:54,553
-All right, that's enough
resting up, I think.

38
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,722
The other teams will be
calling it a day soon.

39
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:02,462
And that means it's
time to strike.

40
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,300
You know the plan, we
split up and fan out.

41
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,036
Whatever happens, whether we
make contact with another team

42
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,473
or not, we meet up
back here in this spot.

43
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,510
Got it?

44
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:14,844
-No sweat.

45
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,313
-Roger.

46
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,649
-All right then, let's move.

47
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,760
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Bushy Brow's Pledge:

48
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,229
Undying Love and Protection.

49
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,039
-[sigh].

50
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:24,963
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): No,
I can't fall asleep.

51
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,069
I have to protect these two.

52
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,519
-Oh, wow.

53
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:43,420
I slept really great.

54
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:43,986
-Naruto.

55
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:48,726
Sasuke.

56
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,162
-Did you take care of
us this whole time?

57
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:51,996
-Thanks, Sakura.

58
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,402
We're all better because of you.

59
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,304
-I'm glad you're OK.

60
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,677
[rustling]

61
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,947
-Now you'll see what
it's like to be prey,

62
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,218
panicking and frantically
running away from a predator.

63
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:12,756
And that predator is me!

64
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,770
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
My voice is gone.

65
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,973
All our voices are gone.

66
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,819
It was just a dream.

67
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:46,530
Oh, I can't believe
it's daytime already.

68
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:48,399
[rustling]

69
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:49,366
Oh, no.

70
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,253
A squirrel?

71
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:09,191
Oh man, don't surprise
me like that, little guy.

72
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,697
That was too close.

73
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,100
-I thought for sure
that would work.

74
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:20,238
Do you think she saw the paper
bomb we put on the squirrel?

75
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,007
-No, that wasn't it.

76
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:23,642
-Hm.

77
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:24,777
Then what was it?

78
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,111
What are you thinking?

79
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,783
-I'm thinking we need to
go closer and find out.

80
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,984
So let's get going.

81
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:46,971
-Hm.

82
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:54,045
OK, if I can catch
all 20 of those leaves

83
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,548
before they hit the
ground, then Sakura

84
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,084
will fall in love with me.

85
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:02,122
But if I cannot, then she
will never return my feelings.

86
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:05,827
That is the challenge I
am going to give myself.

87
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,829
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Those
eyebrows are so bushy.

88
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,231
You're such a weirdo.

89
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,667
LEE (VOICEOVER): I cannot
believe she said that.

90
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,904
I will show her I am worthy.

91
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:17,074
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

92
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,776
Yes, I am going to get them all.

93
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,277
Ooh.

94
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:22,915
19.

95
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:25,884
One left.

96
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,486
Hm, what is that?

97
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,434
Phew, that was close.

98
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:43,172
This paper bomb explodes after
a certain amount of time.

99
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,308
Who would do such
an awful thing?

100
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,788
-All right, stop
hiding and come out.

101
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:56,756
-Shoot.

102
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,358
How could he have seen us?

103
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,593
We hid so fast.

104
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,161
-What a drag.

105
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:03,430
Now that he's found us out,
this is going to be such a pain.

106
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:04,532
-It's no big deal.

107
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:07,202
Our hide and hangout
strategy didn't work,

108
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,738
so we'll just use
strategy number two.

109
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,773
-What!

110
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:13,843
Are you serious, Ino?

111
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:15,645
-You got a problem with that?

112
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,983
-Trust me, this plan can't fail.

113
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,588
-Well, what do we got to lose?

114
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,989
-Ha-ha.

115
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,292
Wow, imagine running into
last year's number one

116
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,162
rookie, Neji Hyuga, out here.

117
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,799
-Can I have your autograph?

118
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:32,900
-Oh, it's you guys.

119
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,235
-Yeah.

120
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,405
Strategy two, where you
fall head-over-heels in

121
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:38,240
love with my beauty.

122
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,642
Hi, there.

123
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:43,579
I've been wanting to meet you
for a really long time, Neji.

124
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:44,581
So, hi.

125
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,782
-Get lost.

126
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,151
INO (VOICEOVER): What!

127
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:50,522
He should have been
bowled over by my beauty.

128
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,057
Why didn't that work?

129
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,296
Ugh, it makes me so angry
I could just hit something.

130
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,766
-Did you just raise
your fist to me?

131
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,268
Does that mean
you want to fight?

132
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:04,505
-No.

133
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,040
No way.

134
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:07,676
Of course not.

135
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:09,211
-Go away.

136
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:12,849
Even if I were to steal a
scroll from you cowardly wimps,

137
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,218
everybody would just
laugh at me for it.

138
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:17,888
-Sounds good to me.

139
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:21,493
-Ha, they scurry off
like cockroaches.

140
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:26,165
[breathing heavily]

141
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:27,767
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
Just as I thought,

142
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,004
someone like him wouldn't take
a scroll from people like us,

143
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,741
unless we turned on
him and attacked.

144
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:36,044
-All right.

145
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,415
Let's see if we can
find some weaklings.

146
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:44,120
-Yeah, well, I doubt we'll
find anyone weaker than us.

147
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,001
DOSU: Some lookout.

148
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,537
You're half asleep.

149
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,108
At least you don't have
to keep watch anymore.

150
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:04,212
What's the point after
we've already found you?

151
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:05,714
Now, wake Sasuke up.

152
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:07,182
We want to fight him.

153
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,418
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): You'll
never get him, you jerks.

154
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,857
What do you want here?

155
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,692
I mean, what do you really want?

156
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:19,664
I know Orochimaru was calling
the shots from the shadows.

157
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:24,136
What's that strange bruise
on the back of Sasuke's neck?

158
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,738
You're behind this,
too, aren't you?

159
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,008
And now you want to fight him
when he can't defend himself?

160
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,645
-What in the world
could he be thinking?

161
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,417
-I can't stay
quiet after hearing

162
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,320
you talk to us like that.

163
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:40,957
First, I'm going
to kill this girl,

164
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,725
and then I'm going
to kill Sasuke.

165
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,333
-Wait, Zaku.

166
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:49,768
-What?

167
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:50,301
Why?

168
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,875
-It's so obvious.

169
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:58,979
This is the color of dirt
that's recently been dug up.

170
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:04,519
And this kind of grass doesn't
grow in a place like this.

171
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:06,488
You know, if you're
going to lay a trap,

172
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:11,928
there's no point unless you
make sure it's actually hidden.

173
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:14,498
-Ha, you're just a joke.

174
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,001
You threw your kunai knife,
so that squirrel wouldn't

175
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,104
spring the trap you set, huh?

176
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:23,342
-Now we kill her.

177
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,044
-Hm.

178
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,045
-A log.

179
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,448
-She also laid a trap above?

180
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,716
Watch out!

181
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,487
Nice try, little girl.

182
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:36,891
Clearly, you have no
talent as a ninja.

183
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:40,630
Someone like you needs to make
a little more of an effort,

184
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:42,298
don't you think?

185
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:43,499
LEE: Leaf hurricane.

186
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:51,209
What?

187
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,845
What's he doing?

188
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:56,716
-Looks like you also need
to make more of an effort.

189
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,418
-Who are you?

190
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,188
-I am the handsome devil
of the Leaf Village,

191
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:03,424
and my name is Rock Lee.

192
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,510
-Wha-- what are you
doing here, Lee?

193
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:22,414
-I will always appear,
anytime and anywhere

194
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,349
that you are in trouble, Sakura.

195
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,690
This was really all
thanks to you, little one.

196
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:32,593
But now it is time
for you to run along.

197
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,138
-But right now on this
test, I'm your enemy.

198
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,941
-Sakura, I already told you.

199
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:45,976
-Huh?

200
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,778
-I will protect you until I die.

201
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:54,086
Please be my girlfriend.

202
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,489
I vow to protect
you with my life.

203
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,160
-Yes.

204
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,363
Thank you, Rock Lee.

205
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:03,331
LEE (VOICEOVER): Yes.

206
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:04,298
She said yes!

207
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:06,801
Guy sensei, she said yes!

208
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:13,243
DOSU: It looks like
I have no choice.

209
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:16,914
Zaku, I'll let you have Sasuke.

210
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:20,152
I'll take care of these two.

211
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:21,453
LEE (VOICEOVER):
It does not look

212
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,623
like Sakura is in any
condition to fight.

213
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,359
-That guy with
the bushy eyebrows

214
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,194
is pretty good at taijutsu.

215
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,730
It looks like I get
to have some fun.

216
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,210
LEE (VOICEOVER): I am
positive that there

217
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:42,812
is some kind of
trick to your attack.

218
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:46,984
Therefore, I will not waste
my time trying to dodge it.

219
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,252
-Huh?

220
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:49,553
-After all, I have
seen your jutsu before.

221
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,960
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Wow, he's tough.

222
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,862
LEE (VOICEOVER): Of
course, having said that,

223
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,234
my odds still are not good
since it is three against one.

224
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,170
I have to take a chance.

225
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:04,906
One at a time.

226
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:07,475
I will attack each of
them with all my might.

227
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,855
-Oh, man.

228
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:21,092
There doesn't seem to be anyone
around who's weaker than us.

229
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:22,561
-Not so fast.

230
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:25,231
I still think that Naruto's
team might actually

231
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:26,533
be weaker than we are.

232
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,368
-Take that back
right now, you jerk.

233
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,637
-What do you mean?

234
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,406
-There's no doubt Naruto
and Sakura are lame,

235
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,442
but I won't have you
bad mouthing Sasuke.

236
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,343
He's awesome.

237
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:36,845
-Yeah, whatever.

238
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:40,015
Maybe your precious
Sasuke is better in theory

239
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,753
than in practice.

240
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:43,954
-[grunting].

241
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:48,325
-All right, all right, I
apologize if I upset you.

242
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,328
What a drag.

243
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:52,931
I say one little negative
thing about Sasuke

244
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:56,836
and I get the evil eye from
his number one fan here.

245
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,739
-There is no way Sasuke
could lose a battle.

246
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:00,674
Ha.

247
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,142
But Sakura is a
different matter.

248
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:08,750
-Hm?

249
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:11,120
Hey, Sasuke has collapsed.

250
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:11,754
-Hm?

251
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:12,589
-Huh?

252
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,557
CHOJI: And Sakura's fighting.

253
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,826
INO: What did you say?

254
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:21,366
Hm.

255
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,269
Ah.

256
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:26,339
Oh, he's late.

257
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:27,874
And he's never late.

258
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:33,581
Lee is-- well, fanatical
about being on time.

259
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:37,385
Maybe he ran into the enemy.

260
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:40,289
You think--

261
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:42,826
-No, I'm sure he's all right.

262
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,329
But still, we'd
better go find him.

263
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:45,930
-Right.

264
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,774
-Yes, I did it.

265
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:57,244
I finally mastered the jutsu.

266
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:58,545
-Enough resting.

267
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:00,213
You're wasting your
precious, gifted youth.

268
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:11,227
GUY (VOICEOVER): This
jutsu, in the end

269
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,396
only Lee could make it his own.

270
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:14,164
-I did it.

271
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,031
-Lee.

272
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:15,499
-I actually did it.

273
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:16,733
-Lee.

274
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:17,935
-After all that practice,
I pulled it off.

275
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:18,936
-Lee.

276
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,771
-I guess if I just
try hard enough--

277
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:20,438
-Lee!

278
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,339
-I can do anything.

279
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,508
Wow, I really did it.

280
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,108
-Quiet.

281
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,052
Now, listen to your
sensei's awesome message.

282
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,154
-Yes.

283
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,691
I am ready to hear your
amazing wisdom, sir.

284
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:42,899
-This new jutsu, the lotus
technique is now forbidden.

285
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:43,600
-Huh?

286
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,169
-What do you mean?

287
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,006
Why?

288
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,945
-This jutsu, it puts a huge
strain on your body's muscles.

289
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:54,914
It's a self-sacrificing
technique.

290
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:56,116
-Huh?

291
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:59,119
-Normally, humans
only use at most 20%

292
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:00,321
of their muscles strength.

293
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:03,057
Do you understand
only about 20%?

294
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,260
If all of the power
were to be used,

295
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,863
the muscles would
disintegrate, so the brain

296
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:10,800
regulates the amount of
power the muscles can exert.

297
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,969
But this jutsu is different.

298
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:17,041
It uses chakra, which forces
the brain to go past its limits,

299
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:20,378
allowing for continuous
high-speed taijutsu.

300
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:24,550
In other words, this jutsu
relies on a secret technique

301
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,719
that brings forth power
almost to the limits

302
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:27,820
of the human body.

303
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:31,124
So you see, it's very dangerous.

304
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,997
There's one time
this jutsu should

305
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,469
be used, when a particular
condition is met.

306
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:41,004
-Yes, I see.

307
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,474
So what is the condition, sir?

308
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,576
-Are you ready?

309
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,679
You all need to
take this to heart.

310
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:54,887
The condition is--
the condition is--

311
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:03,698
LEE (VOICEOVER): Guy sensei,
I have to use the lotus now.

312
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,500
The condition has been met.

313
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,168
I must use the jutsu.

314
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,414
To protect the life
of someone precious.

315
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,950
-Did he disappear?

316
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,138
Ugh.

317
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:24,289
-Not yet.

318
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,134
-Oh no, Dosu.

319
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,739
There's no way he
can break his fall.

320
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:38,907
-Take this, [inaudible] lotus.

321
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,589
What is this feeling?

322
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,125
-Ha, got you just in time.

323
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,365
That impact could have
been much worse for you.

324
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:06,541
-What?

325
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:07,910
This cannot be.

326
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:09,879
-That is a frightening jutsu.

327
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,948
It nearly took me
out even though I

328
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,817
landed on this soft dirt.

329
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,694
Now, it's my turn.

330
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,095
LEE (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

331
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,431
My body still has not
recovered from that jutsu.

332
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:30,570
Ah!

333
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,406
-Lee, no.

334
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:44,287
-Your jutsu is indeed fast,
but ours is even faster

335
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,924
because it travels at
the speed of sound.

336
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:53,733
Effort by itself does nothing.

337
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:58,104
Now watch, we're going to show
you something called the wall.

338
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:24,403
[theme song]

339
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,310
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
I'm so sick of this.

340
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:53,746
It's like I'm always
a step or two behind.

341
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,081
And I always need
to be protected.

342
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:58,886
I want to be more like
Sasuke, Naruto, and Lee.

343
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,656
Wait, did I just say I
want to be like Naruto?

344
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,095
Well, at least he doesn't
hesitate to jump into action.

345
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:08,664
So yeah, I want
to be like Naruto.

346
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:10,266
Next time, Sakura blossoms.

347
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:18,284
In this battle, things are going
to get real serious real fast.
