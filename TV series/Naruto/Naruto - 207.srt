-Naruto.

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,495
-Kiba, you OK?

5
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:04,796
-Yeah.

6
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,298
-Was it another genjutsu attack?

7
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:12,303
-None of us, including Akamaru,
is safe from Yakumo's genjutsu.

Parasitic insects.

12
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:42,200
-Please, sensei, just
tell me the truth.

13
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,170
If you don't, I'll
have to end your life.

14
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:46,905
-It was my decision
and my decision

15
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,474
alone to seal your
genjutsu away.

16
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,209
The Third Hokage
wasn't involved.

17
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:01,486
Go ahead and release
all your resentment.

18
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:04,222
But remember, the only one
you should feel hatred toward

19
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:05,290
is me.

20
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,892
-You're just trying to
trick me, aren't you?

21
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:09,828
I heard you and the
Third Hokage talking

22
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:12,463
about how you were going
to destroy the Kurama clan.

23
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,502
-Yakumo, it's not true.

24
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,770
-Don't lie!

25
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,705
My mother and father
were too strong to let

26

themselves die in
some house fire.

27
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,151
No, someone murdered them.

No.

33
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,534
No.

00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,502

00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:52,503

43
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,171
-Oh, Kurenai Sensei.

44
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,740
You're fading away.

45
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,643
You did this to her,
didn't you Yakumo?

46
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:32,877
-Of course I did.

47
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,480
She was plotting to
eliminate my family.

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,215
This is just punishment.

49
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,549
-What are you talking about?

50
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,586
Yakumo, you must've
misunderstood or something.

51
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:47,325
Old Man Unkai told me
everything about what

52
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,527
happened between you
and Kurenai Sensei.

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,428
He told me that--

54
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:51,763
-Stop it, Naruto.

55
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,164
-No, I'm saying it.

56
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:55,366
Sure, Kurenai Sensei
sealed your powers,

57
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,903
but only 'cause she cared about
you and wanted to protect you.

58
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,571
-What are you talking about?

59
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:03,341
-You think you're the only
one who's been suffering?

60
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:05,610
Knowing your secret, not being
able to tell the truth all

61
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,280
this time, Kurenai Sensei
suffered just as much as you.

62
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:09,881
-Please, Naruto.

63
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,253
-What do you mean by the truth?

64
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:30,234
-Gai Sensei, there you are.

65
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:32,370
-Kiba, what happened
to the others?

66
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:34,872
-Shino and Hinata are
standing watch in the hallway,

67
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,842
but Yakumo's genjutsu
created another dimension,

68
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,545
and Naruto and Kurenai
Sensei are inside.

69
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:41,546
-Huh?

70
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,114
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:44,882
-I think I can explain.

72
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,618
-With your injuries,
you should take it easy.

73
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,620
-No, I must tell you
everything if you

74
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,457
have any hope of stopping her.

75
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,294
No one worried about Yakumo's
well being as much as Kurenai

76
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,228
has.

77
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,730
She tried so hard
to convince her,

78
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:02,133
pleading with Yakumo to forget
her dream and end her training.

79
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,905
UNKAI (VOICEOVER): Yakumo
was completely dispirited.

80
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,276
Obviously, Lord Murakumo was
concerned about his daughter.

81
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,446
But then one day, the
unexpected happened.

82
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,652
Their family residence
burned to the ground

83
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,621
while Yakumo stood
dazed watching

84
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:25,156
the whole thing happen.

85
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,359
That's when I first saw it.

86
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:31,329
A strange figure
appeared in the flames,

87
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:35,299
a horrible monstrous
demon smiling back at me.

88
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:42,206
But when I learned
what the beast was,

89
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:44,442
I became frozen with terror.

90
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:54,852
-The secret, what is it?

91
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:58,489
-Um, Sensei, what the
hell is going on with her?

92
00:06:58,523 --> 00:06:59,624
-This is bad.

93
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:02,427
Yakumo, just forget about it.

94
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,494
It's nothing.

95
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:04,529
Don't try and remember.

96
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,306
-Hold on.

97
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,809
I think something's
coming back to me,

98
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:19,343
deep in the back of my mind.

99
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,446
But what is it?

100
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,749
I can't remember.

101
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,551
-It's all being revealed.

102
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:30,755
Naruto, you have to stop it.

103
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:32,123
Naruto!

104
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,425
-What the heck is
this thing anyway?

105
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,893
Damn it, let go of me.

106
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:57,381
-Father, mother, all
I want is to live up

107
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:00,218
to the expectations
of our family.

108
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,820
So why does everyone
always get in my way?

109
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:05,723
I only want to master genjutsu.

110
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:08,893
Is that so wrong?

111
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:12,196
-Everyone has a path in life
that they're meant to follow.

112
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,298
Maybe your path is just
different from what

113
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:15,466
you thought.

114
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,135
-He's right.

115
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,637
Dear, there's no need to force
yourself to become a shinobi.

116
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,839
-No, don't try to cheer me up.

117
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:24,175
You try to comfort
me with kind words,

118
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,110
but I see right through it.

119
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,745
Everyone's disappointed in me.

120
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:30,748
How can I live my life with the
burden of knowing in my heart

121
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,350
that I failed my family?

122
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,859
-Yakumo, what are you doing?

123
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:43,494
-Uroko, get out of here.

124
00:08:59,377 --> 00:08:59,844
-Yakumo!

125
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,261
-I remember now.

126
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:19,564
-Yakumo.

127
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:21,499
-It was-- it was me.

128
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:25,503
The thing inside me destroyed
my mother and father that day.

129
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,340
My own hidden genjutsu
killed my parents.

130
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:31,142
-You're wrong, Yakumo.

131
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,211
That thing wasn't you.

132
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:36,881
You and that monster are
two different beings.

133
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:40,351
-I wish you were
right, but the truth

134
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:44,188
is, that thing lives
inside my heart.

135
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:53,764
Thank you, Sensei, for
everything you tried.

136
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,766
Farewell, Sensei.

137
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,436
-Don't do it!

138
00:09:58,469 --> 00:09:59,437
-No, stop!

139
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:16,220
-What?

140
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,822
The painting saved her life?

141
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,564
-We wanted to find out
what caused the tragedy,

142
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:31,435
so we ordered a complete
medical examination of Yakumo.

143
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,607
UNKAI (VOICEOVER): They
arrived at the conclusion

144
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:40,043
that the creature which
appeared at the fire

145
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,679
came from Yakumo's
deep subconscious.

146
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,316
In other words, it was a
manifestation of her id.

147
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,523
-An id monster?

148
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:57,761
-I immediately went to the Third
Hokage and asked for guidance.

149
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:01,298
Ultimately, the girl was unable
to endure the expectations

150
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:04,301
that the village placed on
her, and soon her subconscious

151
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,735
cracked under the pressure.

152
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,006
To protect itself, it
released her pent up fury.

153
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,410
Sir, we do not think Yakumo's
id monster is finished.

154
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,481
It will keep going until the
whole Kurama clan is decimated,

155
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:21,051
and then the entire
Hidden Leaf village.

156
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:23,954
-I understand the
risk, but I refuse

157
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,655
to authorize any violence.

158
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:29,459
Yakumo isn't even aware that
this evil power exists inside

159
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:32,596
of her, and this village
does not take innocent life.

160
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,565
-But Lord Hokage, once her
subconscious completely

161
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,401
awakens, there will be
nothing we can do to stop it.

162
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:41,438
-In that case, we'll just have
to work with Yakumo until she

163
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:43,974
can control the
power by herself.

164
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,909
And if that's not
possible, then we'll

165
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,411
have to seal her genjutsu.

166
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,547
-How can we?

167
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,750
-It's slightly different, but
there has been one precedent.

168
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:57,053
In a similar situation, the
spirit of the nine-tailed fox

169
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,923
was sealed away inside
the body of a newborn.

170
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:01,424
-That's absurd.

171
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,326
There isn't a ninja
alive strong enough

172
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,596
to seal the immense power
that Yakumo possesses.

173
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,633
-Actually, there
might be one person

174
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,602
I know who fits the bill.

175
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,305
However, the mission
will be brutal.

176
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,407
I pray this person
can teach the girl

177
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,442
to control what is inside her.

178
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:21,978
If we are forced
to seal her powers,

179
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,047
we will erase all
the good Yakumo could

180
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,682
have achieved in her life.

181
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,685
This person will have to
weather Yakumo's resentment

182
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:31,621
and bear the weight of ending
the lineage of the Kurama

183
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:32,589
clan's powers.

184
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:40,964
-Then the Third Hokage
lowered his head and wept.

185
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:44,034
-The one who accepted the
Hokage's mission was--

186
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,737
-That's right, Kurenai.

187
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:48,838
-Of course.

188
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,674
So that's what
Kurenai Sensei was

189
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,375
talking about this whole time.

190
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:56,379
Darn it, I had no idea she
was going through all that.

191
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,581
-[bark]

192
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:00,617
-I knew that Kurenai had
decided to seal Yakumo's powers,

193
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,820
but this is the first I've heard
about the danger the girl's

194
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,555
subconscious caused.

195
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:06,656
-Yes.

196
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,292
When the Third Hokage
died, so did the secret.

197
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,928
At this point, only
Kurenai and the Kurama clan

198
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:13,496
know the whole story.

199
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,965
-Kurenai Sensei
risked everything

200
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:18,768
to keep it a secret,
even her reputation.

201
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:19,970
-We've got to go rescue her.

202
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:21,504
-[bark]

203
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:23,473
-They're going to
need your help.

204
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:24,007
-But I--

205
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,308
-It's all right.

206
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:27,477
I can handle
everything out here.

207
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,312
-Gai Sensei.

208
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:32,048
-You're worried about Naruto
and the others, right?

209
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:34,417
So go help 'em.

210
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:34,899
-Right.

211
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,289
-That's it then.

212
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,624
It's up to them now.

213
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,431
What is it?

214
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,634
-I felt something
strange in there.

215
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,903
I don't know, but it somehow
seemed different from the way

216
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:55,805
it felt before.

217
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,774
[insects buzzing]

218
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:01,778
-My insects are acting strange.

219
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,813
-What's going on
in the other room?

220
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:04,914
Have you heard anything yet?

221
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,450
Are they OK?

222
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:08,418
-[barking]

223
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:09,552
-Oh, no.

224
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,321
I'm sensing
something new forming

225
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:14,290
on the other side, an
incredibly powerful chakra.

226
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,028
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

227
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,610
-Why, why do you
do this yourself

228
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:35,412
when you are not to blame?

229
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:36,479
-Huh?

230
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,481
-The ones who must
be crushed are

231
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:42,352
those who imposed such a heavy
burden on your psyche, those

232
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:44,487
who tried to get rid
of me just as you

233
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,890
are reaching your
full potential.

234
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:49,559
-Who are you?

235
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:54,431
-I merely crept into a fracture
in one corner of your mind,

236
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:57,701
and there I was nurtured.

237
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,336
My name is Id.

238
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,885
-So, she's finally awake.

239
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,756
-Kurenai Sensei, you
know what that thing is?

240
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,858
-Yes, it happened
soon after I was

241
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:24,794
made Yakumo's
personal instructor.

242
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:27,330
KURENAI (VOICEOVER): I was
having doubts about just how

243
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:31,701
potent her genjutsu was, so I
explored deep into her psyche.

244
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:36,039
That's when I saw it.

245
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:03,767
The sight of that
terrible figure

246
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,668
sent shivers down my spine.

247
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:07,804
I couldn't move.

248
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:11,541
You see, the Third Hokage didn't
order me to eliminate Yakumo.

249
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,845
I was to kill the
monster within her.

250
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,947
-That's what this thing is?

251
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:23,319
-This ghastly specter, it's more
powerful than it was back then.

252
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:26,556
Even so, I'd die before I
let that thing get loose

253
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,690
in our village.

254
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,925
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): She'd die?

255
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,361
Wait, so that's why
she quit squad eight.

256
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,063
This mission is more
important than anything.

257
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:37,967
-I absorb all your
pain into my body,

258
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:41,671
and now I'll settle
the score for good.

259
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,609
-No way!

260
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,278
Not on my watch.

261
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:53,550
-You're in my way.

262
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:57,520
-Naruto!

263
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,894
-I may not know what
the heck you are,

264
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:08,698
but Kiba, Shino, and Hinata are
out there waiting right now,

265
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:11,868
and I'm making sure they
get their sensei back.

266
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,304
-Naruto.

267
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:17,440
-Shadow clone jutsu!

268
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:19,709
My jutsu doesn't activate
in this dimension.

269
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:26,783
-You are a thorn in my side, so
you will be the first I erase.

270
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:28,952
-Be careful.

271
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:33,656
Yakumo, you're the only one who
has any hope of defeating it.

272
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,991
Please listen to me.

273
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,460
Every single one of
us has a fanged beast

274
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:39,729
hidden within the
depths of our mind.

275
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:43,366
It lies there waiting in the
dark reaches a person's soul,

276
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,468
and it appears at
our lowest moments.

277
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,737
It doesn't matter how
strong you think you are.

278
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,408
When the beast comes, it
is impossible to control.

279
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:56,613
You can end up hurting those
who are closest to you.

280
00:17:56,646 --> 00:18:00,049
But If the monster
can be tamed, reigned

281
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:04,287
in with the strength
of your will,

282
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:07,957
it can become a
magnificent power

283
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:12,662
and can even make
your dreams reality.

284
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:14,697
Now, you must fight it.

285
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,700
Obliterate the monster that
the depths of your own mind

286
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:18,835
created.

287
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,703
-I don't know how.

288
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:24,607
-Yakumo, you are the only
one who can finish this.

289
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:31,981
-Time to go, little boy.

290
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:34,951
[? -help beat ?] the
darkness in my mind.

291
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,286
-Now die.

292
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,700
-But why?

293
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:54,604
I did my best to serve you.

294
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:57,607
I only wanted
what's best for you.

295
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,695
-Kurenai Sensei.

296
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,364
It sure is great to
see all of you again.

297
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,971
-Kurenai Sensei.

298
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,540
-You were incredible Yakumo.

299
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:34,944
You overcame the darkness
in your own soul.

300
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:35,812
-Oh, Sensei.

301
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,516
-Don't you worry.

302
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,486
You did great.

303
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,481
Huh?

304
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:50,593
Wow.

305
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,680
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
In her heart,

306
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,751
she knew exactly who was trying
to save her the whole time.

307
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,819
She just had to realize it.

308
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:17,653
-Sensei!

309
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,723
-Kurenai Sensei.

310
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:21,958
-Hey, don't freak out.

311
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,559
Everything's fine now.

312
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:26,295
Kurenai Sensei, you
are going to go back

313
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,831
to being everyone's
teacher, aren't ya?

314
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,333
-I sure am.

315
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,835
That was my final mission
from the Third Hokage,

316
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,970
and now it's done.

317
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:34,971
-See?

318
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:35,638
-Sensei!

319
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,276
-Well that's great, isn't it?

320
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,744
Things'll go back to normal.

321
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:43,312
-Yup, looks that way.

322
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,312

325
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:04,080
-This isn't funny.

326
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:06,215
Why do we have to wear ourselves
out just 'cause of this guy?

327
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:09,052
-Yeah, we're supposed to
protect this national treasure,

328
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:10,553
but he keeps getting in our way.

329
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:11,688
-Plus he blames everyone.

330
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,222
He uses people as shields.

331
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:15,124
-He doesn't care if a
shinobi dies in a mission.

332
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:17,260
-I can't take this guy anymore.

333
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:17,827
-Me too.

334
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:18,828
If I have to I'll use--

335
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:19,629
-Rasengan.

336
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:21,230
-Fang over fang.

337
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:23,733
-We are gonna beat
up our client!

338
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:27,587
-Next time, "The Weight
of the Prized Artifact."

339
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:33,476
