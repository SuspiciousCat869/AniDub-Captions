end this battle quickly.

-You can't end it
if I end it first.

What's up with that guy's body?

That's freaky!

00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,361
I wish I could do that!

12
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:15,966
-I dislocate every one of my
joints, softening my body.

13
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,970
Then with my chakra, I
can control it perfectly.

the tighter I'll squeeze.

I don't know what you're
carrying in there,

you, it makes no difference.

I could break your neck

even fair, Kakashi-sensei?

not another ninja.

I know why.

I mean, even Sasuke collapsed.

76
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,820
And it's probably
just 'cause he's

77
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,323
so great that that's
all that happened.

Frankly, I don't
even want to imagine

what'll happen to
you if you compete.

I think it's best if
you quit, don't you?

00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:03,375
It's pointless.

That won't work on me.

-I never thought I'd fight you.

Or at least I didn't think
it would happen this soon.

Don't expect me
to go easy on you.

a stand-out among the rookie

109
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:53,810
female shinobi, so she
has a good chance to win.

110
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:56,246
But with Sakura as
her opponent, can she

111
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,683
bring herself to fight
hard enough to do it?

112

-Of all the people for
Ino to go up against,

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,655
it would have to be Sakura.

114
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:04,556
What a mess.

115

-I know.

116
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:07,594
I hope Ino will be OK.

Vo: Let's all hope.

118
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,864
So what's it going to be, Ino?

-Go, Sakura!

120
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,971
You can do it!

-Yah!

-Oh no!

125
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:37,396
I just knew it.

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,633
-Sakura's totally
blowing Ino out

-You wanna make something of it?

131
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,309
Then go ahead,
'cause you'll lose.

132

-Who do you think you are?

NEJI: That's it?

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,116
That's as good as Kunoichi can
get at hand-to-hand combat?

135
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,318
-What?

136
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,988
-It's not because they're
girls, you know, Neji.

137
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,189
-Huh?

138
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,858
-It's just that those
two are using kid gloves.

139
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:05,230
It doesn't matter if you're
a man or woman in battle.

140
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:06,631
-Huh?

141
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:09,369
Uh, using kid gloves?

142
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:26,716
-Unh!

[gasp]

147
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,209
-Kunoichi have a
special role to play.

148
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,345
They must learn not
only ninjutsu but also

149
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,215
a wide range of knowledge
and refinement as women.

150
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,852
If you can't blend
in to enemy territory

151
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,156
by adopting the customs
of the women there,

152
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,960
you'll never be able
to succeed as a spy.

153
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,696
In any event, today's
class is flower-arranging.

everyone, go into the fields

and gather distinctive flowers.

00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:36,741
SAKURA: Ino!

159
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,943
Wait up!

160
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:45,251
-Wow.

161
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:46,220
What a klutz.

162
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,370
-I'm just not very good
at this kind of stuff.

163
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:03,374
What about you?

164
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:04,309
-Hmph.

165
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:05,543
That's not good,
considering you're

166
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:06,845
named after a cherry blossom.

167
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:07,613
OK, look.

168
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:08,614
It's simple.

169
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,416
I'll explain it, all right?

170
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,686
The first thing is, find a
main flower for your bouquet.

171
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,389
Then you find other flowers
that complement the main one.

172
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:19,193
You see, flowers have to
highlight each other's beauty.

173
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:22,697
There's really nothing to it,
once you know all the tricks.

174
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,134
For example, look.

175
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,301
Uh?

176
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,239
INO: You see those cosmos
flowers over there?

177
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,776
Well, if they were the main
flowers in your arrangement,

178
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,746
then the thoroughwort
flowers you picked

179
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,581
would complement them.

180
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,050
-Oh!

181
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,252
-Cosmos flowers are also
called autumn cherry blossoms,

182
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,221
and they're the prettiest
flowers in the fall.

183
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:45,259
Their name comes from an
old word that means harmony.

184
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,494
They can harmonize with
all the other flowers,

185
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:49,930
and any autumn grass would
go just perfectly with them

186
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:51,099
in a flower arrangement.

187
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,238
-Uh-- mm.

188
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,582
-So, tell me, do I look as
pretty as the cosmos flowers

189
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:05,449
now?

190
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:09,354
Come on, am I cute?

191
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,824
-Uh, yeah.

192
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:12,858
-Sheesh!

193
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,794
Took you long enough to say it.

194
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,196
[giggles]

195
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,898
-Well, well, you
sure look like you're

196
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:20,501
having a lot of
fun, Billboard Brow.

197
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:21,102
Hah!

198
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:31,381
You know, you're still nothing
but a helpless little girl,

199
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,749
Sakura.

200
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:35,686
So don't go strutting around
like you're hot stuff, got it?

201
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,588
[cries out]

202
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:38,489
-Aah!

203
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:38,957
Aaaahh!

204
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:39,725
[thud]

205
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,760
-Fami!

206
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,329
INO: Sorry!

207
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,099
That head of yours is so empty
that I mistook it for a vase

208
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:49,503
and thought I'd better
put flowers in there.

209
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:51,739
-Ino!

210
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,875
-It's aconite, a shinobi flower.

211
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,978
I guess it really
isn't that poisonous,

212
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,947
but still, you might
want to spit those out

213
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,948
when you get a chance.

214
00:12:58,981 --> 00:12:59,915
-Uh?

215
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:03,754
[screaming]

216
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:11,396
[giggles] I forgot to say
only the root is poisonous!

217
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,401
[giggles]

218
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,804
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Ino is so great!

219
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,340
She knows practically
everything.

220
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:24,179
Her clothes are so stylish,
and she's way cute.

221
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,448
She's even good
with her shuriken.

222
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:29,151
And her ninjutsu
is awesome, too.

223
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:34,892
Compared to that, I'm nothing.

224
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,995
-Hey, what's wrong?

225
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:43,803
-Ino, if you're a cosmos flower,
then am I just a thoroughwort?

226
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,272
-Mmm.

227
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:49,275
[sigh]

228
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,379
Now why would you say that?

229
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:52,947
-Uh--

230
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,483
well, let's see.

231
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:58,320
Actually, I don't think you're
a flower at all, Sakura.

232
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:02,058
You're still a bud,
waiting to bloom.

233
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,229
--[laughs nervously]
Yeah, you're right.

234
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:25,720
-All right, listen up, Ino.

235
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:28,991
I'm not going to fight
with you over Sasuke.

236
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,593
-What did you say?

237
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,396
-I'm not the weak,
needy girl I used to be.

238
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:35,799
You're not even on my
radar, and you're not

239
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:39,103
Sasuke's type, Ino-pig!

240
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:42,040
-Sakura, you'd better
watch your step!

241
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:44,377
Do you have any idea who
you're mouthing off to?

242
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,846
Don't press your luck with
me, little Billboard Brow!

243
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,318
-Did you hear that stuff?

244
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:53,087
Sakura was so mean!

245
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,689
That's out of line, isn't it?

246
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,191
She sure made Ino mad.

247
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:57,726
I've never seen
her look so scary.

248
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,927
-Hmm.

249
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,397
Yes, but there's
more to it than that.

250
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,532
-Huh?

251
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,334
-Sakura isn't the kind
of person to do things

252
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:08,239
like needlessly flaunt her own
power, callously hurt people.

253
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,643
But she also doesn't like
having Ino take pity on her

254
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:14,146
and pull her punches.

255
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,549
-So I'm a bud that
hasn't flowered, huh?

256
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,892
Say, um, Ino?

257
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,295
-Sorry, what?

258
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,833
-Why did you give
me this ribbon?

259
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:31,967
What's it supposed to mean?

260
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:40,345
-Well, actually,
let's just say that I

261
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:42,914
thought it would be a real
big waste for you to wilt away

262
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:43,949
as nothing but a bud.

263
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,097
I mean, how said is it if
flowers don't ever bloom?

264
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,033
[wind whistling]

265
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:16,088
For all we know,
that little bud--

266
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:19,859
it might become a flower even
more beautiful than a cosmos.

267
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:21,295
[giggles]

268
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,942
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Thank you, Ino.

269
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:33,910
Thank you.

270
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,117
-Hey, come on.

271
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,821
We gotta finish our assignment.

272
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:44,188
SAKURA: Oh, OK.

273
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:45,624
INO: What's wrong, Sakura?

274
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:48,928
SAKURA: Um, I got some
dirt in my eye when I fell.

275
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,131
INO: [laughs] You're so clumsy.

276
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,566
[giggles]

277
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:59,074
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Ino, all along,

278
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:02,811
I've tried to live my life by
what you said to me so long

279
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,113
ago.

280
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,783
I thought that if I tried
hard enough, I could do it,

281
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:09,619
that I could become a
beautiful flower instead

282
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,657
of a bud always waiting
but never blooming.

283
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,426
So I set my sights
on you, because I

284
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,230
wanted to be like
you from the start.

285
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,366
You set an example
for me that gave me

286
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,535
a goal to strive toward.

287
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,141
And it's because of that that
I made it as far as I did.

288
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,611
It's why I'm here today.

289
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:33,649
But now I don't want
you to hold back.

290
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,058
It's time I surpassed you.

291
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:45,597
But if I don't face your very
best, then there's no point.

292
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,833
-What-- what in the
world is going on?

293
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:15,967
-What do you mean?

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,170
-Why are those two
getting so worked up just

295
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:20,005
looking at each other?

296
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,241
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

297
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,243
He just can't see
that he's exactly

298
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:27,448
the same way when
it comes to Sasuke.

299
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,952
-Well, Naruto, rivalry
is a tricky business.

300
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,187
Not that I would know.

301
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:35,924
-Hm?

302
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,194
-[laughs] Oh, hi there.

303
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,596
MIGHT GUY (VOICEOVER): Ugh.

304
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:42,566
What else would I expect
from my old rival Kakashi?

305
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,002
Yet another glib,
senseless statement.

306
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:47,873
Man, it burns me up
when he acts so cool!

307
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,814
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Guess what?

308
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,950
I got put on the
same team as Sasuke.

309
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:59,220
-So why are you
telling me this now?

310
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,592
-I won't lose to you.

311
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,494
Not anymore, Ino.

312
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,196
-Sounds like a good idea to me.

313
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,166
And no matter what happens,
I won't lose to you either,

314
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,867
Sakura.

315
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,888
OK?

316
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,411
INO (VOICEOVER): The ribbon!

317
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:20,779
SAKURA: I'm giving this back.

318
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:30,825
-Hmph.

319
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:31,626
That's a gift.

320
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:32,828
It's to hold your hair back.

321
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,530
I mean, that headband's
really supposed

322
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:37,499
to go on your forehead, right?

323
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,636
-From here on, I'm
no longer someone

324
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,973
who's going to chase
after you, Ino.

325
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:45,576
When this goes on
my forehead, then

326
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:50,883
that's when I'll become--
I'll be a true shinobi.

327
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,787
[wind whistling]

328
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,298
INO: That's a good plan.

329
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,979
Me too.

330
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:15,613
-Until then.

331
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,686
-Heh.

332
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,690
I understand, Sakura.

333
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,917
SAKURA AND INO (VOICEOVER):
This time, we do this right.

334
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,321
No holding back.

335
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:52,425
A fair fight.

336
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,561
And I'm going to win!

337
00:20:55,594 --> 00:20:58,132
-Rrraahhh!

338
00:20:58,165 --> 00:20:58,732
-Rrraahhh!

339
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:02,503
-Aah!

340
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:03,471
-Whoa!

341
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,672
[gasp]

342
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:21,793
[music - rythem, "harmonia"]

343
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,936
INO (VOICEOVER): When did
Sakura get this strong?

344
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,905
This'll be harder
than I thought.

345
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,908
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): As
I expected, Ino's great.

346
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,076
But I won't lose.

347
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,945
I absolutely will not lose!

348
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,513
INO (VOICEOVER): I
can't believe it!

349
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,848
We're evenly matched now!

350
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,650
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I'm
not who I used to be.

351
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,919
I'm better, stronger!

352
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,521
SAKURA AND INO
(VOICEOVER): The next blow

353
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:08,290
will decide this battle!

354
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:11,569
INO (VOICEOVER): Next time,
the Ultimate Battle Tchah!

355
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:17,169
I won't lose this battle, even
if it's the last thing I do.
