rules for this match

are the same as in
the preliminaries.

The match continues until one
of you dies, or admits defeat.

However, I can stop the match,
but that's solely my decision.

-Hello, Guy.

13
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:47,770
How are you feeling, Lee?

14
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:50,542
Are you all right?

Sorry about that.

19
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,629
You must have been worried.

20
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,966
Sorry for not keeping in touch.

Eight members of the ANBU Black
Ops in an arena this size.

That's nowhere near enough.

What could Lord
Hokage be thinking?

43
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,934
-Well, not knowing how
the enemy's going to act,

44
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:56,406
the ANBU Black Ops have probably
been disbursed and stationed

45
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,011
around the key parts
of the village.

We can't afford to
let our guard down,

49
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,362
but for now, at least, we
need to watch this match.

This is going to be awesome.

-Kakashi, I'm going to be
carefully watching your pupil

to see if your
training was any good.

have to act so cool?

Don't get so mad at me.

is he talking about?

00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:30,824
-Early, early-- I know, I made
you taste such awful blood.

73
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:33,762
I am so sorry.

74
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:41,644
But this time, I'm sure that
it'll taste so very good.

00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:44,582
-His conversation
has started already.

00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:47,287
This is dangerous.

-I Know.

78
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,825
This is the first
time I've seen Gaara

79
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,662
get like that before fighting.

80
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:55,603
That's how powerful
an opponent Sasuke is.

81
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:56,104
Watch.

remember yesterday?

I'll kill you all.

-That's what he said,
but then he didn't do it.

It was the perfect
opportunity, buddy.

I don't know.

It was like he didn't
even see us or something.

-We're not good enough,
not for that guy.

103
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:30,344
-Right now, the only person that
can make him feel anything--

104
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:31,346
-The only one is Sasuke.

105
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,355
-And I live solely for myself.

106
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,825
I love only myself.

107
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:42,266
And there's no end to it
as long as there are still

108

[music playing]

123

-Incredible, he's almost as
fast as Lee's normal speed.

124

-Hey, thanks for all
your help, ANBU guy.

130
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:09,670
So, it looks like Hinata's going
to make a full recovery if she

131
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,608
can just get some rest.

Come on, there's
no way you could.

He's an ANBU Black Op.

same as Lee's, with his weights

removed.

161
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,318
-That's exactly
like Lee's taijutsu.

00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:24,291
Sasuke has way more speed
than he ever did before.

00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,249
Really remarkable.

166
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:40,255
You are truly a
genius, a greater ninja

167
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,758
than I ever imagined.

168
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,130
I mean, how many years did it
take me to attain that speed?

169
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,736
And you achieved the same
result in just a month.

[heavy breathing]

172
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:03,430
-But it sure looks like it
takes a lot of stamina for him

173
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,933
to maintain that speed.

174
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,343
-What's Gaara going to do now?

175
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,917
That sand armor uses
up too much chakra.

176
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,922
It won't last for
very much longer.

177
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:19,760
-Mhm, mhm.

178
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:26,640
[music playing]

179
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:29,078
-His training--
what did you two do?

180
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,513
-Hm?

181
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:34,621
-To get to such a
level, in a mere month.

182
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,728
-Sasuke has copied Lee's
taijutsu with his Sharingan.

183
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:42,101
So, during the taijutsu
training I did with Sasuke,

184
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,875
I simply had him imagine
Lee's movement and copy it.

185
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:54,357
Sasuke mastered that taijutsu
only because he knew Lee.

186
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,695
Of course, Sasuke
had to work very hard

187
00:15:56,728 --> 00:16:00,535
to master it, even
with his Sharingan.

188
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:04,510
-But that sand ninja, he
is way too tough for that.

189
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,880
He cannot be taken down
with only that taijutsu.

190
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:15,129
-If Kakashi saw the battle
between Gaara and Lee,

191
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,299
then why did he--

192
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,705
[wind blowing]

193
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:23,144
[gunshots]

194
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:27,685
-After all, that taijutsu
Sasuke learned from Lee

195
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:29,889
can't suddenly work against
an opponent that even Lee

196
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,227
himself couldn't defeat.

197
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:35,132
But Kakashi must
have known this,

198
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,837
so why did he have Sasuke
master only taijutsu?

199
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:51,930
-Uh.

200
00:16:51,963 --> 00:17:01,881
[wind blowing]

201
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,637
-What then, was left for
me in this existence?

202
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,005
Why go on living?

203
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,382
But in order to live,
you need a purpose.

204
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:24,590
To exist for no reason is
the same as being dead.

205
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,761
-What is this guy talking about?

206
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,940
-Then, in time, the
answer came to me.

207
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,344
To put it simply,
my reason for living

208
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:38,248
is in the killing of others.

209
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,619
For years, I lived
in fear of those

210
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:42,055
who were sent to murder me.

211
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:46,363
But now, I am at peace.

212
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:46,964
[clears throat]

213
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,867
-Huh?

214
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:55,113
-Shikamaru, we have to go talk
to Kakashi Sensei, right now.

215
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:57,784
-What are you planning to do?

216
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,523
Hey, wait.

217
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:01,791
-I've got to stop him.

218
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,729
I've gotta stop the match.

219
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:10,642
-Gaara couldn't possibly be
planning to use that jutsu.

220
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:20,726
[music playing]

221
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:58,195
-So, he's used all
the sand as a shield.

222
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,401
Because of the sand's
density, I didn't

223
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:03,138
think it could create
something this hard.

224
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,417
So, he's absolutely protected.

225
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:15,361
[music playing]

226
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:19,668
-The sand-- he's
covered his entire body.

227
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,707
-What an effective
and vexing defense.

228
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,811
Will Sasuke be able
to get around it?

229
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,553
NARUTO: Kakashi Sensei!

00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,022

00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,024
-Oh.

232
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:33,494
-Hm?

233
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,729
-Narutro.

-Wha-- what is it Naruto?

236
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:44,815
-Sensei, please.

237
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:47,820
You just have to stop
this match, right away.

238
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,655
-What?

239
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,924
-Oh.

240
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,362
-The guy Sasuke is
fighting is completely

241
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,065
different than the rest of us.

242
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:57,203
He's about as far from
normal as you can get.

243
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,407
-Naruto, slow down.

244
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,946
What are you trying to say?

245
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,852
-He thinks his point in
life is to kill people.

246
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:06,120
Don't you see?

247
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:09,626
If this continues,
Sasuke will die.

it's that jutsu.

This is bad.

254
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,977
Gaara isn't even thinking
about our plan at all.

255
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,914
-Uh.

-Sasuke, once I fought
you, and I arrogantly said,

262
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,760
it is no use if your eyes
see me if your body is

263
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:21,363
too slow to do
anything about it.

But, now you've nearly the
same super speed as I do.

also have your Sharingan.
