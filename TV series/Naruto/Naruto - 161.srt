challenging mission, Lee.

00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,801
Are you ready?

00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,268
-Yes, sensei!

6
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,334
I am always ready.

-The subjects are moving out.

13
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,234
And from the size of those
big packs they're carrying,

14
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,568
they ought to be gone for
awhile, overnight, at least.

we'd be lucky enough

to get the perfect
opportunity right off the bat.

waiting for you?

00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,568
-Of course it worked.

35
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,668
I mean, why do you think
we spent all those months

36
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,768
perfecting our Disguise Jutsu?

37

This mission will
make us legends!

Not to mention the honor
it'll bring our village.

us more missions!

They've got a thing in this
village called a hokage.

He's like their chief,
and wherever we find him,

00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,834
that's where we'll find
their secret documents.

-Right!

67
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,534
Got it.

68
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:18,268
-This guy's a big
shot, so just look

69
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,134
for the biggest
building in the village.

-Eh?

00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:21,601
-Huh?

72
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:26,968
-Wait, there!

73
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,068
That's gotta be it!

00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,901
-Something going on
at the hokage's place?

-Dah!

76
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,701
-What's up?

77
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:34,634
-Nothing!

78
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:35,601
Nothing-- Nothing
at all, really.

We-- we-- we're
just standing here!

documents or anything!

-And I'm Lee.

-Hmm.

94
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,434
You two don't look
like yourselves.

95
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,268
Are you feeling all right?

96
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,301
-Yeah, fine.

Never better.

-There's something
different about you.

99

I can't quite put
my finger on it.

100
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:04,968
-Ahh!

101
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,168
Look there!

102
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:08,001
A flying monkey, eating
an egg roll with his feet!

103

104
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,034
Where?

00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,668
[zooming off]

106
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:18,334
-Hey, are you guys pulling my
leg, or-- Hmm, that's funny.

107
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,601
[labored breathing]

108
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,968
-Ooh, that was close!

109
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,801
That nosy ninja
snuck right up on us!

110
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,434
-Yeah, but don't worry.

111
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:29,334
We fooled that sucker.

112
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:30,401
-You bet we did.

113
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,034
Our Disguise Jutsu
could fool anyone.

114
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,468
-Yeah.

115
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,734
-Woo hoo hoo!

116
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,601
This is gonna be even
easier than we thought!

117
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:38,668
-Yeah!

118
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,268
Who said the Leaf
Village was so tough?

119
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,101
[laughing]

120
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,034
-Gai and Lee impostors,
here in the village?

121
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:48,468
-Real ninja would have
used transformation jutsu

122
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:49,901
to disguise themselves.

123
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,134
Who are these guys?

124
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,101
They sound pathetic.

125
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:53,368
[oinking]

126
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:54,968
-The village must be doing well.

127
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,568
The wackos are moving in.

128
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:59,268
-Not that I think these
clowns pose much of a threat,

129
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,934
but I thought it was
worth reporting anyway.

130
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,401
-No matter how
harmless they seem,

131
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,401
we can't have intruders
running around freely.

132
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,801
Should we run them out of town?

133
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,601
-Not yet.

134
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,734
Hold off a while.

135
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,168
-Huh?

136
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,834
-Who knows, it might be amusing.

137
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,634
We'll think of them as
a sort of a training

138
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,001
exercise for the
people of the village.

139
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,901
-But, are you sure?

140
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,968
-I wouldn't worry
much about that.

141
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,901
I can't imagine anyone
being dumb enough

142
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,134
to actually fall
for these imposters.

143
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,234
[chuckles]

144
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:28,501
-Come on, Gai-sensei.

145
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:29,234
I'm beggin' ya.

146
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,401
Just this once!

147
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,234
Please, Bushy Brow?

148
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,368
Please?

149
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:34,934
Let me train with you
once, just for today?

150
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,401
Please, please,
please, please, please!

151
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,234
Oh, come on.

152
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:39,801
I won't get in your way, really!

153
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,734
-Hey!

154
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,768
What're we gonna
do about this guy?

155
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,834
-He obviously knows
them pretty well.

156
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,601
-Yeah, but he wants
to train with us.

157
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,601
We don't know any training!

158
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:50,368
-Huh?

159
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,734
-Come on!

160
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,568
You know I've been dyin' to
learn that taijutsu of yours!

161
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,301
I'll do anything!

162
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,034
Anything at all!

163
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:55,868
Name it!

164
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,134
Come on, please!

165
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,068
-We've gotta lose this kid.

166
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:00,934
-Sorry.

167
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,634
The answer is no.

168
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:03,134
-Heh?

169
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:04,268
Why not?

170
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,134
-Well, our training is

And of course ultra,

-Ultra, ultra top secret?

That's so cool!

-Why'd you say yes?

Where do you think you're going?

-Huh?

211
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,334
-We're supposed to be
helping that farmer today!

-Farmer?

213

-Don't tell me you forgot!

214
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,134
We promised we'd help him.

Come on, he's waiting.

-We promised to plant all
these rice paddies for you?

We must have been
out of our minds!

-Whoa.

224

That's a lotta rice.

Wait a second!

Yeah, that's it!

234
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:53,068
Back-breaking labor combined
with incredible boredom!

235
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,868
It's some kind of
endurance training!

236

Hey, I love it!

237

Don't worry.

quite right about that kid.

-Ugh.

241
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,834
This is not how I pictured
Elite Operation Infiltration.

-Ah, shaddup.

up and finish this.

an eye out for 'em.

Whoa, you're right!

297
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,368
It's a lot harder to carry
when you dodge and weave.

-Well, you see.

These guys are teaching
me all their ultra

letting me train with them!

before you're burnt to a crisp?

509
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,950
-Oh, shut up, you little squirt!

510
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,683
It's all part of the training.

511
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:28,583
We're just, uh,
working on our reflexes

512
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:30,216
and keeping calm under fire!

513
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,950
-Ah!

514
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:31,916
I should have known!

515
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,416
Everything's part
of their training,

516
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,016
even something like this!

517
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,683
Look at Bushy Brow!

518
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,083
Even with his butt on
fire, he's still training!

519
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:40,883
And I thought I was tough.

520
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,216
[slap]

521
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,616
-Now I get it!

522
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,083
All right, Gai-sensei!

523
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:48,050
Don't worry, I'm on
guard, I'm with ya!

524
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,483
OK, hit me with your best snot!

525
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,950
-Oh dear!

526
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,383
I have such an
aching in my joints,

527
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,416
and a splitting headache.

528
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,816
-What the-- What do
you mean, joints?

529
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,516
Slugs don't have joints!

530
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,016
-Ahhh!

531
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,083
-Hey, hey, watch
where you're going!

532
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:11,583
[thud]

533
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:12,083
-Ahhh!

534
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,850
-This village is hell.

535
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:19,350
We're in hell.

536
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:23,550
I don't think I'll survive
another minute in this place.

537
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,716
Ugh.

538
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,250
-I say we quit.

539
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:27,250
-Yeah, fine.

540
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:27,750
Nngh.

541
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:31,816
-Huh?

542
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:37,050
-Explain yourself!

543
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,250
Who are you?

544
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:41,050
-And why are you dressed
like my protege, Rock Lee?

545
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,983
-OK, that does it!

546
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,583
I'm sick of this game!

547
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,550
-Ahhh!

548
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:51,216
Super Mega Extra Hyper Attack!

549
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,683
-I have no idea
what this is, but I

550
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:54,150
think we are under attack!

551
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,083
-So it would appear.

552
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:56,816
Are ya ready, Lee?

553
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,116
-Our new technique?

554
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,416
BOTH: Double Dynamic Entry!

555
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,350
[thud]

556
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:04,616
-I've forgotten.

557
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,883
Why did we ever do this in
the first place, I wonder?

558
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,650
-If I never see the
Leaf Village again--

559
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:12,350
BOTH: It'll be too soon!

560
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,816
[ting]

561
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,683
-Look, fireworks!

562
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,383
-I don't know where they came
from or what they were after,

563
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,716
but I doubt we'll see
them again anytime soon.

564
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,416
-You certainly seemed
to be enjoying yourself.

565
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,950
You even summoned Katsuyu.

566
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:29,650
-Hmm.

567
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,583
Well, it wasn't just me.

568
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:34,850
It was a team effort, wasn't it?

569
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,883
-Well, now that all the
fun and games are over,

570
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,583
you should really be
getting back to work.

571
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:41,016
-[sighing] Yes, ma'am.

572
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,116
-I wonder.

573
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,616
Do you think Naruto
really fell for them?

574
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,483
-Naw, no one could be that dumb.

575
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,316
Not even him.

576
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,883
-What was all about?

577
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,216
Very peculiar!

578
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,850
-Very!

579
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,183
-Hey!

580
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:53,016
-Naruto!

581
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,450
Did you see those two imposters?

582
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:55,350
-There you are!

583
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:57,116
So you're both all right?

584
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,183
I thought I lost you!

585
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,183
-Hmm?

586
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,250
Gai-sensei, I
gotta admit, I used

587
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,916
to think you were
kind of a lightweight,

588
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,716
but now I take it all back!

589
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,183
-The way you always push
yourselves to the limit

590
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,316
and never let up?

591
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,950
I think I'm ready for
that kind of commitment.

592
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,050
I want to continue my training!

593
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,916
-What training is that?

594
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,350
-Yeah, good one!

595
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,916
So when do we get to the
taijutsu and all that?

596
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,316
-Uhhh.

597
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,850
-Huh?

598
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:21,283
CROW: Moron!

599
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,816
Moron Moron!

NARUTO: Ghost hunting?

603
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,257
That's no job for a ninja!

604
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,723
Besides, ghosts
don't even exist!

605
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,457
SAKURA: Stop complaining!

606
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,490
A mission is a mission!

607
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,990
NARUTO: The ghost of
some dead warlord!

608
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:12,590
Yeah, right!

609
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:13,890
Gimme a break.

610
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,057
SAKURA: They say he appears
in the dead of night,

611
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,623
wearing his gleaming
white armor!

612
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,023
NARUTO: Ooh, scary!

613
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:20,957
That's so stupid!

00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:22,557
Behind you!

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,823
NARUTO: What, where?

617
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:24,790
SAKURA: Ha ha!

618
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,790
So it's stupid, huh?

00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,623
