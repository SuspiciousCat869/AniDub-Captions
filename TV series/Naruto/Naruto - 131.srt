SASUKE (VOICEOVER): No matter
what darkness may await me,

3
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,098
I will meet it head on.

4
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:42,931
And whatever happens,
I will get that power.

5
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:55,631
It's getting pretty late.

6
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:25,465
What was that?

7
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,231
I could've sworn there
was someone there.

00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,098
The lights.

Wha-- What is going on?

12
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,698
What is happening?

13
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,131
Uncle.

Oh no.

Father and mother are
both-- I don't understand.

Who could do all this?

30
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:52,765
Wait a sec.

00:05:52,798 --> 00:06:03,498
What are you--
What have you done?

32
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,198
Big brother!

-Stop it!

38
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:34,665
Itachi, why are you
showing me all this?

39
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:39,565
Why-- why did you
do this, brother?

00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:08,898
Why?

44
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,031
Why did you do this?

45
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,165
Itachi, why?

46
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:20,498
-To test the limits
of my ability.

47
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:25,465
-To test your ability?

48
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,365
That's why you did this?

49
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:34,265
You're telling me that was
why you butchered them?

50
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:41,865
-It is of great importance.

51
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:45,131
-What are you saying?

52
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,131
[shout] You're out of your mind!

53
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,498
I'm scared.

00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,965
I'm scared!

Please,
I don't wanna die!

57
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,602
It's a lie.

58
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,802
This isn't like
you, big brother.

59
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:07,802
It can't be.

60
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,302
-I have acted like
the older brother

61
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,669
you desired for one reason.

62
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:16,535
Because I wanted to discover
how powerful you were.

63
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,569
I needed to find
a worthy opponent

64
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:22,235
to test the limits
of my own abilities.

65
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,402
You have that unique potential.

66
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,602
Now I've made you hate me.

67
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,369
Now you have the
desire to defeat me--

68
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:35,135
which is exactly what I'm
going to allow you to live.

69
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:37,169
Don't you see?

70
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,602
It's all for my own benefit.

71
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:42,102
Like me, you may
be one of the few

72
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,402
who can use Mangekyo Sharingan.

73
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:49,202
But there is a catch.

74
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:58,369
Take the life of
your best friend.

75
00:09:58,402 --> 00:09:59,369
You must kill him.

76
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,802
-That's a lie.

77
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,702
-Kill him.

78
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,669
Just like I did.

79
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:18,769
-Do you know anything
about Shisui Uchiha

80
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:22,235
ending his life in Nakano River?

81
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,802
-Shisui was the other guy who
never turned up at the assembly

82
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,102
yesterday.

83
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,335
It's funny.

84
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:29,369
If I remember correctly,
you kind of looked up to him

85
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:32,102
like an older
brother, didn't you?

86
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:35,402
-You're saying that was you?

87
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:39,635
Itachi, you killed Shisui?

88
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,535
-I did.

89
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,035
How else do you think I
obtained these powers?

90
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:49,802
In the main hall
of Nakano Shrine,

91
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:53,169
underneath the seventh
tatami mat from the far right

92
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:57,102
is the clan's secret
gathering place.

93
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,602
There you will find
a secret document.

94
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:04,035
An explanation of the
Uchiha clan's jutsu.

95
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,702
It tells of the visual
jutsu's true purpose.

96
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:08,769
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What?

97
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,035
The true purpose?

98
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,902
-If you discover
how to activate it,

99
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,302
you will be the third person
to obtain the Mangekyo

100
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:22,235
Sharingan, including myself.

101
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:27,869
To ensure that happens, that's
enough reason to let you live.

102
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:32,002
Well, that's all.

103
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,369
Oh, don't worry.

104
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,569
You're not worth killing.

105
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,902
My foolish little brother.

106
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:42,569
If you wish to kill me one
day, in hate and revenge,

107
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,935
surviving such an unsightly
manner as this, by all means,

108
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,435
flee.

109
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:52,869
Cling to your wretched
life, and then, one day,

110
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:57,202
when you possess the same
eyes, come back and face me.

111
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,035
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): A dream?

112
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:35,202
Yeah.

113
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,835
That's what I heard, too.

114
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:40,169
That boy was the only one
who survived the massacre.

115
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:42,469
-Someone said they think
he has an older brother.

116
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:44,735
Is that right?

117
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,502
-Yeah, he does, but no one
knows where he is right now.

118
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,635
-Oh.

119
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,635
-I can't believe it, that the
elite Uchiha clan could just

120
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:55,102
be--

121
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,869
-Hello there, Sasuke.

122
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,169
What tasty treats can
I get for you today?

123
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,102
WOMAN: Good morning, Sasuke.

124
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,635
Heading off to
school now, are you?

125
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:07,135
-Ah huh.

126
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:11,969
-I saw your brother earlier.

127
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:14,069
He's grown into such a man.

128
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:17,202
He's an excellent
shinobi, isn't he?

129
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:20,235
Graduating the Academy
the age of seven,

130
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,502
and first in his class.

131
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,569
And he was a Chunin
at 10, wasn't he?

132
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:24,835
-Yeah.

133
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,969
And he could use Sharingan
by the time he was eight.

134
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,135
-That's right.

135
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,635
How could I forget?

136
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,602
That boy is the pride
of the Uchiha clan.

137
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:34,669
No doubt about it.

138
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,102
-Sasuke, dear.

139
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:15,702
Welcome home.

140
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:48,035
Sasuke?

141
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:50,035
Hold on a minute.

142
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,869
-What is it?

143
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:04,435
-Mom?

144
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:07,369
[meowing]

145
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,969
SASUKE: He's only thought
of Itachi before now!

146
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:24,735
-Your older brother's your
older brother, and you're you.

147
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,835
But your father has always cared
very deeply about both of you.

148
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:22,002
ITACHI (VOICEOVER): In the
main hall of Nakano Shrine,

149
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:25,369
underneath the seventh
tatami mat on the far right,

150
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:27,502
is the clan's secret
gathering place.

151
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,369
-I see now.

152
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,235
So that's what it all means.

153
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:48,502
-What do you say, Want to go to
the candy store after school?

154
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:49,135
-Huh?

155
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,602
No way.

156
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:53,802
You can get away with that
stuff 'cause your mom's nice.

157
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,669
But if my mother found out
I didn't come straight home,

158
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:00,402
man, I'd be in some
serious trouble.

159
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:01,602
-Did you hear?

160
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:05,269
Apparently the entire
Uchiha clan was murdered.

161
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:06,202
-Yeah.

162
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:08,469
That's what my dad
was telling me.

163
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:11,302
-They say that Sasuke's
the only one who survived.

164
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,369
-Now then, that's my boy.

165
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,202
-When we're alone
and no one's around,

166
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,469
the only one he
talks about is you.

167
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:46,302
-I wish I knew what kinds of
things he said to her about me.

168
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,902
ITACHI (VOICEOVER):
If you wish to kill me

169
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:01,469
one day in hate and revenge--

170
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:05,469
-Brother.

171
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,969
No matter what
darkness may await me,

172
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:15,435
if it means killing you,
I will meet it head on.

173
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:19,369
And whatever happens,
I will get that power.

174
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:22,869
From this point on,
I am an avenger.

175
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:30,802
NEJI (VOICEOVER): Wherever he
is, Sasuke is in the darkness.

176
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,002
If we all stay
put here, we won't

177
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,302
be able to catch up with him.

178
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,135
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Neji.

179
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,602
It's just like you said.

180
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:03,435
Sasuke is in the depths
of darkness right now.

181
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,802
He really wants to kill me.

182
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,302
I can't believe it.

183
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,302
What am I to you now?

184
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,869
We were comrades.

185
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:19,369
Or have you just
forgotten all about that?

186
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:21,869
Are you telling me that all
the things we did together

187
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:27,802
in Squad 7 mean absolutely
nothing to you now?

188
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,802
-No.

189
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:35,235
(VOICEOVER) And whatever
happens, I will get that power.

190
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,535
They weren't meaningless.

191
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,669
One thing was worthwhile.

192
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,935
Our friendship.

193
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:45,202
We became best friends.

194
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,002
-We became best friends?

195
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:50,135
Then why are fighting?

196
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,169
-I just told you.

197
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:56,569
Because we're friends,
there's far more

198
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,502
meaning in destroying you.

199
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:06,269
-I can't understand that.

200
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:11,269
But what I know is that for some
reason, you want to destroy me.

201
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,035
Right, Sasuke?

202
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,983

203
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:06,392
NARUTO: Sasuke, are you trying
to take me down for real?

204
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:09,125
What you told me
before, I don't know

205
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:11,625
whether you really
meant it or not.

206
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,258
Maybe it was just a lie.

207
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,225
Maybe I'm the only one who
thought we were friends.

208
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:21,325
If that's the case-- well, I
guess I'm completely pathetic!

209
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,025
Aren't I, Sasuke?

210
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:29,125
Next time, For A Friend.

211
