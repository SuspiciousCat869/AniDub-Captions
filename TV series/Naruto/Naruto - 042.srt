00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:47,423
-All right, listen up Ino.

3
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,731
I'm not going to fight
with you over Sasuke.

4
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,601
-Sakura, you'd better
watch your step.

5
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:58,372
You have any idea who
you're mouthing off to?

6
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,376
Don't press your luck with
me little billboard brow.

7
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,577
-Did you hear stuff?

8
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,346
Sakura was so mean.

9
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,715
That's out of line, isn't it?

10
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:06,849
She sure made Ino mad.

11
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,019
I've never seen
her look so scary.

12
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,554
-Hm, yes.

13
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,357
But there's more
to it than that.

14
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,693
-Huh?

15
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,295
-Sakura isn't the kind
of person to do things

16
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:19,901
like needlessly flaunt her own
power, callously hurt people.

17
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,838
But she also doesn't like
having Ino take pity on her

18
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:23,940
and pull her punches.

19

SAKURA AND INO (VOICEOVER):
This time we do this right.

20
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:48,774
No holding back.

21
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:51,411
A fair fight.

22
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,282

a plain old jutsu?

-This isn't just some Ninja
Academy graduation exam.

27
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,187
Do you really think
you can beat me

28
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,057
with a basic ninja
art like that?

29
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,659
INO (VOICEOVER):
If I look carefully

30
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,063
I can find out which
is the real one.

31
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:31,233
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): I've
sent chakra to my feet

32
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,635
for a burst of speed.

33
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:33,603
And then--

34
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,205
-What?

You play with fire and
you're going to get burned.

39
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,223
Let's see your best Ino.

40
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:54,097
-It's not like I needed
your invitation, you know.

41
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:57,369
I'll give you my best, but
you're not going to like it.

42
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,716
-You're doing awesome
Sakura, awesome!

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,052
Believe it!

44
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,121
-Powerful strikes using chakra.

45
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,524
Top notch considering
she's a rookie.

46
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:14,659
-Huh?

47
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:17,229
-I've never seen
Sakura this good.

48
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:18,365
-Hold on.

49
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,267
You're not saying
she's better than me?

50
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,968
-No.

51
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:21,635
You're that's greatest.

52
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,842
Sending chakra all
throughout her body

53
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:30,014
and using it in conjunction
with a well timed jutsu?

54
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:33,185
I don't even think that Sasuke
could have done it better.

55
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,755
Well, even from the
start of her training

56
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,726
she was extremely good
at chakra control.

57
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,863
So this isn't a surprise.

58
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:42,864
ROCK (VOICEOVER): Yeah!

59
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,835

62
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,121
Sakura is, Ino is just as good.

63
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,257
This battle will rage
for quite a while.

INO (VOICEOVER): Man.

66
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:14,175
Since when did she
get this strong?

67
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,345
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
(STRUGGLING) I can do this.

68
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:17,947
I know I can.

69
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,549
SAKURA AND INO:
You little-- Argh!

70
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,859
[grunts]

71
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,829
-Whoa

72
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:34,603
-At this rate this
battle will never end.

73
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:37,206
-This has been going on so long.

74
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,741
They've been at
it for 10 minutes.

75
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,226
-This isn't how this
was supposed to go.

76
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,763
How can you be evenly
matched with me?

77
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,099
-I guess you're right Ino.

78
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:57,768
You're obsession with
your looks and your hair

79
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,270
can't be surpassed.

80
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:01,773
I've been training too hard
to worry about that stuff.

81
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,080
-You're going to pay for that.

82
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:09,751
I've had enough of
you making fun of me.

83
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,186
-What an idiot.

84
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,989
Ino's falling for her trap.

85
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:15,025
She's so riled up
by Sakura there's

86
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,561
no telling what she'll do.

87
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:17,595
-Oh man.

88
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:19,031
I hate it when she's like this.

89
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,923
-Huh.

90
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:40,293
You think that'll help?

91
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:44,566
-Uh-oh I think she's
totally lost it this time.

92
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,968
-That's it!

93
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:49,539
[growling] See.

94
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,141
I don't need this.

95
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:58,418
NARUTO: And I thought
she looked scary before.

96
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,352
-All right.

97
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,289
I'll put an end
to this right now.

98
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:05,428
Get ready to tell everyone that
you lost to me Billboard Brow.

99
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:06,663
-Wait.

100
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:08,099
Don't tell me she's going to--

101
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:11,603
-Could it be?

102
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:12,605
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Uh.

103
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:13,406
Oh.

104
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,208
If I recall, that sign is--

105
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:17,044
-I knew I recognized it.

106
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,647
It's the Mind
Transfer jutsu sign.

107
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,882
-Oh man.

108
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,483
That fool.

109
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,123
-Look, I know you're frustrated.

110
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,593
But that's pointless.

111
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:29,895
-Oh yeah?

112
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,931
We'll just see about that!

113
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:34,901
-Ninja art Mind Transfer jutsu.

114
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,604
It's a jutsu that
allows the user

115
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:38,574
to take over their
opponent's spirit

116
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,010
and wrest control of
their body away from them

117
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,013
for a few minutes
by discharging all

118
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,083
of their own spiritual
energy and striking

119
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,718
their enemy with it.

120
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:49,689
But despite its power,
there are major flaws

121
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:53,694
to this formidable jutsu that
makes it extremely dangerous.

122
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,598
First, the user's
discharged spiritual energy

123
00:07:56,631 --> 00:08:00,504
can only fly straight, and it
moves at a very slow speed.

124
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:04,009
Second, even if the spiritual
energy misses the enemy

125
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:07,714
it can't return to the user's
own body for several minutes.

126
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:11,719
And this, in battles that are
most often measured in seconds.

127
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:14,523
I should add that while the
spiritual energy is gone,

128
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:18,428
the user's body, your body
Ino, can't move at all.

129
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:21,099
It'll be little
more than a doll.

130
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,370
-The Mind Transfer jutsu
is only used for spying.

131
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,372
It's not a battle jutsu.

132
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:30,312
Ino, using that jutsu here
wouldn't just be a bad idea,

133
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,815
it would be a fatal mistake.

134
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:34,484
-It's a powerful jutsu.

135
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:38,189
But as long as Sakura can dodge
it, it's not really a threat.

136
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:40,993
Plus, if she can avoid
it, she can attack Ino

137
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:42,729
without any resistance.

138
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,165
If that happens,
Hayate will be forced

139
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,068
to bring the match to an end.

140
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,036
-So what?

141
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,971
I don't care.

142
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,842
I won't know unless I try.

143
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,145
-If you miss, it's all over.

144
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:57,515
You do know that, right?

145
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,718
-She's only supposed
to use this with me,

146
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,855
so I can immobilize
the enemy first

147
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,724
with my Shadow Possession jutsu.

148
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:06,962
If she uses it this
way it'll never work.

149
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,698
-There's no way
she'll hit Sakura.

150
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,041
-Huh?

151
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:17,377
-Don't do it!

152
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,683
-Nina art Mind Transfer jutsu!

153
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,285
[dart sound]

154
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,568
-Did it work?

155
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,979
-Ha, ha, ha.

156
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:50,355
What an unfortunate choice Ino.

157
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:51,624
-So it's all over right?

158
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,896
-I can't believe she did it.

159
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,332
-You're done Ino.

160
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:03,774
No way!

161
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:11,551
-You fell for it Sakura.

162
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,252
Ha!

163
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:15,323
I finally caught you.

164
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,292
-It can't be.

165
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,261
-Ha, ha, ha.

166
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:20,630
I'm afraid it can.

167
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:24,235
All those hand signs earlier
were just an act to fool you,

168
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:27,974
to trick you into running right
into the trap I laid for you.

169
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,709
And It worked.

170
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,080
Now you can't move
at all can you?

171
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:35,384
You're being held by a special
rope that's made from my hair

172
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,653
with my chakra poured into it.

173
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,560
Now that you're trapped
I can take over your body

174
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:46,165
and make you say that you're
giving up on this match.

175
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,405
-There's no way I'll ever
miss with this jutsu now.

176
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,941
-Now I see.

177
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,276
-That little fool.

178
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,714
So losing it was
just an act too.

179
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,549
-You gotta get out
of there quick!

180
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:02,021
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
[grunting] I can't move.

181
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:05,091
-Now, Mind Transfer jutsu!

182
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,459
-Ha, ha, ha.

183
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:32,930
That's really unfortunate.

184
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:34,131
-Ino missed.

185
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,535
-Hm, no wait.

186
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,004
-Sakura has been--

187
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,005
-Nice one Sakura.

188
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:42,877
-Not quite.

189
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:04,388
NARUTO: I don't get it.

190
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:07,692
What's with Ino,
and with Sakura?

191
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:11,063
I mean, Sakura's acting really
strange, don't you think?

192
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,100
This is her chance.

193
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,635
Do it already Sakura!

194
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,936
Attack!

195
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,670
-Ha.

196
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:18,273
It's futile.

197
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:20,976
-The Mind Transfer jutsu worked.

198
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,813
Sakura's done for.

199
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:24,181
-Huh?

200
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:25,517
The Mind Transfer?

201
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,654
Does that mean that--
that Sakura has?

202
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:29,756
-Yes.

203
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,325
I'm afraid so.

204
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:35,764
Sakura's spirit has been
completely taken over by Ino.

205
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,399
-What?

206
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:42,206
-Ino's spirit is
inside of Sakura now.

207
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,378
I'm guessing that Ino's
goal is probably--

208
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:49,215
INO (VOICEOVER): And
just like that it's over.

209
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,753
Now then Sakura, if
you'd be so kind.

210
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:10,011
-Now, I, Sakura Haruno, would
like to say that I with--

211
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:11,613
NARUTO: No!

212
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,983
Sakura don't!

213
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:17,689
-Gah, man, that kid's
just so annoying.

214
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,958
-You worked so hard
to get here Sakura!

215
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:25,032
Don't disgrace yourself now by
losing to that lame Ino girl!

216
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:26,166
-Yell all you want.

217
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,338
There's nothing you can do now.

218
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:29,771
-Uh.

219
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,108
Huh?

220
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,076
What?

221
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,050
[grumbling] Ah!

222
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,218
What's happening?

223
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,560
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
Naruto's so annoying!

224
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,301
Yeah, he's right.

225
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,272
I can't let Ino beat me.

226
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:57,243
-Oh, Sakura.

227
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,811
This can't be happening.

228
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,052
-What's wrong are
you withdrawing?

229
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,589
Well, are you or not?

230
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:09,092
[screams]

231
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,895
-No, I won't be withdrawing.

232
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:12,865
Not today or any other day.

233
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:13,799
[punch]

234
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:14,533
-Ya!

235
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,737
You're mine!

236
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,075
-Which one is it?

237
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,042
-What in the world?

238
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,678
How can this be?

239
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,180
-Sakura.

240
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:26,183
INO (VOICEOVER): No way.

241
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:29,187
Ah!

242
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,991
But my jutsu is unbeatable.

243
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:36,197
-Ino, you're going to be in way
bigger trouble than you've ever

244
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,167
seen if you don't get
out of me right now!

245
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,769
INO (VOICEOVER): Ah!

246
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:42,338
-What's up with Ino?

247
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,041
Something looks wrong.

248
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:48,980
INO (VOICEOVER):
[struggling] No!

249
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:53,554
I can't hold on to her!

250
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:54,305
-Release!

251
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,784
-It can't be.

252
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:16,853
She did it.

253
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,889
She shattered Ino's jutsu.

254
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:21,092
-She must have used
up too much chakra

255
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,027
before attempting the jutsu.

256
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:25,731
So she didn't have enough
chakra to do it right.

257
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:32,608
-How can you have
two spirits in you?

258
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,610
Just what are you anyway?

259
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,520
-Someone who's just as
strong as she is beautiful.

260
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:43,623
I mean, a girl's got
to be tough if she's

261
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:46,259
going to survive
something like this.

262
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,429
-Once you're caught
in that jutsu

263
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:52,202
it's certainly not easy
to cast out the invader.

264
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:54,705
Ino's lack of
chakra contributed.

265
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:55,672
That's for sure.

266
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,642
But even more
important than that

267
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,813
were Sakura's defiant heart
and her combative attitude

268
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,048
towards Ino.

269
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:05,386
It also seems Naruto had
something to do with this.

270
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,623
His voice awakened
Sakura's spirit

271
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:10,159
allowing her to casting Ino out.

272
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:13,531
Just like I've seen in Naruto,
Sakura's fighting spirit

273
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:15,367
is stronger than the others.

274
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,670
So she can overcome
obstacles that otherwise

275
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:19,405
would be beyond her abilities.

276
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:20,807
[grunting]

277
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,911
-But now both of them
are almost out of chakra.

278
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:27,150
This battle will come
down to brute force.

279
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,158
SAKURA AND INO:
This ends right now!

280
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,926
-Since neither combatant is able
to continue, by double knockout

281
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,130
no one gets through the fourth
battle of this preliminary.

282
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:51,632
This match is over.

283
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,267
NARUTO: What?

284
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,134
Sakura!

285
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:53,902
ALL: This can't be.

286
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:54,741
NARUTO: No way!

287
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:58,976
-Very well then.

288
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:02,014
-Good grief.

289
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,048
-Hey, Ino!

290
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,384
-Sakura, no!

291
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,319
-Sakura, wake up!

292
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,890
Are you OK?

293
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:09,550
-Shh.

294
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,742
-I don't think that
treatment will be necessary.

295
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:25,379
They'll probably just wake
up after a little while.

296
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:33,857
But they both certainly
put up a great fight.

297
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,927
-Yeah.

298
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,032
Despite her success
with Naruto and Sasuke

299
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:42,236
I didn't think Sakura had
what it takes to win here,

300
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,906
but she's grown a lot.

301
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,109
She may not have done as
well as she would have liked,

302
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:51,615
but still, a lot of
good happened here.

303
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:53,652
I really feel that it
was the right choice

304
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:55,420
to send her to
these Chunin exams.

305
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:08,939
-I'm so ready.

306
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:13,212
After watching that last
match, I'm fired up.

307
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:17,117
-So this is another genin
from the Sand Village.

308
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,118
-Go Tenten!

309
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,921
-This should be
interesting to watch.

310
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,163
[moaning]

311
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,239
-So you're finally
waking up, huh Sakura?

312
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,009
[gasp]

313
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,544
-Come on Tenten!

314
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,113
Use the power of youth!

315
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:40,282
-Nice Lee, let's
hear that support.

316
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,250
You can do it Tenten!

317
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:42,886
-Take her down Tenten.

318
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,424
INO: Our match is already over.

319
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:50,029
[gasp]

320
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:53,500
-So did I-- did I lose then?

321
00:19:57,373 --> 00:19:58,374
-That's no fair.

322
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,277
I'm the one who wants to cry.

323
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,511
To think I tied with you.

324
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,113
I still can't believe
that happened.

325
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:07,153
Here.

326
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:15,397
Guess you finally got a flower
to bloom, a beautiful flower.

327
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:24,410
-Ino.

328
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,279
[giggles]

329
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:35,993
-But Sakura, the
next time we fight,

330
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,631
you don't get to take the
easy way out by fainting.

331
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:43,536
And don't forget, I won't
just hand over Sasuke to you.

332
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,540
Understand Sakura?

333
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:47,942
-Oh yeah?

334
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,045
Well, that goes double
for you Ino, you ugly pig!

335
00:20:55,152 --> 00:21:01,194
-For the fifth match,
Tenten, Temari, get ready.

336
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:22,958

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Anyone who says

338
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:54,550
that women are weaker
than men obviously

339
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:55,952
hasn't seen them fight.

340
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:59,256
As for me, I think that
these women are way scary.

341
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,193
And what can I say
about you Shikamaru?

342
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,761
Well, a lot actually.

343
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:06,466
You're a boring, lazy, average,
ordinary, good-for-nothing.

344
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,004
If you don't start putting
your whole heart into things

345
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:11,373
this exam will be over
real soon for you.

346
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:15,366
Next time, Killer Kunoichi
and a Shaky Shikamaru.

347
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,500
It just doesn't get much
more exciting than this!
