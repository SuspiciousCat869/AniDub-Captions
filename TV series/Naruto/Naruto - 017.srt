by killing me?

You're still holding back.

If that is all the strength
you can put into it,

you will never keep your vow.

There is only one person
who matters to me,

and I live to protect
and serve him.

That is my purpose--
to show mercy

to those who oppose
the one you serve--

78
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:23,456
to allow his enemies to live
when you could strike them

79

down-- this is not compassion.

80
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:30,598
It is a betrayal of your
life's very purpose.

81
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:33,502
For what reason
do you exist then?

00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,638
You're of use to no one.

83
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,207
Your life has no meaning.

after day of pain and struggle--

no longer of any use to Zabuza.

-There were once others who
mattered to me long ago.

My father and my mother.

98
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:25,067
I was born in the Land of
Water in a small village where

99
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,169
the snow lies deep
in the winter.

100
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,673
My parents were
farmers and very poor.

101
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,376
Our life was hard,
but we were content.

102
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,250
My parents were good to
each other and kind to me.

103
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:41,587
Yes, we were happy once.

104
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,156
But then everything changed.

105
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,765
Because of something that
happened long before I

106
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:53,302
was even born,
everything changed.

107

00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:55,405

109
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,240
What happened?

110
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,442
-It wasn't my doing.

111
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,383
It is in the blood.

112
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:04,984
-Blood?

113
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:08,989
So what was it?

114
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:13,628
You said something happened
that changed everything!

115
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:16,699
-It was my father who changed.

116
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,168
He killed my mother,
and he almost killed me.

[gasping]

118
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:23,941
After years of suffering
the horrors of civil war,

119
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,477
the people of my land
had come to fear and hate

120
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:30,349
anyone who carried the
Kekkei Genkai in their blood.

121
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:32,218
NARUTO: Kekkei Genkai?

122
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,921
HAKU: The advanced
bloodline trait of a clan.

123
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:38,659
It's jutsu and abilities
passed down from generation

124
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,061
to generation.

125
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:42,130
Because of their
unique abilities,

126
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,233
the clans were used
as mercenaries.

127
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:47,203
They fought in many battles
and were much feared.

128
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:49,940
But when the war was
over, they were despised

129
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:53,010
and shunned by the people who
feared their presence would

130
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:55,280
only bring more
war and misfortune.

131
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:02,289
So it was that after
the wars, these clans

132
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:05,526
went into hiding-- denying
the bloodline trait that

133
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,396
flowed in their
veins, concealing

134
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:11,868
their unique abilities--
knowing that to be discovered

135
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,703
meant certain death.

136
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:16,173
If you had searched
that boy's memories,

137
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:19,010
I'm sure you would have
found it there, too.

138
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,846
The cruelty of people--
their fear of things

139
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,982
they don't understand.

140
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:27,854
For years, my mother
was successful in hiding

141
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,790
her bloodline trait.

142
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:32,660
She met and fell in love
with a simple farmer.

143
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,062
And they were married.

144
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,664
And after that,
my mother thought

145
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,800
she would lead a
peaceful, ordinary life

146
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,502
to the end of her days.

00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,415
knew our secret-- my
mother's and mine.

176
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:24,467
HAKU: When at last I was myself
again, I was no longer myself.

177
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,271
My father and mother
were gone, but I

178
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,006
knew that something
else had been

179
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,011
taken from me-- something
even more important.

180
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,580
And that is when
I truly despaired.

181
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:40,220
-More important than
your mother and father?

182
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:41,522
What?

183
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,090
-My purpose.

184
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:46,161
In all the world, there
was no one who needed me.

185
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:48,230
I was unnecessary.

186
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:51,902
-(VOICEOVER) Just like me!

187
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:55,473
-Why is it you're so
determined to be Hokage?

188
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,176
Because you want all eyes in
your village to look on you

189
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,046
and recognize you
as a great ninja.

190
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,982
You see, it is only
through the eyes of others

191
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,652
that our little lives
have any significance.

192
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,355
When there is no one who sees
you or will even look at you,

193
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,194
it's as if you do not exist.

194
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,996
Then Zabuza came along
and looked at me,

195
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,100
and his eyes were not
full of hate or fear.

196
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:19,837
He did not shun me
for my strangeness.

197
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,308
Indeed, my special powers
were just what he wanted.

198
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:27,079
He made me necessary again.

199
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:28,480
ZABUZA: Huh.

200
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:32,185
Little kid like you with
no one to look after you--

201
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,155
you'll die a beggar's death.

202
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,862
-Hey, you know what?

203
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,364
Your eyes remind me of mine.

204
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,343
ZABUZA: Well, little one,
will you stay here and die?

205
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:54,613
Or come with me
and be of some use?

206
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:58,819
Will you serve me and submit
to my will in all things?

207
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,194
[music playing]

208
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:15,339
Then your special abilities
belong to me from this day

209
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:17,709
forward.

211
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:31,660
Let us go then.

212
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,938
-I was happy.

213
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:44,142
ZABUZA: My time
here is done, Haku.

214
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,714
Tonight, I cast aside
the Land of Water.

215
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:51,284
One day I will return
and seize this land

216
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,154
and hold it in my hands.

217
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,225
Many things must be done
before that day comes,

218
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,827
and you will help me to do them.

219
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,365
But I warn you-- friendship,
comfort, encouragement--

220
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:06,303
I do not need these things, nor
should you expect them from me.

221
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,105
-I understand.

222
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,707
I am yours, Zabuza.

223
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,345
I am only an instrument
of your will.

224
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,714
Think of me as a weapon
to be kept at your side

225
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:19,086
and used as you see fit.

226
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,656
-Well said, child.

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,194
-I have failed you, Zabuza.

229
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,797
I am like a weapon that
has been broken and is

230
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,266

ZABUZA: I don't
know why you bother.

237
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:11,852
Of what use is your jutsu
if you can't even find me?

238
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,688
But I can find you.

You disappoint me, Kakashi.

I think you're right.

That was a summoning jutsu.

I was calling forth
my ninja hounds.

They can track a scent anywhere.

When you attacked me, I
let you get past my guard.

I wanted you to cut me.

You see, it's the smell
of my blood on your blade

00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,199
that led them to you.

Looks like I wasn't the
only one who was blind.

Ah.

The mist is finally clearing.

00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:31,452
And you know what I see?

Talk.

Do you mean to talk me to death?

KAKASHI: In a way, yes.

275

Right now, my hounds are
just playing with you.

276
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:46,704
But one word from me, and
they'll tear you apart.

277
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,441
Poor Zabuza.

00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,810
See where your
ambitions got you?

You were always
pushing things too far.

[crashing]

281
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,694
It was the failed
Mizukage assassination

282
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:07,097
and your attempted coup d'etat.

283
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,634
You were forced to flee with
the few followers you had--

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,138
your country's tracker
ninja hot on your heels.

You became a rogue ninja whose
name was quickly known even

in the village
hidden in the leaves.

Now, you're crazy enough to want
to go back and try it again.

288
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,320
But for that, you need money.

289
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,690
And to get it,
you stooped so low

290
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:32,562
as to be the hired thug
of a swine like Gato.

All right, Zabuza, enough talk.

Time to finish it.

And you don't care.

That is not the

Why should they matter to me?

00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,474
-Well, yeah.

332
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:30,076
A little.

333
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:35,616
When he found me, I was without
a purpose or reason for living.

334
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,719
Zabuza gave me both.

335
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:41,558

336
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:43,761
[laughing]

337
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:48,767
[gasping]

338
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,895
-But now, my usefulness is over.

339
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:15,300
The only thing that gave my
life meaning-- it's gone.

340
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,739
I am a broken tool-- a blunted
weapon of no use to anyone.

341
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,112
Go on, Naruto, do it.

342
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:30,886
For both of our sakes,
do it-- quickly.

343

344
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,209
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Look.

345
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:11,212
It's not as if I like
Haku-- not after what

346
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:16,285
he did to Sasuke, but to
kill him in cold blood?

347
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:17,419
What do I do?

348
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,923
What would a Hokage do?

349
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,892
If only I could have
had a straight-up fight

350
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:24,662
like Kakashi-Sensei and Zabuza.

351
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,398
I mean, hey, I'm just a kid.

352
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:29,001
How come I always have to
make the tough decisions?

353
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,404
What would the other guys do?

354
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:35,887
Next time-- The Weapons
Known as Shinobi.
