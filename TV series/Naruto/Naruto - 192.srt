is for the daughter

of an affluent feudal lord
who's looking for a body double.

I don't know where
she heard about you,

but it turns out you're
her spitting image.

She was pretty adamant,
said she wouldn't

Is this princess being
targeted by someone or what?

-I think it's more
accurate to say

12
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,829
she's the one doing
the targeting.

-OK.

A girl always wants to look
good for the man she yearns for.

-Even if she's a fake?

my magic on this guy,

That must be pretty convenient.

-But I would give anything
just to meet him in person.

him in the whole wide world!

Now, look, just make sure
that he falls for me, OK?

mission's a mission, right?

All I can do is hold
my nose and plunge in.

like the sun!

-Worship at the foot of the
glorious Prince Chikara!

It appears I kept you

-Do you always scatter flower

-Flowers are a blessing.

So relaxing for
the mind and body.

This guy's not really living

He seems a bit like Choji.

would be handsome!

Just look at him!

He's a stuck up,

Of course it's Chikara.

Don't be silly.

I wish that I could
see him in person

do to seal the deal, OK?

Now, quit your complaining

Well, how about a little

-Wonderful.

I'm rather taken
with them myself.

They speak the language love.

the meaning vary

depending on the
color of the blossom?

you or anything,

You're a professional

been all that congenial so far.

00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:13,807
-Hey!

328
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,708
Wait a sec!

[stuttering]

00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:18,580
-P-- P-- P-- Princess Fortune?

[moaning]

332
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,489
-I'm sorry, Prince
Chikara, but do you

333
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:27,427
think you could help
loosen this sash for me?

334
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,830
-Uh, well, I, uh--

335
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,366
[moaning]

336
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,967
-With sugar on top?

00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,436
INO (IN BACKGROUND): Oh my gosh!

338
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,573
The ceiling is
swarming with bugs!

339
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:36,909
They're gigantic!

340
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,578
-What?

341
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,512
[screaming]

-Swarming with bugs?

345
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,522
Do you see anything?

346
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,957
-Man, I hate bugs.

347
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,559
Whoa!

348
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:48,793
What the?

349
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,563
-(WHISPERING) What the heck
do you think you're doing

350
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,665
in there?

351
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,432
CHIKARA: Huh?

352
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,000
Where's the princess?

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,901
WOMAN: I don't know!

354
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,704
She vanished!

355
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,274
-What's going on around here?

356
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,710
This is getting really annoying.

357
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,745
Ugh!

358
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,915
I need to see what's
happening in there.

359
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:04,751
-What did you have
to go butting in for?

360
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:07,322
I had him in the
palm of my hand!

361
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,724
-You little idiot!

362
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,961
Why on earth are you dressed
like Princess Fortune?

363
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:12,330
-Look!

364
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:13,999
I've skimmed through enough
of pervy sage's novels

365
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,502
to know this is the kind of
thing that works on guys, OK?

366
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,841
-I can't believe you would stoop
to such a disgusting level!

367
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:21,310
[groaning]

368
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,511
Pervert!

369
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,716
No one would ever mistake
you for a comic book hero,

370
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:25,750
you filthy little toad!

371
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,353
-(NARUTO'S VOICE)
Say what you like,

372
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:30,291
but I was making a lot more
progress than you wer--

373
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,294
[groaning]

374
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:35,531
-Anything more
you'd like to say?

375
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:37,836
(VOICEOVER) I'd better wrap
this up before anyone else

-(NARUTO'S VOICE) That Prince
ain't seen nothing yet.

379
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,615
If we expect to bring
this mission home,

380
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,385
then she's going to
need my help in there!

381
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:50,721
[yelling]

382
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:54,327
CHIKARA: Oh, Princess,
where did you run off to?

383
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,862
[giggling]

384
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,330
-Please forgive me.

385
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,866
I've been so nervous
meeting you today,

386
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,504
I guess I flew off
in a bit of a panic.

387
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,740
-You really seemed like a
different person for a moment

388
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:03,708
there.

389
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:04,877
-I'm so sorry.

390
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,848
But you're such a striking
man, Prince Chikara.

391
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:10,819
It's almost overwhelming
being this close to you.

392
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:11,888
-No!

393
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:13,624
I can't have you
feeling this way.

394
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:16,027
What say we change
the atmosphere?

395
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:19,266
-Uh, in that case,
uh, let me, uh--

396
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,036

there, Chikara, honey!

CHIKARA: (NERVOUSLY)
Outside the door!

401
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,689
-Yes, love, is something wrong?

402
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,592
-Out that door just now!

403
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,495
I just saw a whole
other princess!

be, you silly boy?

(ANGRILY) Naruto!

407
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:46,373
It's very flattering, though.

408
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:49,812
You feel so deeply, you conjure
visions of me at every turn.

409
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:50,780
CHIKARA: Visions?

410
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,915
(NERVOUSLY) No.

411
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,918
I'm telling you!

412
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,521
-Look no further.

413
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,491
Uh--

-(VOICEOVER) Aw, nuts,
I wasn't thinking.

417
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,539
You have to forgive
me, my prince.

418
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,342
I couldn't bear the
thought of your eyes

419
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,911
on anything else but me.

420
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,816
-All this passion is
blowing me away, darling.

421
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,611
All right then, your wish
is my command, little lady.

and I'm aiming to fan the flame.

PRINCESS: (SCREAMING)
What are you doing?

435
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,590
You can't kiss him!

I don't want you kissing
that man, you got it?

00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,937
-That's the last thing I want.

441
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:51,440
Honestly, you couldn't
have come at a better time.

442
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,976
-Look, I don't want to hear it.

443
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,413
The most you're allowed to
do in there is hand holding,

444
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:56,615
do you read me?

445
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,416
-Quiet!

446
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,618
Stop making such a racket.

into thin air again.

-I think I can handle that.

Anyway, we can't keep
standing around out here.

If he sees us together,
then we're busted.

Now, hurry, Princess,
back to your room.
