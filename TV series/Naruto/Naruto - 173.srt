ya? [grunts] Ah!

to rethink this.

-Hmm, I'm not sure--
a bunch of spirits

trapped at the core of a
water elemental, probably.

111

That's what I'm
thinking, anyway.

-Well, cutting it's
not gonna work.

116

It'll just revive itself
with all this sea water.

117
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:18,925
-Yeah, so what other options
does that leave us then?

118
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,564
-The trick is gonna be getting
to those spirits at its core.

119
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,568
We have to damage them, somehow.

-Damage them?

121
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,939
Well, how do we pull that off?

00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:28,210
-Our opponent is
a clump of water.

123

If we heat things up around
here, maybe he'll evaporate.

-Heh, they haven't got half a
brain between the 2 of them.

while they can!

00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:07,255
I hope you know some
fire-style jutsu!

135
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,291
-Fire?

136
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,230
That's not exactly
my specialty, Chief!

137
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,232
-Here we go!

138

-Aah!

What do I do?

Aah!

141
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,117
-All right, here goes nothing!

142
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,636
-How did they--?

143

-Oh!

144
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:35,011
-Boy, look at that!

145
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:36,948
-Nicely done.

00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,286
-No!

148
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:40,890
It can't be!

149
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,894
-We got 'em, Chief!

150
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,900
-Heh, walk in the park.

151
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,770
-That's right, big guy,
you put us together

152
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,707
and we're unstoppable!

153
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,313
I hate to rain on
your parade, but I

154
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,051
think you might be
forgetting something.

155
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,953
-Huh?

156
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,189
I don't follow ya.

157
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,327
-You brought me down right
in the middle of the ocean,

158
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,663
you dum-dum!

159
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:03,802
Look at this-- my
skin's a catastrophe!

160

-Please!

161
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:06,942
These warts have been here
as long as I've known ya!

162

-Keep pushing me, kid!

163
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,649
You're on thin
enough ice as it is!

164
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,384
Don't make it worse!

165
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,186
-Huh?

166
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,188
N-n-now, wait a second.

167
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:14,791
Let's just talk about this!

168
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,761
-I'm done talking!

169
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,432
-Aah!

170
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:19,115
Aah!

171
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,777
-Yuck!

172
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,782
Everything itches!

173
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,153
You deserve a lot worse,
but I'll let you off

174
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,358
with a slap on the
wrist this time,

175
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,428
for all the trouble my
boys have caused you.

176
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,734
-Aah!

177
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,871
-See ya later!

178
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,009
[grunts]

179
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,879
-It won't happen again, Chief.

180
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:43,750
They'll think that
you burned me alive.

181
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:44,232
Huh?

182
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:54,705
[seagulls]

183
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:02,754
-Well, we dealt with your
sea monster, now you.

184
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,959
You'll be taken to the
Village Hidden in the Leaves

185
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,898
and tried for all the crimes
you've committed out here.

186
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:09,201
-That's right!

187
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:12,140
Not to mention the trip to
the moon I got from the Chief!

188
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,409
-Humph!

189
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:15,246
What's wrong with you, Isaribi?

190
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,983
Take care of these fools now!

191
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,394
-I'm done with you!

192
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:23,930
-Are you forgetting?

193
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:27,104
I'm the only person who can
give you back your humanity.

194
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,272
-I don't care!

195
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,276
If I keep this up, I'll
be nothing but a monster,

196
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,312
at heart!

197
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,249
-Hey, I knew you'd
finally come around!

198
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:35,053
Well said.

199
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:40,263
--[laughing] You're
neither a human being,

200
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:43,069
nor fully integrated like I am!

201
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:45,808
[laughs] The best
you can hope for is

202
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:49,783
to wander this earth as a freak!

203
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:52,120
The truth of it is, I never
wasted a moment's thought

204
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:56,128
as to how I would
reverse your condition.

205
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:59,469
Like I said before,
the only reason I

206
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,773
kept you around
was to dissect you.

207
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,977
-It can't be.

208
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,948
-You rotten piece of garbage!

209
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,286
How much lower can you get?

210
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,823
Huh?

211
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,560
-That's enough.

212
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,196
Once we get him
back to the village,

213
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,935
he'll be held accountable
for everything he's done.

214
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:24,119
[laughing]

215
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:29,062
-Now, I think it's
about time you told me.

216
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:32,000
Orochimaru-- where
do I find him?

217
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,512
-Do you really think
I know where he is?

218
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,353
The man tossed you aside.

219
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,257
(MOCKINGLY) And yet, you
still search for him.

220
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,066
-You and I are nothing alike!

221
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,404
With my research
on this island, I

222
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,008
would've eventually
surpassed him.

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,853
-Oh, really?

224
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,825
-Aah!

225
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:01,827
[groans]

226
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,461
-Hey!

227
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,098
How come you got to sock him?

228
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,203
-All righty, then,
mission complete.

229
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,471
Let's get going, shall we?

230
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:08,473
-That ain't fair!

231
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,277
I wanna get one in!

232
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:13,016
-Give it a rest.

233
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,185
-Your luck, pal!

234
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:29,015
-This is the place
Amachi was talking

235
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,954
about-- chair Alignment.

236
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,958
This is where my
nightmare began.

237
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:41,907
There may be fragments
of my memory left here.

238
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:45,315
[birds chirping]

239
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:27,633
-Ugh!

240
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:36,117
[gasping]

241
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,529
-Nyorai Hashimoto,
what have you done?

242
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,497
This pain is--

243
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:05,109
[evil laugh]

244
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:12,089
-[groans] [gasping] Ah!

245
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,492
Ah!

246
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,465
[screams]

247
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:20,039
[organ playing]

248
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,441
-She's still alive.

249
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,443
LORD AKAHOSHI: Mm.

250
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:42,149
[chuckles] She's a lucky girl.

251
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:46,626
So out of the 10 we tested, she
was the only one to survive.

252
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:52,169
One last delicious harvest,
before my departure.

253
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,573
-Departure?

254
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,612
LORD AKAHOSHI: There's no reason
for me to be here, anymore.

255
00:16:56,646 --> 00:17:00,186
But my lord-- the research.

256
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,190
It's all yours.

257
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,098
You can consider
it a parting gift.

258
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:09,471
As of this point, I've
no further need of it.

259
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,415
-But why?

260
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:16,786
How could you do this?

261
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,189
I don't get it!

262
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:20,760
I've looked up to you more
than anyone in the world!

263
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,313
-You simply didn't
measure up, my dear.

264
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:34,088
I'm afraid you lack
the hunger for power,

265
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:38,396
the drive, the hatred.

266
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:39,833
Everything and anything.

267
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,755
Although, you didn't die.

268
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:56,767
To make it this far, you
can't be totally useless.

269
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:57,769
Well?

270
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,773
How about it?

271
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:02,311
Care to accompany me then?

272
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,351
[heart beating]

273
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,574
-Fair enough.

274
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:36,781
Somewhere, out there, is
the diamond in the rough

275
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,183
that I'm looking for.

[gasps]

00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,719
-It's all coming back.

00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,342
-It's so bright!

279
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,621
I wasn't cast aside.

280
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:18,198
It was my choice,
and mine alone.

281
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:27,516
-Hey, you guys!

282
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,854
How come Haku is
missing in action?

283
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,824
-There was no sign of
her when I woke up--

284
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:34,730
just a note saying that
she'd be back in a bit.

285
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:35,832
-What's her deal?

286
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,204
Can't she sit still
for like, one second?

287
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,308
-There's the pot calling
the kettle black.

288
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:41,812
-What's that supposed to mean?

289
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,414
-You got a beef with me?

290
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,387
[growling]

291
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,757
-Are you sure?

292
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:49,360
I can really come with you?

293
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,330
I mean--

294
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,934
-Well, of course, you can!

295
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,470
And don't worry.

296
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,507
She's a little scary, but we've
got a top-notch medical ninja

297
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:57,744
back in the Hidden Leaf!

298
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:58,779
-Right.

299
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,852
Lady Tsunade is actually
a medical specialist.

300
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:02,820
-Yeah!

301
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:04,724
The whole kage is
simply amazing!

302
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:06,662
I just know she'll
be able to help.

303
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:07,664
You can relax, now.

304
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,903
You'll be in good hands with us.

305
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,876
-Thank you, all.

306
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:14,744
-Hey!

307
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:15,980
Come on!

308
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:16,882
-Huh?

309
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,352
-What's the hold-up?

310
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,788
The boat's about to shove off.

311
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,491
-Wha-- when did she--?

312
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,961
-What's the matter with you?

313
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:26,335
We've just been standing
around waiting for ya!

314
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,403
-Oh, sorry about that.

315
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:30,717
-Whoa!

316
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:31,174
Whoa!

317
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:31,645
Whoa!

318
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:32,280
We're coming!

319
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:32,814
We're coming!

320
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:43,836
-All right!

321
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,308
We're headed back to the
Hidden Leaf Village again!

322
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:49,280
-Seriously, you've been
spinning like a top from start

323
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,284
to finish on this journey.

324
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,022
Don't you know the
meaning of the word tired?

325
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,426
-OK, what's that
supposed to mean?

326
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:57,263
-It's a compliment.

327
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,833
You really came through.

328
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,536
-Wait, for real?

329
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:03,542
Go on-- you're embarrassing me.

330
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:09,487
[giggling]

331
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:09,963
-Right.

332
