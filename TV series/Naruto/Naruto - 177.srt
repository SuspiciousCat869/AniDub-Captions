[theme music]

2
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,178
-Aw, man.

3
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,249
I'm exhausted.

4
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,289
Some big important solo mission.

5
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:00,393
Breaking my back,
rebuilding their fortress.

6
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:02,832
It's grunt work,
not shinobi work.

7
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,510
Ow.

8
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:14,558
I'm about to fall apart if I
don't get some serious R&amp;R. Ah,

9
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:16,863
a hot spring, great!

10
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:19,803
I can't wait to soak my bones.

11
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:23,243
Listen to me, I sound
like an old man.

12
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,549
What the heck was that?

13
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,538
Shadow clone jutsu.

14
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:49,433
Wah.

15
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:56,449
-Thank you very much.

16
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,294
-Pardon me, but who are you?

17
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:05,601
-I am a delivery ninja.

18
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:06,971
NARUTO: Please, Mr. Postman.

19
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:15,523
-24, 25, 26.

20
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,360
They're all accounted for.

21
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:19,431
Thanks to you, Naruto,
my delivery record

22
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,801
will remain spotless.

23
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,903
-I'm glad.

24
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:25,277
But what are deliver
ninja, anyway?

25
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:27,616
-A special service entrusted
with the most important

26
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:28,885
documents and parcels.

27
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,890
We risk our lives to
deliver them safely.

28
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,527
-So you're like a mailman?

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,831
-No, there's a big difference.

30
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:37,771
Mailmen don't have to risk
their lives, but we do.

31
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:38,740
-I get it.

32
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:40,310
You're a mailman
that risks his life.

33
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,381
-Oh, never mind.

34
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,486
Anyway, I have a
schedule to keep

35
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,922
and many things to deliver.

36
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:49,630
I must be on my way.

37
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,833
Hey, wait, what's your name?

38
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:51,434
-596-03.

39
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,011
-That sounds more
like a zip code.

40
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,934
Any place will do as long
as it has a hot bath.

41
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:08,872
SHOPKEEPER (VOICEOVER):
We have lovely lounge.

42
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:09,940
-Maybe not that one.

43
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,845
It sounds a little crazy.

44
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,451
Wait a minute, that voice.

45
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,824
-I bet you say that to
every girl you meet.

46
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,862
-Only the pretty ones.

47
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:20,798
-Ah!

48
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,535
Pervy Sage!

49
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,439
-Who the devil's calling me?

50
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,922
-Well, Pervy Sage, you
want to explain yourself.

51
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,394
You're supposed to be away
from the village on some kind

52
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:37,066
of important mission,
and meanwhile, I'm

53
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,305
just sitting there waiting
for you to get back.

54
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,476
Well, if you've got this
much free time on your hands,

55
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,513
we can start my
training right now.

56
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,451
-Hold on a second, Naruto.

57
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,687
There's a reason I'm here.

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,722
-Save it.

59
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,426
You'll just come up
with some phony story.

60
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,529
-It's not like that.

61
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,867
-It's research for my book.

62
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,644
You see, I've almost finished
writing the very last volume

63
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:58,813
of "Makeout Violence."

64
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:01,018
-That's your big
important mission?

65
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:04,959
-No, but I am on a mission
and it is important.

66
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,696
And that's why I'm here.

67
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,906
-OK, what's this mission about?

68
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,411
-Well, believe it
or not, my sources

69
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:15,883
tell me that someone from
the Akatsuki organization

70
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,754
will arrive in this
town sometime the day

71
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:18,757
after tomorrow.

72
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,359
-The Akatsuki?

73
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,030
Do you think it could be Itachi?

74
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:25,037
-I have no idea,
nor do I have a clue

75
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,740
what would bring them here.

76
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:29,780
And I won't find out until
the day after tomorrow,

77
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,651
so instead of just
sitting around,

78
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:33,522
I thought I'd use the
time productively.

79
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:34,022
-Exactly.

80
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:35,593
What a great idea.

81
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,831
We could squeeze in
two days of training.

82
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,033
-Uh, yeah.

83
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,672
Actually, that's not
really what I had in mind.

84
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,842
You see, it's this book.

85
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,579
I promised my publisher
I'd get it off

86
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,752
to them today or tomorrow, and
they're breathing down my neck.

87
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:48,888
-Oh, come on.

88
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,959
I've been waiting forever
to get in some training.

89
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:52,396
-Tell you what.

90
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:54,467
You help me while I finish
it, and we might have time

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,737
to squeeze in a little training.

92
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,593
-Ah, kink in my shoulder.

93
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,039
Hey, is that tea ready yet?

94
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,755
Great.

95
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:20,824
Thanks.

96
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:23,830
Now, I've forgotten what
I was going to write.

97
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,534
I need a long, hot soak.

98
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:32,750
-Of all the sensei I
had to get stuck with.

99
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,052
-[laughing]

100
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:38,161
-There he goes
again, more research.

101
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,165
-It's vital that
the secret documents

102
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,839
get to the Lord of the
Land of Fangs in time.

103
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,745
-I'm told that the delivery
ninja stop at this very inn.

104
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:48,450
-Perfect, then we'll
just leave it to them.

105
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:50,488
-Delivery ninja?

106
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:51,657
-The steam's clearing.

107
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:53,595
I'll get a good view.

108
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:54,998
This is just the
sort of inspiration

109
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:58,472
I need to finish my book.

110
00:06:58,472 --> 00:06:58,914
-Drat.

111
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:04,693
-How the hell am I supposed
to get inspired by that?

112
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:05,662
-Use your imagination.

113
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:07,532
Isn't that what a writer does?

114
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:08,601
-Yeah, for fairy tales.

115
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:09,971
But I deal in realism.

116
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:11,575
The real thing.

117
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,245
So would you mind doing
that jutsu, you know,

118
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:14,547
thing of yours?

119
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,519
-Will it really help
you finish faster?

120
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,756
-Definitely.

121
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,295
-Sexy hand jutsu, ultimate
steam bath version.

122
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:29,714
-Hi, Jiraiya.

123
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:32,888
-Hi, Jiraiya.

124
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,241
-Pathetic.

125
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,980
Well, a lot of good
that did for me.

126
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:45,582
Huh?

127
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,860
He hasn't written
one stinking word.

128
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:10,234
I double checked the address.

129
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:13,008
Now to seal it up
and it's ready to--

130
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:20,758
[groaning]

131
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,627
-The documents.

132
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,595
Oh no.

133
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,173
-Guard these with your life.

134
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,347
-We never do anything less, sir.

135
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:32,817
-Oh, my aching head.

136
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,930
Hey there, can you
deliver this for me, sir?

137
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:40,768
-Well, if it isn't Naruto.

138
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,772
Thanks again for
your help yesterday.

139
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,945
-Hey, Eight it's you
Mr.-- hey, wait a minute.

140
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:46,881
It'll come to me.

141
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:49,153
-596-03.

142
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,390
See?

143
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:53,762
-What kind of name is that?

144
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:54,664
Sorry.

145
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:57,671
Anyway, will you
take this for me?

146
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,109
-I'm sorry, I'm going in
a different direction.

147
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:01,379
Come on, please?

148
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:02,247
It's super important.

149
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,216
-Well, well.

150
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:05,788
If this isn't perfect timing.

151
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,325
-What's he, a shadow clone?

152
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:07,960
-Why no.

153
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:11,033
This is 463-72.

154
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:14,340
Here, I believe this address
is in your district, isn't it?

155
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,679
-It certainly is.

156
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:20,988
-Good, then I'll leave it to
you, whatever your name is.

157
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,727
-I'm 463-72.

158
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:24,362
-That's great.

159
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,698
Just deliver it.

160
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:31,677
Rise and shine, Pervy Sage.

161
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,981
-You let me fall asleep?

162
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,985
-So, are you ready
to start my training?

163
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:37,190
-What are you talking about?

164
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:40,463
I gotta finish that
manuscript first.

165
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:43,236
-No, you don't have
to worry about that.

166
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,374
I finished the thing myself.

167
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,979
It's on the way to your
publisher right now.

168
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:50,285
From now on, you can devote
all of your attention

169
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:51,487
to my training.

170
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,790
Isn't that great?

171
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:55,229
-Are you insane?

172
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,866
If they read that
gibberish of yours,

173
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,402
they'll never let me
write another book.

174
00:09:58,435 --> 00:09:59,738
-Do you think so?

175
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:00,172
Really?

176
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,142
It's that bad?

177
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:01,977
Sorry.

178
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,948
-Maybe, maybe it's not too late.

179
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,283
Tell me, how did you send it?

180
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:08,257
-I gave it to one of
those delivery ninja guys.

181
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,059
-Great.

182
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,063
The delivery ninja.

183
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:14,270
The most ruthlessly efficient
messengers in the world.

184
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,876
They'll give their lives to
deliver anything anywhere.

185
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:21,285
War, flood, fire,
nothing can stop them.

186
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:22,320
After him, Naruto.

187
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:23,189
Hurry.

188
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,059
We've got to try and catch him.

189
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,465
We've got to get that
manuscript back at all costs.

190
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,300
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
There's no doubt

191
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,502
he would have taken this path.

192
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,072
It's the most direct route.

193
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,344
The problem will
be closing the gap.

194
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:52,085
These delivery ninja are trained
for speed and they never rest.

195
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:56,494
-Hey, Pervy Sage, can we
slow down the pace a little?

196
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:57,296
I'm dying here.

197
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,365
-Shut up.

198
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:00,303
It's your fault that
we're in this mess.

199
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:03,042
Anyway, you wanted to
start training, didn't you?

200
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,448
To a ninja,
everything's training.

201
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,821
Just think of it as a
test, an endurance test.

202
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,494
-Well, now that you
put it that way, OK.

203
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,213
NARUTO: How are we ever going
to follow him through that?

204
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,183
It's like a maze.

205
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,389
If only Hinata or
Neji were here.

206
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,991
They're Byakugan
would come in handy.

207
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,128
-Byakugan.

208
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:30,435
Why didn't I think of that?

209
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:34,009
-Wait a minute, that's
your Rasengan, isn't it?

210
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,276
-Oh, sorry, miss.

211
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,211
[scream]

212
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,015
-Wait, wait, it's all right.

213
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,284
[chuckling]

214
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:54,620
-Hey, don't start that again.

215
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,391
Keep your mind on the job.

216
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,259
-There he is.

217
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:58,595
Hurry, Naruto!

218
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:59,565
-Right, coming!

219
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,415
-Hm, it's a hold up.

220
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:08,250
-Wait.

221
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,519
Stop, please.

222
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:11,624
-If you thieves think I'm
falling for that, you're fools.

223
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:13,928
-Hold on, there's been
a terrible mistake.

224
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,933
This boy gave you the
wrong package this morning,

225
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:16,869
and we need it back.

226
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,506
-We're not thieves, honest.

227
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,309
-I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do.

228
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:22,480
Once the package has been
entrusted to our care,

229
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:24,418
we must deliver it to
it's proper destination,

230
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,456
even at the risk of our lives.

231
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,560
-But if I don't get it
back, my career is ruined.

232
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:30,063
-You have my sympathies.

233
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,600
-OK, you forced me to do it.

234
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,104
Sorry about this.

235
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,058
-Poor guy.

236
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,228
We was only doing his job.

237
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,363
-Don't start with me.

238
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,535
Just keep in mind that
this is all your fault.

239
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:48,303
Huh?

240
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,274
What the heck is this?

241
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:51,343
This isn't my manuscript.

242
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,623
-When I bumped into
those guys this morning,

243
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,463
the envelopes must have
got switched somehow.

244
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:01,966
-Switched?

245
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,104
This is a secret
communication from the Lord

246
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:07,143
of the Land of Claws to the
Lord of the Land of Fangs.

247
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:10,384
Everyone, at least everyone
I've spoken to about it,

248
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:12,288
says the Claw and the
Fang hate each other,

249
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,360
and they're on the
brink of open warfare.

250
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,734
Oh, but this-- this
is an offer of peace.

251
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,537
The Lord of the
Land of Claws wants

252
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,475
to sign a peace
treaty with the Fang.

253
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,345
Well, that's a good
thing, isn't it?

254
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,582
Peace is a lot better than war.

255
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,552
-You bloody fool!

256
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:29,425
The fact that the peace
offer is here with us

257
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,995
means that the
manuscript of my book

258
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:34,002
is on the way to the
Lord of the Fangs.

259
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:35,071
-Ew.

260
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,541
-He'll think it was send
by the Land of the Claws

261
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,278
as some kind of insult.

262
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,314
-You're right.

263
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:41,551
And that will mean war for sure.

264
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,255
-We're off to the Land of Fangs.

265
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,458
-We're off where?

266
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,694
Ah.

267
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,564
-We've got to stop that
package from being delivered.

268
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:55,716
-I've been robbed.

269
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:58,154
This outrage must not
be allowed to stand.

270
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:08,577
-That's someone's alarm signal.

271
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:11,316
-This is delivery ninja 463-72.

272
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:14,021
463-72.

273
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,458
My mail bag has been robbed.

274
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:19,701
A tall strange looking old man
and a boy traveling together.

275
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,736
-Headed west.

276
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,640
Believe their next
target to be 596-03.

277
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,453
-All units in the area
are to respond at once

278
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,691
to apprehend the
thieves for the honor

279
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:33,063
and integrity of the
delivery ninja service.

280
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,719
-Straight up this river
lies the Land of Fangs,

281
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:46,659
and there's no other way to
get there but by water craft.

282
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:48,329
Hopefully, if we
keep our speed up,

283
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:50,401
we'll be able to catch
him before it's too late.

284
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:52,405
-Well, any time you
want to switch places.

285
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,075
-Are you complaining again?

286
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:58,251
I told you before, just consider
this part of your training.

287
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:59,253
NARUTO: Not that again.

288
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:14,520
-What are they doing?

289
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,657
-Reinforcements have arrived.

290
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,626
Paddle, Naruto.

291
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:34,897
Hurry, switch places with me.

292
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,121
Rasengan.

293
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:51,600
Rasengan.

294
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,439
-It seems such a waste
of an awesome jutsu just

295
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,709
to power a row boat.

296
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,746
-We're trying to prevent a war.

297
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,151
We've got to be willing
to use every single weapon

298
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,488
in our arsenal.

299
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,189
-Right.

300
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,792
-You take over.

301
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:04,594
-Oh, OK.

302
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,336
Shadow clone jutsu.

303
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,883
Rasengan.

304
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:15,485
Rasengan.

305
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,896
Rasengan.

306
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,901
-Look, there he is.

307
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:23,803
Ahoy there!

308
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:24,905
Stop!

309
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:27,377
There was a mix up of
documents this morning.

310
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,548
These are the documents you
were supposed to deliver.

311
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:32,388
-Trust us, you've
got the wrong ones.

312
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,357
Just take a look.

313
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,894
-I'm sorry, but I can't.

314
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,499
Once a package has been
entrusted to a delivery ninja,

315
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,439
he's absolutely forbidden from
ever opening it or examining

316
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:41,741
its contents.

317
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,381
-Listen, if you deliver that
package to the Land of Fangs,

318
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:45,349
it could start a war.

319
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,485
-I'm sorry to hear it.

320
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:49,357
Nevertheless, rules are
rules, and I have my duty.

321
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,529
-Oh man, you're too much.

322
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,500
-We're here, the Land of Fangs.

323
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:01,383
-I warn you, I will
not let you interfere

324
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:03,255
with the performance of my duty.

325
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,390
-OK, if you insist.

326
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,561
I guess we're going to have
to do this the hard way.

327
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:10,570
-Special delivery.

328
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:11,706
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER): Naruto?

329
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,842
Which one's our man?

330
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:16,683
-The one we want is-- uh,

331
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,924
-596-03, see?

332
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,528
-Oh yeah, it's 596-03.

333
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:26,237
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
OK, where is he?

334
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,545
NARUTO: Well, uh, uh, there!

335
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:32,852
Up there.

336
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,524
-Naruto, you go after the
one with my manuscript

337
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,696
while I take care of
the others down here.

338
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:39,266
-OK, got it.

339
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,720
All right, that's
as far as you go.

340
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,487
Just hand it over.

341
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:55,467
-In the name of
the delivery ninja,

342
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,941
I order you to stand aside and
allow me to perform my duties.

343
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,846
-Not that same old song.

344
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,884
Well, then in the name of
the Leaf Village ninja,

345
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:06,358
I'm going to take that package
off you no matter what.

346
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:08,328
-We'll just see about that.

347
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:12,404
-Sexy harem jutsu
swimsuit edition.

348
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:16,613
-Look, girls, delivery ninja.

349
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,752
[goofy laughing]

350
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,354
-I just love a man in uniform.

351
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,608
-No, no, no, no.

352
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,978
I have to get a grip.

353
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,884
I will not let
myself be distracted.

354
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,891
Excuse me, I have
a delivery to make.

355
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,841
Delivery ninja always delivers.

356
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,847
he lets nothing deter
him from his duty.

357
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,785
-Hey, don't be that way.

358
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,756
Where you going?

359
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,093
Why so rude?

360
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,063
Come on and stay.

361
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:57,502
The fun's just beginning.

362
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:00,041
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
OK, this isn't working.

363
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,644
-Hey, come on.

364
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:04,617
Help me out here, everyone.

365
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,100
-Sure.

366
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:26,914
-Delivery for the Lord
of the Land of Fangs.

367
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:27,749
-Thanks.

368
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,818
I'll see that he gets it.

369
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,245
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Unbelievable.

370
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,683
This guy must be
made out of stone.

371
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:51,668
-That's it.

372
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:52,836
It's over.

373
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,840
-So that means there's
really going to be a war?

374
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,594
-Wha-- what is the
meaning of this.

375
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,598
The original manuscript
of the next volume

376
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:06,600
of the "Makeout" series?

377
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,179
That Lord of the land
of Claws, ow could

378
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,816
he have ever guessed
my guilty secret.

379
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:17,089
The "Makeout" series
is what I live for.

380
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:19,694
Send word to the Land
of Claws that their gift

381
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:20,998
has been received with thanks.

382
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,605
There will be no war.

383
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,044
I don't want to be disturbed
for the rest of the day.

384
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:29,048
-I'm not sure what
just happened,

385
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,687
but at least there
won't be a war.

386
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,257
-Yeah, that's the good news.

387
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,596
What about my reputation?

388
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:38,035
That's my manuscript but
with your gibberish in it.

389
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,689
-Rise and shine.

390
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:50,161
Today's the day that Akatsuki
guy is supposed to arrive.

391
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:51,764
We'll make him tell
us what he knows

392
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:53,735
about Sasuke, right, Pervy?

393
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:54,737
Pervy Sage?

394
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,183
JIRAIYA (VOICEOVER):
Sorry, Naruto,

395
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,886
but there's been
a change of plans,

396
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,623
and I didn't want to wake you.

397
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:06,296
I'm off to track the
Akatsuki on my own.

398
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,340
-What a dirty trick.

399
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:21,261
Well, at least I got
some training in.

400
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:22,798
That's something, I guess.

401
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,022
[theme music]

402
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,449
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ready, guys?

403
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,417
Let's move out.

404
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,787
-Wait a second.

405
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:07,791
-Our mission is in the
Village Hidden in the Stars.

406
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:10,063
One of their stars is
in trouble or something.

407
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,332
-Naruto.

408
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,736
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Man, I'm
so fired up for this one.

409
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:14,506
And we've all got to work
together, right, guys?

410
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,078
Let's show these people what
the Leaf Village ninja can do.

411
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:18,080
Whoa there.

412
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,817
What makes you
think you're coming?

413
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,221
-That's right, Naruto.

414
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,881
You're not even assigned
to this mission.

415
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,249
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): What?

416
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:28,954
Next time, "Encounter, The
Boy with the Star's Name."
