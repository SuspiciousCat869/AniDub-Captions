[theme music]

2
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,013
-Whoa.

3
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,717
I can't believe all
the new buildings

4
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,053
they're putting up around here.

5
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,058
-I heard a lot of the
construction sites

6
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,395
are shorthanded.

7
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:08,032
There aren't enough
carpenters in the village

8
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:10,437
to get the work done, so they've
had to hire a bunch of people

9
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,539
from outside the village.

10
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:13,043
-Even I know about that.

11
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:20,494
It's old man Genno.

12
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:23,033
Oh, Naruto.

13
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,469
-You know him?

14
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,373
-Yeah, he's from the land
of sand and he's into ramen.

15
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:30,483
Sometimes we run into
each other at Ichiraku.

16
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,485
-How about it?

17
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,024
Want to grab some later?

18
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:34,926
-Oh yeah!

19
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,070
-Here you go.

20
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,506
-Thanks, it looks great.

21
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:40,973
-Enjoy.

22
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:47,656
-Ahh, no doubt
about it, Ichiraku

23
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:50,996
has the best ramen in town.

24
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,901
-Well, I'm glad you think so.

25
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,073
-Could I have some
more water, please?

26
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,476
-Sure.

27
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,414
-Ahh, that hit the spot.

28
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,616
-You're done?

29
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,521
-That one bowl was
enough to fill you up?

30
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:02,556
-Not really.

31
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,528
I could always eat more ramen.

32
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:07,568
-Here then, you can finish mine.

33
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,439
-Awesome!

34
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,711
-Naruto.

35
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,849
-Don't worry, they're
always like this.

36
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:17,123
-The way they act, you'd
think Naruto was his grandson.

37
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:21,232
-You need to loosen up
a little bit, Sakura.

38
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,741
You've been hanging around too
many crabby people-- Grandma

39
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:28,650
Tsunade, Shino, Ino,
Kiba, Kakashi Sensei,

40
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:29,819
you're all crabs.

41
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:30,888
-We wouldn't be so
crabby towards you

42
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:31,990
if you weren't such a jerk.

43
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,127
-See, you're doing it again!

44
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:34,931
That's just what
I'm talking about.

45
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,465
[punch]

46
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,668
-Ow!

47
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,171
-Looks like it's almost
time for me to go.

48
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:40,510
[chatter]

49
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:01,692
-Ow!

50
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:05,066
My head!

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,935
Huh?

52
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,906
Looks like the fogs rolling in.

53
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:12,517
So what?

54
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:13,653
Like it makes any difference.

55
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:33,933
-Lady Tsunade, I apologize for
waking you up at this hour,

56
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:36,305
but it has to do with the
man that the Anbu Black

57
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:37,842
Ops have been tracking.

58
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,713
-What's going on?

59
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,651
-I'm afraid he's alluded them.

60
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:43,188
-You mean he got away?

61
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:45,860
How did he slip through the
fingers of an entire Anbu Black

62
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,732
Ops squad?

63
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,235
What do we know about him?

64
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:52,342
You must have at least been able
to come up with a name by now.

65
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,179
-We went through the
most recent Bingo Book

66
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,885
and there was no one that
matched his description.

67
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,725
So I looked in an old book,
and I found something.

68
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:05,706
-Genno?

69
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,944
Could it possibly be
Genno the trapper?

70
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:09,180
-You think it's him?

71
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:12,087
-I imagine he must
be pretty old by now.

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,125
It's been so many years
since I heard that name,

73
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,029
I figured he just passed away.

74
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:21,241
I don't know why he'd be hiding
in the Hidden Leaf Village.

75
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:31,631
-I guess old age catches up
with all of us sooner or later.

76
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,608
I guess I should have expected
as much from Leaf Anbu Black

77
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,108
Ops.

78
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:47,033
-You need to return what you
took from the foreman's house.

79
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,038
-Why would I be carrying
something like that

80
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:52,981
around after all this time?

81
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:55,119
I've had a long, full
life as a shinobi.

82
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:58,059
And if this is how it
has to end, so be it.

83
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,863
I just wish I'd
lived long enough

84
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:03,939
to see the end of the Hidden
Leaf Village with my own eyes.

85
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:04,807
-Paper bombs.

86
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,681
Take cover!

87
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:11,423
[explosion]

88
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:26,825
-Huh?

89
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:54,221
-So then, you think
someone's planning

90
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:57,128
an attack against the
Hidden Leaf Village, right?

91
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:59,333
-For now, that's all we've got.

92
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:01,238
It's the only
possible explanation.

93
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:03,275
Why else would they
want those plans?

94
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:07,017
Besides, Genno's last words
would support that theory.

95
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,955
Even with the blueprints,
it should take time

96
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,224
to plan their assault.

97
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:12,496
But we can't gamble
our lives on that.

98
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,174
We must assume the enemy
could attack us at any time.

99
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:20,314
I'm going to authorize an
S-level emergency security

100
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,152
alert.

101
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,391
Leave only those necessary
to guard the village

102
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,431
and send every available
man to secure the borders.

103
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,970
Use whatever force
necessary, attack

104
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,507
anyone who attempts
to cross the border.

105
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,146
They must not be allowed
to reach the village.

106
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,532
-Wow, what a beautiful day.

107
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,002
-Naruto.

108
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:47,209
-Oh, morning, Sakura.

109
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:49,916
-This assignment
sounds like a drag.

110
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,321
-Nonetheless, I'll be
counting on you to handle it.

111
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,025
That's why I'm
asking you to remain

112
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,929
stationed in the village.

113
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,299
-But in order to
get this job done,

114
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:59,471
I'm going to need more
men than you've given me.

115
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,341
-We haven't got a
single man to spare,

116
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,480
so you'll just have to make
do with what you've got.

117
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:07,890
Under the circumstances,
they're the best I can do.

118
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:08,859
-The best, huh?

119
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,371
-Fog?

120
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:15,975
It was clear as a bell
when I went to bed.

121
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,847
I wonder where
the fog came from.

122
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,851
-I was wondering the same thing.

123
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,254
Maybe it was just a dream.

124
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:29,240
Doesn't it seem kind of
deserted around here?

125
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,545
-The place is like a ghost town.

126
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:36,122
They must all be inside because
of the special security alert.

127
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,091
-What?

128
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,260
Special security alert?

129
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:39,963
How come nobody
told me about it?

130
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,570
-As a ninja, you should
notice these kinds of things.

131
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,875
-But if we're under a
special security alert,

132
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,281
that means the village is
in a state of emergency.

133
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,586
Why didn't anyone
tell us about it?

134
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:54,463
-Maybe that's why Lady
Tsunade wants to see us.

135
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:55,867
[knocking]

136
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,637
-Come in.

137
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,874
-Thank you ma'am.

138
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:02,114
I brought Naruto like you asked.

139
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:05,255
-Hey, Shikamaru.

140
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:08,162
Looks like I'm not the
only one who was left out.

141
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:09,197
-Left out?

142
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,169
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,039
-Ha, never mind.

144
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,314
But what did you think about
all that fog last night?

145
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,683
Pretty weird, huh?

146
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:18,953
-Cut it out.

147
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:20,357
I told you, you were dreaming.

148
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,595
-There wasn't any
fog last night.

149
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,263
-You see?

150
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,299
I told you so.

151
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,269
-What you saw was a smokescreen.

152
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,941
-What are you talking about?

153
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:31,582
-I'll explain it all
once everybody gets here.

154
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:34,455
-Naruto, Sakura, the reason
we took the two of you

155
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,594
off the S-level
emergency security unit

156
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:39,033
is because we wanted you
to work under Shikamaru

157
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,603
on a special mission.

158
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:41,571
-What?

159
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:42,340
-That's right.

160
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,111
We're working together.

161
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:47,419
First thing you need to do
is gather a few more people.

162
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:47,953
-Hmm?

163
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,970
-Would you quit pacing
around like that?

164
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:11,373
Calm down.

165
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,579
-It's already past the time
we were supposed to meet.

166
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:14,647
-Not quite.

167
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,019
To be accurate, it's
still 20 seconds til.

168
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:22,465
-Guess he made it.

169
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:27,477
-What's up?

170
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,414
You guys waiting
for anyone else?

171
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:33,323
-Can you tell me why you're
always the last to arrive?

172
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:34,995
-I'm glad we're all here.

173
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,665
We can finally get started.

174
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,569
As I'm sure you're
all aware by now,

175
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:41,643
the village has been placed
under an S-level emergency

176
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,146
security alert.

177
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,683
You're probably wondering why.

178
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:47,155
-Last night's
smokescreen, right?

179
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,792
-You guys knew that
was a smokescreen?

180
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,362
-Of course.

181
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:53,102
My insects made
quite a fuss over it.

182
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,272
-Really?

183
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,575
That's funny, I didn't
notice anything.

184
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:58,515
-Maybe you should stop
eating and open your eyes!

185
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,385
-I didn't notice it either.

186
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,724
Could it be that I'm
worse than Naruto?

187
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,671
-Lee, do you have any
idea what caused this?

188
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:11,378
-I know it had something
to do with Anbu Black Ops,

189
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,449
so I did not get involved.

190
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:16,456
-You're right, the
Anbu were at the scene.

191
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,159
-Just as I thought.

192
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,596
-This is as much as we know.

193
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,403
The Anbu have had a man
under constant surveillance

194
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,207
for the past two weeks.

195
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:26,780
He had broken into the
construction foreman's house.

196
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,858
Once inside, he found the
chest containing the blueprints

197
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,230
for all the important
structures in the village,

198
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,700
and he stole them.

199
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,471
-Blueprints?

200
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,108
-So what's the big deal?

201
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,547
What can this guy do with a
bunch of stolen blueprints?

202
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,151
-What can he do with them?

203
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:46,091
Give me a break.

204
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:47,594
-Oh Naruto.

205
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,665
-In the wrong hands,
the blueprints

206
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,772
for the fort around the
village could prove disastrous.

207
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,242
-How?

208
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:56,681
-Once the enemy has a detailed
analysis of the structure,

209
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,586
it would be a simple
matter for them

210
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:03,130
to find the most efficient
way to break into the village.

211
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:06,404
What if they have the blueprint
to Lady Tsunade's mansion?

212
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,676
With that as their guide,
it would be child's play

213
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,850
to devise an attack on
Lady Tsunade's room.

214
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:15,291
-And if they were to fall into
the hands of an assassin--

215
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,394
-You're right.

216
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:19,133
I never knew how
dangerous this could be.

217
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,474
-That smokescreen last
night was something

218
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,313
the suspect used to
cover his get away.

219
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:26,450
-I see.

220
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,154
-Despite all the
smoke, the Black Ops

221
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:30,592
were able to corner him
in the eastern forest.

222
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,399
But before they could
get him to say anything--

223
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:36,706
[explosion]

224
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,645
-Anbu searched the blast site.

225
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:40,817
They concluded that he
had not been in possession

226
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,589
of the blueprints when
the explosion occurred.

227
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:45,193
We have to hope
they're not already

228
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:48,868
in the hands of the enemy,
or the Hidden Leaf Village

229
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,307
could be history.

230
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,782
You can see why Lady Tsunade
ordered the S-level emergency

231
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,319
security alert.

232
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,956
-So what's our mission?

233
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,726
What do we have to do?

234
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,631
-Since he didn't have
them when he died,

235
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:04,570
our mission is to find out where
the thief hid those blueprints

236
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:05,807
and recover them.

237
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,744
-It's like finding a
needle in a haystack.

238
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:10,284
-If we want to find where
the thief hid something,

239
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,491
maybe we should start out
by retracing his steps.

240
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,596
-The thing is, this
guy had a reputation

241
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,002
for setting some pretty
nasty booby traps.

242
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,474
And chances are, we'll
run into some of them

243
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:23,214
when we're looking
for those blueprints.

244
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:25,351
-I'd say it's highly probable.

245
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:26,621
-We understand.

246
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,626
Just give the order
and we'll get started.

247
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:32,000
-Well then, what
are we waiting for?

248
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,706
-You'll need some
background information.

249
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,511
We checked around
some and found out

250
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:37,914
that this guy snuck
into the village

251
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:40,018
a few months back,
posing as a carpenter.

252
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:48,037
-Wait, this guy is--

253
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:50,276
-The man's name was Genno.

254
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,318
-No.

255
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:55,869
No way.

256
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,276
It's impossible.

257
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,014
Old man Genno didn't have
a mean bone in his body.

258
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,288
He's just a sweet old man who
loved the ramen at Ichiraku.

259
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,594
He's not the kind of
person who would do that.

260
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:15,033
He wouldn't destroy the
Hidden Leaf Village.

261
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,469
-Come on, Naruto.

262
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,740
You thought he was a nice
guy, but it was all an act.

263
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,712
He wanted us to
let our guard down.

264
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,382
So when he got here,
he played the part

265
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,056
of the harmless old
carpenter to avoid suspicion.

266
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,895
-You can't love ramen
that much and be bad.

267
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:29,900
-No, bad guys like ramen.

268
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,336
They love it.

269
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,076
-Troji, maybe if you try and
talk some sense into him,

270
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,312
he'll listen.

271
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:36,916
-Though I've got to
admit, I've never

272
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:39,588
seen a bad person eating
at Ichiraku's ever.

273
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:41,359
-Told ya.

274
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:42,495
-That's great.

275
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,032
Thanks for helping
me out, Troji.

276
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:50,012
-Here's the list of all the
blueprints that were stolen.

277
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,984
I can't tell you
how ashamed I am

278
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,690
for not guarding
these plans properly.

279
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:58,967
I can never face
Lady Tsunade again.

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,508
-Which construction jobs
was Genno involved with?

281
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:03,510
-None.

282
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:04,980
He didn't work on any of those.

283
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:07,753
-But I thought-- didn't you
say that Genno worked for you?

284
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,423
-The structures on
that list involve

285
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:10,660
the safety of the village.

286
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,799
Outsiders aren't
allowed to work on them.

287
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:15,404
I always make sure that
outside contractors are only

288
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:18,010
allowed to work on
residential construction.

289
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,148
-So then you don't think
there's any chance he could

290
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:23,590
have slipped in and set
traps on these sites?

291
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,894
-We have excellent security.

292
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,801
-Right, but we should
check them just in case.

293
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:30,505
-Here, Neji.

294
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,980
-I think you're best qualified
to handle this, Hinata.

295
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,085
-Of course.

296
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:37,922
-I would like to
volunteer to help.

297
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:38,557
-Me too.

298
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,943
-I know I mentioned
this, but there's still

299
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:49,482
a chance the enemy hasn't
gotten those plans yet.

300
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,723
He evaded the Anbu Black Ops
for awhile during his escape.

301
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:54,193
So he could have hidden them.

302
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:57,568
-And you want us to think like
thieves and figure out where,

303
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:58,470
right?

304
00:15:58,503 --> 00:15:59,472
-Leave it to us.

305
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:08,058
-We're going on a treasure hunt,
Akamaru, so do your stuff, boy.

306
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,998
[barking]

307
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:25,966
-Ino and Sakura, I
want you two to go over

308
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,636
what's left of the
old man's body.

309
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,509
I know it's a long shot, but you
might be able to find a clue.

310
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,512
-Oh, please.

311
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,483
Why do we have to do it?

312
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:34,686
-Got it.

313
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,223
-Fine, if you think
it'll do any good.

314
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,108
Sakura, you really think
you can handle this?

315
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:47,181
-All that medical ninja training
will finally come in handy.

316
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:49,820
I can't be scared of
something like this.

317
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:52,059
-You may be fine, but
it gives me the creeps.

318
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,669
-Now let's talk.

319
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,040
The carpenter.

320
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:00,010
I need you to tell me everything
you remember about him.

321
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:02,282
I want to know where he
came from, who he talked to,

322
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:05,222
what he did, anything.

323
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,829
-I remember when he first
came to the village.

324
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,535
It was about three months ago.

325
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,241
He came to my place with
a letter of recommendation

326
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:16,147
from a famous master carpenter
from the land of sand.

327
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:18,754
I'm sure you're aware that
there's a bit of a construction

328
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,626
boom in the Hidden
Leaf Village right now.

329
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,033
Every local carpenter has
all the work he can handle.

330
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:29,846
We needed more skilled hands,
so I hired him right away.

331
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,652
He was an adequate
carpenter, nothing special.

332
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:35,191
I didn't see any reason to
offer him a permanent job.

333
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:38,967
But like I said, we needed
all the hands we could get.

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,105
He took his job seriously.

335
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:44,246
He always showed up on time
and did whatever he was told.

336
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:48,622
After he'd been
working here awhile,

337
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:51,595
I discovered that the letter
of recommendation he'd given me

338
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,932
was a fake.

339
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,271
I don't know if it'll do
any good, but here it is.

340
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,716
-So how did you figure
out it was a fake?

341
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,320
-I've been going
over my records,

342
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:04,325
and I found another
letter of recommendation

343
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:07,199
from the same master
carpenter 10 years ago.

344
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,637
Something struck me
as odd, so I decided

345
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,074
to compare the two letters.

346
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:13,212
And that's when I discovered
that the handwriting didn't

347
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:14,348
match.

348
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:16,920
-Do you mind if I look
at the other letter?

349
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:18,757
-Sure, it's over
here in this cabinet.

350
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:22,366
That's odd.

351
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:23,636
Can't seem to find it.

352
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,041
I specifically remember
putting it in here.

353
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:28,881
-It's all right if
you can't find it.

354
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:29,349
-Sorry.

355
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:33,358
To be honest, we
really didn't care

356
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,196
if the letter of
recommendation was fake

357
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:37,935
or not, as long as he
continued to do good work

358
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:40,007
and kept his nose
out of trouble.

359
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,345
I realize now that it was
a terrible mistake not

360
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,956
to notify Lady
Tsunade right away.

361
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:48,726
It never occurred to
me that the old man

362
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,433
could be a shinobi who was
sent here from another country

363
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,370
to steal our plans.

364
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,244
I still can't believe old
man Genno would do something

365
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,380
like that.

366
00:18:57,414 --> 00:19:01,890
Look, are you absolutely
sure he's the one who did it?

367
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:02,993
-I'm with you.

368
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,697
I can't believe
he did it either.

369
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:10,744
-Doesn't look like he set
any traps for us in here.

370
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:17,693
It's clear.

371
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,776
-This is where the
old man lived, huh?

372
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:29,053
-He was the perfect tenant,
always paid the rent on time.

373
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,358
A nice, quiet gentleman
with good manners.

374
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:33,229
Of course, once in a
while, he'd come home

375
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,467
after he'd had a drink or two
with his carpenter friends.

376
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,408
But even then, he never
caused any trouble.

377
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:41,280
-I guess I never really expected
this guy to leave any clues

378
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,884
laying around the
place he lived.

379
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,154
-Found it!

380
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:45,257
-What did you find?

381
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,163
-A lovely variety
of udon noodles.

382
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:51,170
He's got sweet,
savory, and super thin.

383
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:53,508
-We didn't come here
to look for food.

384
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:55,513
-But usually when
someone lives alone,

385
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:57,317
they at least stock
up on the essentials

386
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,856
so they can cook something
up when they get hungry.

387
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,794
There's only instant noodles.

388
00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:04,300
-Maybe he didn't like to
cook, so he ate out a lot.

389
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,307
Naruto said that he liked
the ramen at Ichiraku.

390
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,913
That is what you said, right?

391
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,382
-Yeah.

392
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,256
-But if he cooked at home, he
could spend less and eat more.

393
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,428
-We're not talking
about you, Troji.

394
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,424
-The old man really
didn't talk much.

395
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,830
And when he did, it
wasn't about yourself.

396
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,300
-Yeah, I figured as much.

397
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,237
-Oh, yeah, except
for this one time

398
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:37,042
when he came back from
lunch and went on and on

399
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:40,483
about this great kid he had made
friends with in the village.

400
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:42,354
-He probably told
the kid where he

401
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,258
hid the plans before he died.

402
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,065
-Yeah, well, I wouldn't
be too sure about that.

403
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:48,167
-What are you talking about?

404
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,537
It's the only lead we've got.

405
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,976
So we need to find this
kid and see what he knows.

406
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,346
-I think it would
be a waste of time

407
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,116
for us to look for
this kid, because I

408
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,820
don't think he knows anything.

409
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,023
-What?

410
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,860
How do we know until
we talk to the guy?

411
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,829
-You dummy.

412
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,534
We've already talked to him.

413
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,571
The kid is you.

414
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:05,206
-Ahh!

415
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,044
He meant me?

416
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:07,913
-Yeah.

417
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,082
No doubt about it.

418
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,420
-You're Naruto Uzumaki?

419
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,994
-Huh?

420
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:16,599
-I'm afraid we're going to have
to ask you a few questions.

421
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:34,407
[music]

422
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:05,115
TROJI: I wonder what sort
of interrogation Naruto's

423
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:06,217
going through?

424
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,253
SHIKAMARU: They're
probably using

425
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,322
some regressive hypnosis on him.

426
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:09,524
TROJI: What the heck is that?

427
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,195
SHIKAMARU: It's a
jutsu where memories

428
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:12,765
are pulled from
the subconscious.

429
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,533
TROJI: Huh?

430
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,205
You're kidding, right?

431
00:23:15,238 --> 00:23:17,209
Maybe it'll work on Naruto, who
has no sense of memory at all.

432
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:18,579
NARUTO: Won't be so sure.

433
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,049
SHIKAMARU: Yeah, that's true.

434
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,354
That old man seems to
have been a trickster.

435
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:23,791
I mean, what are you doing here?

436
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:29,030
NARUTO: Next time, the Anbu
gives up Naruto's recollection.
