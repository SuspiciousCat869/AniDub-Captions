SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I've got him that time.

00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,201
I'm starting to get the timing.

read my movements.

But that's not possible.

9
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,588
-I was so close, but I
couldn't quite get to him.

-Naruto, can you do it again?

-Huh?

12
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:16,960
Of course.

13
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:17,828
Nothing can stop me.

doesn't want to show it,

16
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,402
but he's exhausted.

17
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,606
The Shadow Clone Jutsu
uses up so much chakra.

18
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,244
But thanks to him,
I figured it out.

19
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:32,015
I know how to break through.

20

HAKU (VOICEOVER): The human
eye cannot track my movements.

It must have been a coincidence.

You think you
could keep me here?

Forget it!

be a limit to his chakra, too.

I faced anyone this tough.

And Sasuke and Naruto, I don't
know if they can hold out.

Stay calm.

to his movements.

Believe it, Sasuke.

HAKU (VOICEOVER):
It's not just luck.

106
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,796
He's fighting to
protect his friend.

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,198
That's why he's so determined.

108
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:37,738
But he can't possibly
see the needles coming.

109
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,541
-Ugh.

110
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:43,112
HAKU (VOICEOVER): My movements
are beyond human speed.

111
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:48,519
And yet he's tracking
them somehow.

112

Whatever he's doing,
I've got to stop him now.

How could he just vanish?

116

Naruto, you'd better
not pass out again.

117

Come on, let's go!

118
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:03,707
I can't keep protecting
you like this.

-Well, then, don't!

120
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:07,412
I never asked for your help.

128
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,803
You have excellent moves.

129
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,506
Your attacks are very skillful.

130
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,280
But you've reached
your limits as well.

131
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:39,524
Motor functions,
reflexes, judgment--

132
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:43,095
your abilities are
weakening slowly but surely.

133
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,734
Now, you're finished!

134
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,470
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Here he comes.

135
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:56,781
Stay calm, focus,
concentrate, see everything.

136
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:13,203
HAKU (VOICEOVER):
He saw every move.

137
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:17,542
But there's no way
he could do that.

138
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:28,057
Impossible.

139
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:31,596
Those eyes.

140
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,597
The Sharingan.

141
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,138
Pure.

142
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,040
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
It's not complete,

143
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:43,578
but I could see
through his deceptions.

144
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:47,618
HAKU (VOICEOVER): So he, too,
has a Kekkei Genkai, the power

145
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:51,256
of a unique bloodline trait
passed down within a clan.

146
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,493
Interesting, even though
it's not perfected.

147
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,732
To uncover this power in
the midst of a lethal attack

148
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,534
is an amazing feat.

149
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:04,207
And because of that, I won't
be able to fight much longer.

150
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:08,146
My jutsu uses a tremendous
amount of chakra.

151
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,083
And his swift movements
also take energy.

152
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:14,421
There's no doubt that
the longer we fight,

153
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,860
the more he will use the
Sharingan to perceive my moves.

154
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:25,503
Even now, his eyes
are tracking me.

155
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,177
I can't target him directly.

156
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,513
He'll just block
a frontal attack.

157
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:35,818
So I'll have to throw him
off-guard by attacking

158
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,753
his partner.

159
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,723
Then I'll destroy him.

160
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,198
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
I've got to stop him!

161

-Kakashi-sensei!

00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,555
-You were late, Kakashi.

165
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,762
You let your concern for
those little punks' safety

166
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:11,334
cloud your mind, adding
further to the fog that

167
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,271
already hinders your Sharingan.

168
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:17,308
Your eyes are sharp,
Kakashi, but not

169
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,046
sharp enough to read my moves.

170
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,614
Not anymore.

172
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,920
Come on, Kakashi.

173
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,522
I want this to be fun.

174
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:31,161
I want to enjoy myself
as I exact my revenge.

175
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:34,065
As for those brats, don't worry.

176
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,834
They're at Haku's mercy.

177
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:39,606
No, they're breathing their
last breaths right now.

178
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,749
Relax.

179
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,653
You'll have plenty of time
to whip out an apology

180
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:53,993
for failing those brats when
you see them in the next life.

No, I won't believe that.

185
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,045
I have faith in him.

186
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,981
Sasuke will beat them to a pulp!

187
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,150
Cha!

188
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,585
And that masked
kid, we'll make him

189
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:38,254
wish that he was never born!

190
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,956
I can't lose Sasuke.

191
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,227
Anyone who tries to take
him from me will pay for it!

192
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,931
And Naruto either.

193
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,899
KAKASHI: Exactly

-I-- I believe in
their abilities.

00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:57,647
I have faith in them.

197
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:05,257
Naruto, the number 1 hyperactive
knucklehead ninja, and Sasuke,

198
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:10,399
heir to the most powerful clan
in the Hidden Leaf Village.

199
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,735
-Huh, you mean--

200
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:13,736
-Yes.

201
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,209
His full name is Sasuke Uchiha.

202
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,946
The unique powers of
the Uchiha bloodline

203
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,817
run through his veins.

204
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,754
The Kekkei Genkai
is his birthright.

205
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:29,959
-Ah, I heard that
one young ninja

206
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,662
survived the tragedy
of the Uchiha clan.

207
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,944
No wonder he
advances so quickly.

208
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,584
But so does Haku.

209
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:51,789
No one can match him.

210
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:54,325
No one has ever stopped
his Secret Jutsu.

211
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:57,964
Even the most skilled
Jonin fall before him.

212
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:05,341
Just as you will fall
before me, right now!

-OK.

Uh, got it.

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,625
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): He's right.

217
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,094
It's time to end this.

218
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,696
But he is the one who will fall!

the way, Naruto.

It never fails.

00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,256
You beat him, Sasuke!

224

Huh?

225
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:59,516
-You should see the
look on your face.

226
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,221
You-- you look
like a total loser.

00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,522
-Huh?

228
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:09,697
Why-- why did you-- uh, save me?

229
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,233
Why did you do it?

230
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:16,639
-I don't know why, I just did.

231
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:25,986
-And my future dream is
to be the greatest Hokage.

232
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,022
Then the whole village
will stop disrespecting me

233
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:31,026
and start treating me like
I'm somebody, somebody--

the way to the top.

NARUTO AND SASUKE:
I want some more!

-Why are they so
obsessed with him?

It doesn't make any sense.

Why did you protect me?

My brother.

alive until I killed him.

found the strength

00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,126
he didn't realize he had.

267
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,360
Why?

268
00:17:56,394 --> 00:18:00,133
Because of a certain person
who was precious to him.

269
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:05,573
To save that person, he rushed
in knowing it was a trap.

270
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:09,513
He was a true ninja,
worthy of honor.

Is this the first time you have
seen a friend die in battle?

No.
