[theme music]

2
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,650
-Well, for starters, you could
wake up the spiritualist medium

3
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:55,050
to release that jutsu.

4
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,683
-How am I supposed to do that?

5
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,083
CHIEF TOAD: Just fire
off a few rounds at him!

6
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,183
Then again, I'm not particularly
good at transformation.

7
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,516
-Huh?

8
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,150
-Don't worry about it.

9
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:12,716
You shall act upon my
will and make a handsign.

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,116
A combined transformation!

11
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,083
Conjure up something
with fangs and claws.

12
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,550
Here we go.

13
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,050
Transform!

NARUTO: Beyond the limit
of darkness and light.

15
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,083
-It can't be.

16
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:16,283
-Boy.

17
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,483
They're not messing around.

18
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:23,150
-It's not safe here anymore.

19
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:25,183
-This isn't going to work.

20
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:28,083
His power just keeps increasing.

21
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,150
-Come on.

22
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:30,916
He just needs to a
good smack to the head.

23
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,683
-Tell me something I don't know.

24
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:40,850
Here we go!

25
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,016

You're on!

How's that?

00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:21,983
-Good.

35
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:24,650
Not much time has passed
since the medium went under.

36
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:28,450
that one blow should
have done the trick

37

-Aw, That's just great!

38
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,883
Give me a break.

39
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,250
I just got here!

40
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,383
-The jutsu's already faded.

41
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,583
-We may have released the
jutsu, but this guy's still

42
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,083
got some fight left.

00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,050
-I got him.

49
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,050
-The Chief's tongue
is surrounding me.

50
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,583
-You think I'm a fool?

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,383
-Damn.

53
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:30,150
How much strength does
this guy have left?

54
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,316
This ain't good.

55
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,216
Naruto and I have already
used up all of our chakra.

57

the face of the Earth.

00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,583
I will not cease to exist.

[groaning]

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,316
-It doesn't make any sense.

61
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,383
I'm shocked that not just
the sound but so many

62
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,683
Sand jonin would
try to infiltrate.

63
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,850
-Well, think about it.

64
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,316
That's why they call it war.

65
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,483
-Something's wrong.

66
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:21,850
It's unheard of for two
shinobi to last this long.

67
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,083
-What the hell is
going on in there?

68
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,183
OROCHIMARU (VOICEOVER):
He still has my arms.

69
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,850
I can't use any jutsu.

70
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,516
Don't you think it's about
time you took a rest, old man?

71
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:02,550
-I won't let this village be
swallowed up by your ambition.

72
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,916
-Nothing can stop my ambition.

73
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,016
You are going to die here.

74
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,716
I don't care if you
are Third Hokage.

75
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,783
You are nothing but
a withered old fool.

76
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:15,050
Do you honestly believe
you have the strength

77
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,283
needed to stop me now?

78
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:21,183
Have you even the
slightest idea what's

79
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,150
befalling your precious
little village.

80
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,250
OROCHIMARU: Even as
we speak, the shinobi

81
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:35,650
of the Sand Village
as well as my own men

82
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,950
have made their presence known.

83
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,716
It won't be long before your
people are annihilated down

84
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,350
to every last woman and child.

85
00:07:54,383 --> 00:08:00,716
The Hidden Leaf Village will
cease to exist! [laughter]

86
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:12,083
Sir, it's empty.

87
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,116
-The place is deserted.

88
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,550
-Something's not right.

89
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,916
-Huh?

90
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,916
-Why are we meeting with so
little resistance around here?

91
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,750
We're standing in the heart
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

92
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,050
-Sir, I--

93
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,616
-And another thing.

94
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,150
We've been here for a while now.

95
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:30,016
How come we haven't seen a
single woman or child yet?

96
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,683
-Ah?

97
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:47,483
[whimpering]

98
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,950
-Konohamaru?

99
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,283
-Are you OK?

100
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,783
Where are you going?

101
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,383
-I-- uh-- gotta
use the bathroom.

102
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:55,883
-Oh.

103
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,383
Yeah.

104
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,416
So do I.

105
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:57,983
-Yeah.

106
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:58,483
me too.

107
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,483
-Ah.

108
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:06,816
What the?

109
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,250
Konohamaru?

110
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,116
we are in the middle
of a crisis here.

111
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,816
Do you have any idea what's
at stake if they find us?

112
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,250
Now get back in that
room and you keep quiet.

113
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:17,216
-Yeah.

114
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,950
I know, but you
don't understand.

115
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:21,683
I've really gotta go.

116
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,616
-You'll just have to hold it.

117
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,616
-I don't know if I can
really do that, sensei.

118
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,983
-Boy.

119
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:30,283
You've got to be kidding.

120
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:30,950
All right.

121
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:32,250
Come along with me.

122
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,150
-I'm not going to make it!

123
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:44,216
[groaning]

124
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,616
-Aaah!

125
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,783
I guess that's all of them.

126
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:21,616
-For now anyway.

127
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:38,016
-Hayate, I will
avenge your death.

128
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,750
I promise.

129
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,816
-That's the signal.

130
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,550
Let's go.

131
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,050
-Right.

132
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,750
-For all your cunning,
you still don't get it,

133
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,516
do you, Orochimaru?

134
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:07,316
Do not to underestimate the
shinobi nobody of this village.

135
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:17,584
-Uh-- uh

136
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:19,884
-Are you all right?

137
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:21,251
Um-- yeah.

138
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:23,351
-So, is the evacuation complete?

139
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:24,251
-Yeah.

140
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,351
This here's the last of them.

141
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,451
-Huh?

142
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:29,584
What are you talking
about, sensei?

143
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:31,751
-If the village is
under attack, then there

144
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:34,684
are very specific guidelines
we have to follow.

145
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:38,918
-The very first step, wipe out
the enemy's advance forces.

146
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:41,818
And then if it becomes
clear that can't happen,

147
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,751
we immediately step
things up to Phase Two.

148
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,851
-The total evacuation of
every civilian to safety.

149
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,351
We'll move the
women and children

150
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:51,318
into shelters that
are strategically

151
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,118
hidden throughout the village.

152
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:56,351
Once that's been taken care
of, we continue to Phase Three.

153
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,618
-So what's Phase Three?

154
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,984
-The elimination of the
enemy by any means necessary.

155
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:04,551
-So then--

156
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:07,718
-As soon as we're ready, we
launch our counterattack.

157
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:15,518
-Huh?

158
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,018
-Not another step.

159
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,218
You are done here.

160
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:37,751
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): No.

161
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:40,218
Sakura.

162
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:44,651
-You have to save Sakura, if
it's the last thing you do.

163
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:47,584
NARUTO: Sakura, I
swear I'll protect you.

164
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,251
-Believe me.

165
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,751
I will kill you.

166
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:01,751
I will not cease to exist.

167
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,051
-I'm running out of time.

168
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:07,484
I have to stop this monster
before it's too late.

169
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,884
Come on.

170
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,651
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I don't need much.

171
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:27,318
Just give me-- give
me some chakra!

172
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,484
[shouting]

173
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,051
-What are you all waiting for?

174
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,284
He's just one man.

175
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:00,384
-Whoa!

176
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:11,218
-The Leaf VIllage's
spirit is strong.

177
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,484
You'd do well to remember.

178
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:18,784
-My-- my body-- I can't move.

179
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,551
-Come on, fellas.

180
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:26,818
You've never heard of the
Shadow Paralysis jutsu?

181
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:30,284
Then you're going to
love this next one.

182
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:34,751
The Leaf Village's
Shadow Strangle jutsu.

183
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:38,718
[scream]

184
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,718
-Expansion jutsu!

185
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:47,151
[shouting and screaming]

186
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,118
-Mind Destruction jutsu.

187
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:57,884
-What are you doing?

188
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,118
Stop it.

189
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,084
Stop!

190
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:03,984
[scream]

191
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:04,518
-Hm.

192
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:10,184
-Reminds you of the good
old days, doesn't it?

193
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,951
-You bet it does.

194
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:14,184
-The Inoshikacho Trio is back.

195
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,951
-Let's go, Kuromaru.

196
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:23,851
-Right.

197
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:27,884
-Never mind the odds our
Leaf shinobi are up against.

198
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:31,718
They'll lay down their
lives for this village.

199
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,784
HOKAGE: How little
you understand.

200
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:37,684
Mastering every jutsu
will not give you

201
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:41,618
unsurpassable strength.

202
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,551
-The poison in my body is--

203
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,518
-Try not to move, Shino.

204
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,484
I've injected my parasites.

205
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:51,418
They're neutralizing the poison.

206
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,351
-Dad--

207
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,784
HOKAGE: It was one
of my first lessons.

208
00:15:56,818 --> 00:16:00,584
It's not until you've protected
someone precious to you

209
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:03,084
that the true strength of
the shinobi can emerge.

210
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,918
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I'm
going to protect everyone!

211
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,351
Get ready, you crazy monster!

212
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:17,851
-Die!

213
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,718
-I-- I've had it with you!

214
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:59,018
-Did-- did he win?

215
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,984
-A plain old headbutt, huh?

216
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:05,318
Well, he's not the most
elegant fighter I've ever seen,

217
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:09,651
but to dredge up the chakra
he needed, worn out as he was,

218
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:11,651
he might be the biggest
knucklehead I've ever

219
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:14,351
come across, but I
haven't seen a kid

220
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:17,484
with this much promise in ages.

221
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:20,984
Wish I could stick around
to see how this ends.

222
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:24,484
But I've reached my limit too.

223
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,284
Gamakichi, it's
time we went back.

224
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:28,484
-OK, pops.

225
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:30,551
Let's do it.

226
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,984
[grunting]

227
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:44,451
[panting]

228
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:56,418
-That's it.

229
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,384
I can't go any further.

230
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:01,318
I've used up all my chakra.

231
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,618
And from the look
of you, so have you.

232
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,884
You a and I a lot alike.

233
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,184
More than you know.

234
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,951
We shouldn't be doing this.

235
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,918
-All right, then.

236
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:17,918
You and I both know I
haven't the strength left

237
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:20,218
to rip all of your
soul from its shell.

238
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,451
You and I both know that.

239
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:27,251
And yet, your ambitions
end here and now!

240
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:28,451
-This isn't over!

241
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,718
There isn't any
stopping my ambition.

242
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,451
-Yours is an obsession.

243
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:36,218
This need to be drown
yourself in jutsu.

244
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:39,251
And for this transgression
you shall be punished!

245
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,518
I shall take away all the
jutsu you hold so dear!

246
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:43,551
-What did you say?

247
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,784
Impossible!

248
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:55,784
You wouldn't dare!

249
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,784
-The seal is set!

250
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:03,251
[groaning]

251
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,718
-My-- my arms--

252
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,684
-There you have it.

253
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:20,218
Your arms are
useless to you now.

254
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:24,818
And without those arms, you will
never form another handsign.

255
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,051
Ninjutsu is forever
out of your reach.

256
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:34,284
Your loathesome dream
of crushing this village

257
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:35,784
dies here!

258
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:37,884
-You feeble, old man!

259
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,451
Give me back my arms!

260
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:44,251
-Your foolishness is
unparalleled, Orochimaru.

261
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,751
My one regret is that I
couldn't take you with me.

262
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,551
Farewell, disciple.

263
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:53,518
May we meet again
in the next world.

264
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,751
-You decrepit old man.

265
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,251
How dare you!

266
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:59,351
How dare you take
my jutsu from me!

267
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:25,884
HOKAGE: Where the tree leaves
dance, one shall find flames.

268
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:30,618
[growling]

269
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:33,651
HOKAGE: The fire's shadow
will illuminate the village.

270
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,751
[grunting]

271
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:59,751
HOKAGE: And once again,
tree leaves shall bud anew.

272
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:33,191
[theme music]

273
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:02,124
IRUKA: Hokage, the
aspirations you once

274
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:06,357
held have been passed down
to another generation shinobi

275
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:08,724
here in the Hidden Leaf Village.

276
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:11,591
One day, the flames
of their hearts

277
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:15,891
will burn big and bright.

278
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:19,391
It won't be long before they
illuminate this village,

279
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:22,957
as you yourself have done.

280
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:27,224
NARUTO: Next time-- the
Third Hokage forever.
