[theme music]

2
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,408
-As long as the
score isn't settled,

3
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,141
my heart is as
broken as this watch.

4
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:01,741
We are both stuck
forever in the past.

5
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,508
-Sagi, no.

6
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,475
Revenge is a poisoned
blade that saves

7
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,875
the most fatal cut for
the man who wields it!

8
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:13,408
-Fine, so long as I
take Moso down with me!

9
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:16,641
This darkness could devour
my soul, and I'd welcome it.

10
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,108
-It's just as you said, brother.

11
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:32,608
All this time, I have
fostered my hatred for you.

12
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,175
I've lived my life for
one single purpose.

13
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,041
-Sasuke!

14
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,575
-It ends here!

15
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,575
Enough!

16
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:41,575
You're dead!

17
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:45,441
My days of playing ninja with
you kids of the Leaf village

18
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:46,441
are done.

19
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:51,041
Now I'm going to
where Orochimaru is.

20
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,008
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
won't let it happen.

21
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,875
Not again.

22
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,708
I'll never allow you to
throw your own soul away!

23
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,941
Revenge consumed a friend of
mine until nothing was left,

24
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,975
and the only way that's
gonna happen to you

25
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,041
is over my dead body!

26
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:13,008
-I will see this through to
the end, and if you're not me,

27
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,741
then you're against me.

28
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,541
You'll never understand.

29
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:17,041
Ever!

30
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,308
-A fake wall!

31
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,908
-I will have my revenge.

32
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,808
I'm sorry, but you leave
me no other choice.

33
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:40,341
-What the heck is that?

34
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,641
-It's a cage.

35
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:43,141
-What do we do now?

36
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,908
NAGARE: Farewell and good
riddance, Hidden Leaf Ninja!

37
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,208
-Lightning Blade!

38
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:29,208
This should do it.

39
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,208
[shout]

40
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,975
[scream]

41
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:40,541
-How did you figure it out?

42
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,341
-Simple, really.

43
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,341
I've been keeping an eye
on that jutsu of yours.

44
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,575
-Now I remember who you are.

45
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:58,575
Kakashi Hatake, the copy ninja
with the secondhand Sharingan

46
00:04:58,608 --> 00:04:59,841
eye.

47
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,008
-Your jutsu is nothing
compared to Gaara's original.

48
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,908
Just a cheap, shallow imitation.

49
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,508
All you're doing is hiding your
body somewhere out of sight

50
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,508
and using chakra to
manipulate the rocks and sand.

51
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,341
-We are ronin, outcasts
with no village.

52
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,275
The dregs of ninja society.

53
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,375
That's why we travel
from place to place,

54
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:25,841
stealing what jutsu we'd
find, sharpening our skills

55
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,941
without benefit of school
or clan, looking for a land

56
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,241
to call our own.

57
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,108
But then, no matter
how hard we try,

58
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,108
I guess this means
there are limitations

59
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,541
we can never hope to surpass.

60
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,241
-Huh?

61
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:57,708
The feudal lord's
palace is over there.

62
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,808
MAN: Nothing yet!

63
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,641
MAN: Come on.

64
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:04,741
Give me a hand with this.

65
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:05,408
MAN: All right.

66
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:06,108
I'll be right there.

67
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,641
MAN: Lift, lift.

68
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:07,141
There we go!

69
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,475
-Hurry up!

70
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,741
Lord Sagi may be trapped in
the rubble, for all we know.

71
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:11,975
-Yes sir!

72
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,275
Faster!

73
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:14,941
Dig!

74
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,841
-Get these bricks!

75
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,941
-Man.

76
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:21,608
What kinda guy does
something like that?

77
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:25,408
Should've hit him
when I had the chance.

78
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,775
Could he be more of a jerk?

79
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:28,408
KAKASHI: Maybe.

80
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,275
What'd I miss?

81
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,541
-Kakashi-sensei!

82
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,808
Sagi squashed us like a
bunch of bugs and ran away.

83
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,541
We were just trying to help.

84
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,408
Man, what an ingrate.

85
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,975
-Please, try to find it in
your heart to forgive him.

86
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,275
-What do you mean?

87
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:45,741
-The angry young man who
attempted to kill us back there

88
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,241
is not the real Sagi.

89
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,241
-Say what?

90
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,941
Nothing fell on
your head, did it?

91
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,275
-Avenging the deaths of his
father and younger sister

92
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:54,308
is all that he cares about.

93
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,175
I'd even go so far
as to say that he's

94
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,708
possessed by the spirit of his
father, the late Feudal Lord

95
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,141
Owashi.

96
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:01,641
-Possessed.

97
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:02,575
By Owashi?

98
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:03,441
You're such a kidder.

99
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:05,875
Yeah, right.

100
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,675
-You shouldn't assume
that he was joking.

101
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,375
-Fine.

102
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,341
Can we just drop it now?

103
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,308
You know I hate ghosts.

104
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,441
They freak me out.

105
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,608
-Give it a rest.

106
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,775
This is no time for you
to be chickening out.

107
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:16,541
Come on.

108
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,041
We have to find Lord Sagi.

109
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:21,541
-Yeah, well, you know, we
have no idea where he went.

110
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,841
KAKASHI: If the feudal
lord truly is possessed,

111
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,041
his need for vengeance will
draw him back to this place.

112
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:29,608
He will return, and very soon.

113
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:01,441
[crying]

114
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:05,941
-No, Sagi, please--
please don't leave me.

115
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,541
First father dies, and now you.

116
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,841
I can't bear the pain
of losing you both.

117
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:32,041
Dearest father, and brother,
lend me your courage,

118
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,008
that I may rejoin you.

119
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,275
Sagi?

120
00:08:53,308 --> 00:09:03,341
But aren't you-- I promise,
your murder will be avenged.

121
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:18,008
But aren't you-- I promise,
your murder will be avenged.

122
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,875
Then time will
pass once again are

123
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,208
you, whose hands were
stilled too soon.

124
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:50,241
TOKI (VOICEOVER): I swore
that I would make this right.

125
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:54,575
Until then, however long
it may be, I live as you.

126
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:53,783
CHISHIMA (VOICEOVER): I know
Lord Sagi will be here tonight,

127
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:55,416
looking for a
showdown with Moso.

128
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,883
He'll see this through to
the end, one way the other.

129
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:01,816
-Huh?

130
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:35,549
-Heh.

131
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,716
Lord Sagi does his faithful
subordinate a great honor

132
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,983
in coming to see him.

133
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,783
A feudal lord is surrounded
by guards, but not the Cursed

134
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:44,616
Warrior.

135
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:47,816
He shall fight and die alone.

136
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,583
Fire Style.

137
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:50,483
Fireball Jutsu!

138
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:53,916
-What?

139
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:57,716
-Ha.

140
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,949
How pathetic.

141
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,149
A ghost swooping into battle
on a child's plaything.

142
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:35,716
I bid you welcome,
Cursed Warrior.

143
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,549
CHISHIMA (VOICEOVER): Lord Sagi.

144
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,716
-Mock me if you choose, Moso.

145
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:47,083
I will give you reason
enough to fear me.

146
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,349
-Save your breath.

147
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:50,883
It's among the last
you shall take.

148
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,849
-Fitting epitaph.

149
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:05,383
-Yes.

150
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,716
That's right.

151
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:10,383
Moso is just the face with
which I dupe an unwitting world.

152
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,249
My real name is Hoki, member and
leader of the Wandering Ninja.

153
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,316
With no village of our own,
we drift from place to place,

154
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:26,149
flotsam on the waves,
stealing the jutsu nobody

155
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,916
will deign to teach us.

156
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,149
But the years sit
heavy on our shoulders.

157
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:35,749
Our patchwork clan tires
of this vagrant existence.

158
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:38,049
That's why we've been
looking for a land in which

159
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,349
to end our wandering
and set down roots.

160
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,183
-So the truth comes out.

161
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,549
You've been planning
to take over

162
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,483
from the moment
you arrived here.

163
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:48,683
-How dare you judge our motives,
you spoiled, feudal whelp.

164
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,249
Fortune has favored you.

165
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,449
We of the wandering
ninja suffer in a way

166
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:56,083
you could never
begin to understand.

167
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:59,249
I see no harm in poor
unfortunates wanting

168
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,716
to find a place
they can call home.

169
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:03,883
But we could never
have come this far

170
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,549
had it not been for your father.

171
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,049
I assumed the guise of
Moso and charmed my way

172
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,683
into Lord Owashi's confidences.

173
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:16,349
All the while, the fool
never suspected a thing.

174
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:42,416
A dramatic bit of genjutsu
was enough to convince him

175
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,149
of Moso's magical process, thus
he brought me into the fold

176
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,083
as a trusted adviser.

177
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,483
Kome alone had sense
enough to harbor suspicions

178
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,649
about what I was up to.

179
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,349
So I painted Kome
as a malcontent--

180
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,616
after killing your father.

181
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,383
-That was you?

182
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,283
you're the one who
murdered my father?

183
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:04,249
-With pleasure!

184
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:08,183
And after I kill you tonight,
no one will stand in our way!

185
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,083
-Your evil ends here!

186
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:12,116
My dead cry out for vengeance!

187
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,016
-Can it be?

188
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,083
-Yes.

189
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:28,416
That's right.

190
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,049
Sagi's younger sister, Toki.

191
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,549
-Lady Toki?

192
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,549
-This is for my
father and brother!

193
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,583
-Shadow Possession Jutsu!

194
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,883
Well, well, Toki.

195
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,583
Observe how our respective
shadows intersect.

196
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:48,249
That's Shadow Possession
Jutsu, and you are now

197
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:51,516
mine to command.

198
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:52,683
Impressive.

199
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,516
I never imagined you were alive.

200
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,549
The wandering ninja
will control this land,

201
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,616
never to wander again.

202
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,983
And you, who lived as Sagi,
will now die like him!

203
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,416
-Lady Toki!

204
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,316
Don't give up hope!

205
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:12,816
-Chishima.

206
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,583
-So, you're still alive, eh?

207
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:21,949
-I didn't know it
was you, Lady Toki.

208
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,149
How could I have
ever been so foolish?

209
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:24,883
-Touching display.

210
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,483
Now die!

211
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:32,049
NARUTO: I heard everything
this power just told you.

212
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,083
Leave the rescuing to me, Sagi!

213
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:34,883
Toki!

214
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:35,683
Whoever!

215
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:37,116
-Naruto.

216
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,683
-Empty words!

217
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:41,383
My shadow compels you
to cut yourself down!

218
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,549
NARUTO: Real proud of that
shadow stuff, aren't you?

219
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,316
Too bad it's just another one
of your lame genjutsu tricks!

220
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:50,149
-Curses!

221
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,249
-Lady Toki.

222
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,783
NARUTO: Hey, Moso!

223
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,416
Shadow Possession is
Shikamaru's jutsu.

224
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,816
It's way our of your
league, you big liar!

225
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:04,883
Man, even your ninjutsu's fake!

226
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:05,649
-Show yourself!

227
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:10,949
-It's Naruto!

228
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,416
-Which one?

229
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,649
NARUTO: We all know what
you're trying to do!

230
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:18,483
Give it up now or I'll teach you
a lesson you don't wanna learn!

231
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:19,416
-Ah, yes.

232
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:20,816
The Leaf village brat.

233
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,949
Using clone jutsu, eh?

234
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:24,816
Fire Style, Phoenix
Flower Jutsu!

235
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,749
Those are solid?

236
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,216
Could they all be shadow clones?

237
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,183
NARUTO: Ha!

238
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,716
Sasuke's jutsu's
got you beat, buddy!

239
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,416
I hope you're ready,
'cause it's my turn now!

240
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:39,949
-Really?

241
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,316
Well, Kakashi Hatake.

242
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,816
I should have known
you'd be here.

243
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,816
-So you're Hoki, leader of
the infamous wandering ninja.

244
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,849
Your reputation precedes you.

245
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,716
A shinobi who's ever
creeping from place

246
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,316
to place in search of new
prey, like a bat in the night.

247
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,049
-Pampered ninja from
a wealthy village

248
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,683
can't begin to
understand what life

249
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,516
is like for the less fortunate.

250
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,116
-Wrong is wrong!

251
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,283
-We of the Leaf are taught
to face our difficulties

252
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:18,216
with honor.

253
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:19,783
That is the true
way of the ninja.

254
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:22,483
People like you who try to
better their lot through deceit

255
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:23,983
are ninja in name only.

256
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,083
Nothing but common thieves.

257
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:26,883
-Ha.

258
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,683
Elitist pig!

259
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:29,783
Summoning jutsu!

260
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,749
[roar]

261
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:45,283
-Those dragons look
like a real deal.

262
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:46,149
-But how?

263
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,449
-Wait!

264
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,883
-No way!

265
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,683
[scream]

266
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:07,349
-That's enough!

267
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:17,449
-Hm?

268
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,149
Just a projection?

269
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,383
-So the dragons he
summoned were fake as well.

270
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,916
-And It looks like he ran
off while we were distracted.

271
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:33,816
-He's in the mention.

272
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:34,516
-Not for long!

273
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:48,683
-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

274
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,849
Come back and fight
me, you big chicken!

275
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:08,849
I know he's here, but where?

276
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,849
HOKI: Look closer, Leaf Ninja.

277
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:12,349
-Huh?

278
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,283
-In-- in the screen?

279
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:24,583
HOKI: If you want Toki back,
simply come and get her.

280
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:25,149
-Yeah?

281
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,549
And how's that?

282
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:32,949
HOKI: Foolish boy.

283
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,449
Step into the boat.

284
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,783
-Genjutsu?

285
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:37,083
HOKI: Why do you hesitate?

286
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:39,849
Are you frightened,
Hidden Leaf puppy?

287
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:40,849
-Puppy, huh?

288
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,349
We'll see about that!

289
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,549
It really worked.

290
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,283
Who are they?

291
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:06,216
[giggling]

[theme music]

294
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,070
NARUTO: Maybe you don't
know it, or even care,

295
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:06,603
but Chishima always
believed in you.

296
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,736
Seriously, this guy
loved the Land of Birds

297
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,536
with all his heart,
and he'd do anything

298
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,836
for a friend, even when that
friend turned his back on him.

299
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,070
I know who you are, and I
know what you mean to him,

300
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:20,236
but even so, I'll
never forgive you!

301
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,536
You've said enough.

302
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,203
Time for you to pay!

303
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,903
Next time, When Egrets
Flap Their Wings!
