-(VOICEOVER) I feel
like I can't breathe.

One shallow breath, one
tiny movement of the eye

6
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,785
is enough to draw his attack.

It's suffocating.

If it goes on like
this, I'll go insane.

The clash of two Jonin

I've never felt
anything so chilling.

It's as if my own life

No.

You really don't get it, do you?

Your technique is nothing
but a crass imitation.

I'll never be defeated by a

You are full of

You'd already copied
my water clone jutsu

ZABUZA: Very
skillfully executed.

00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:25,633
You made your clone say those
words to draw my attention

while you hid in the mist
waiting for me to make my move.

kicked through

ZABUZA: You think wearing a
headband makes you a ninja.

When you've hoovered between
life and death so many times

90
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:32,264
it doesn't faze you, then
you may be called a ninja.

00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,901
When you've become so
deadly, your profile

92
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:38,406
is entered in my
bingo book, then

93
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,111
you may have earned
the title ninja.

00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:47,150
But to call up starts
like you ninja is a joke.

You can't win this fight!

105

He's using all his power
to keep me in this prison.

106
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:15,654
So he can only fight you
with his water clone.

107
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,491
But the clone can't go
far from his real body.

108
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,894
If you get away from
him, he can't follow.

109
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:21,795
Now run!

Not an option.

No matter how fast we
run or how far we go,

he'll track us down

If we try <i>amagni</i>

he can get around
it in an instant.

117
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:52,502
In the end, if we're on
our own, we're finished.

Our only chance of

You can only wear

when you graduate from the

Even Sasuke couldn't get to him!

179

We're only Genin!

We can't defeat a Jonin!

He never backs down!

His name's Naruto Uzumaki.

-Naruto.

195
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,118
-(VOICEOVER) Huh.

196
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:25,691
I thought he was all talk,
but this kid's got guts.

197

-All right, Sasuke, listen up.

198
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:28,662
Can you hear me?

199
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,097
-Yeah, I hear you.

-(VOICEOVER) Hmph.

202
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,236
Now he's got a plan?

This guy.

00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,544
So you're finally thinking
about teamwork, huh?

-(VOICEOVER) Why do
I have this feeling?

206
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,287
Naruto's so determined.

207
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,254
-All right.

208
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,058
Now, guys, let's go wild!

209
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,453
OK.

210
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:29,421
Ready?

211
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:32,726
Let's bring this guy down.

213
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,196
ZABUZA: Big words for
such a little man.

214
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,733
You think your plan's going
to keep you in the game?

-(VOICEOVER) Ugh.

This isn't good.

What are you doing?

218
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:43,573
I told you to run!

219
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,943
This fight was over the
moment I got caught.

220
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:47,811
Now, take off!

221
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,949
Your mission is not to
prove how brave you are.

222
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,918
It's to save the bridge builder.

223
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,956
Stay on mission!

224
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:57,724
-Huh.

225
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:00,495
Bridge builder.

-Well, I-- I guess this
all happened because of me.

228
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:09,206
Because of my desire to live.

229
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,644
But I won't let that
stand in your way now.

230
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,481
Forget about me, and
do what you have to do.

231
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,450
Go ahead and fight
to save your sensei.

232
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,252
-Hmph.

233
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,020
All right.

234
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,755
You hear that?

235
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:22,290
-Yeah.

236
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:22,991
Believe it.

-You really haven't
learned anything, have you?

240
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:43,384
Still playing your little
game-- pretending to be ninja.

241
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,522
When I was your age,
this hand had already

242
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,758
crushed many opponents.

243

The demon.

-Oh.

247
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:59,038
So I was in your book, too, huh?

248
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:02,709
-Long ago, in the Village
Hidden in the Mist-- also known

249
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:06,380
as Blood Mist Village-- before
a student could become a ninja,

250
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:09,852
there was one final test.

251
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,886
-Hm.

252
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,925
Do you know about
the graduation exam?

253
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,695
-What graduation exam?

254
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,297
[laughing]

255
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,599
What's the big deal anyway?

256
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:24,237
We had graduation tests, too.

257
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:28,476
[laughing]

258
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,281
-Did you have to kill the
other students to pass?

259
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:32,882
-Huh?

260
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:39,857
ZABUZA: Imagine young ninja like
you-- eating together, training

261
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:43,095
together-- and then
comes the final exam.

262
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,633
Only they changed the
rules-- kill or be killed.

263
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,870
You can't stop while your
opponent still breathes.

264
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:53,241
He was your friend--
shared your dreams.

265
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:55,277
Now, it's him or you.

-That's so cruel.

267

-10 years ago in the
Village Hidden in the Mist

268
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:05,257
the graduation exam changed.

269
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,996
One year before, a dark evil had
filled the school with terror.

-What's he saying?

00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:23,080
What evil?

00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,449
What kind of change?

273
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,385
What caused the terror?

pause or hesitation,

275

a young boy who was not even
a ninja approached the class

00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,170
[yelling]

337
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:37,779
[theme music]

338
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:08,597
NARUTO: Yeah, I did it!

339
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,731
The plan worked!

340
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,000
A ninja must see
through deception,

341
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:14,705
but Zabuza had no
clue what I was up to.

342
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:16,407
I totally fooled him!

343
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,541
You saw it!

344
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:21,213
The Hidden Leaf fighting
style of Naruto Uzumaki!

345
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,248
Believe it!

346
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,518
Al right, Sensei,
we got you free.

347
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:27,154
Now the rest is up to you.

348
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:30,959
Next time-- "Kakashi--
Sharingan Warrior."

349
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,407
Don't miss my first big victory!
