[theme music]

2
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,441
NARUTO: Assassin of
the Moonlight Night.

3
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:15,227
This, this guy.

4
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:21,127
Sasuke?

5
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,761
PAKKUN (VOICEOVER): Looks
like we were too late.

6
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:30,927
-Those two.

7
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:48,427
-What are you doing here?

8
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,327
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): He's
losing control again,

9
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,127
just like before.

10
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,861
Sasuke, hold on.

11
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:03,027
(VOICEOVER) Kakashi
sensei said that bruise

12
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,161
was nothing to worry about!

13
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,994
-Hey, uh, Sakura.

14
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,661
Earth to Sakura.

15
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:10,061
-What do you want?

16
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:15,427
-This guy over here,
who the hell is he?

17
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,894
-His outward appearance
may be different,

18
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:22,361
but he's the one
you know as Gara.

19
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,494
-My father used
Ninjutsu to ensure

20
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:28,694
I'd be the strongest of
Shinobi, infusing my unborn self

21
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:30,027
with a sand spirit.

22
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,161
And as a result, I
destroyed the life

23
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:35,361
of a woman who gave birth to me.

24
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:39,561
I was born a monster.

25
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,027
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This is
what he was talking about.

26
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:44,961
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
He did this to Sasuke.

27
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,361
-Hey, little girl.

28
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:47,461
-Hmm?

29
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,994
-I guess now would be
the time to tell you

30
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,661
I'm not the fighting type.

31
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:54,761
-I can see that
by looking at you!

32
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,161
(VOICEOVER) In any case,
we have to get out of here

33
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,861
and get Sasuke back
to Kakashi sensei.

34
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,461
-What do you want?

35
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,661
SAKURA: Sasuke.

36
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:13,494
-So, it looks like you're
good for two bursts-- that's

37
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:14,994
about your limit.

38
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:17,794
A third would be impossible.

39
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:22,827
And remember this, if you try to
force a jutsu, not only will it

40
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:25,227
not work, but the
attempt can drain

41
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:28,261
your chakra to absolute zero.

42
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,394
Worst case scenario-- you die.

43
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,894
Even if the worst
doesn't happen,

44
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:40,627
nothing good can come of
it, trust me-- especially

45
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:41,561
in your case.

46
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,527
-Because of the curse?

47
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,761
-If you let your hate
consume you, and rely

48
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,461
on the power of
that of curse mark,

49
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:01,794
your development
will end right here.

50
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:06,794
If that happens, you
will never beat Itachi.

51
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,094
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): I have
to get this under control.

52
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:14,661
-Sasuke.

53
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:17,261
-So, it's you.

54
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,061
You're the one I
didn't kill that day.

55
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,227
I live solely for myself.

56
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,594
I love only myself.

57
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,994
As long as there are still
people to kill in this world,

58
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:31,461
I will never disappear.

59
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,527
-Guys, get up, we
have to go now!

60
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,394
-Die, Sasuke Uchiha!

61
00:05:58,061 --> 00:05:58,894
-Sakura, no!

62
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:14,061
-Move it!

63
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:15,461
-[groan]

64
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:29,394
-Sakura!

65
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:37,461
-That girl must be out of
her mind facing Gaara now.

66
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:38,794
-Damn it, damn!

67
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,394
What are we supposed to do now?

68
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,561
We're screwed!

69
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:47,761
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I don't
know if I can handle this guy.

70
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,427
GARA (VOICEOVER): Now
let me feel alive!

71
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:00,227
Why can't I?

72
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:10,994
-No Gara, you can't do this!

73
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:29,361
-It doesn't matter what I do.

74
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:33,094
The sand just gets in the way.

75
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:34,694
-Gaara?

76
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,361
-Yashamaru.

77
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:39,894
As a member of the
Medical Corps, our leader,

78
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,827
Lord Kazekaje.

79
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,061
Has asked that I
see to your safety

80
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,427
and well being personally.

81
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:48,027
Please, Gaara, it hurts
me to see you do that.

82
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:53,627
Although I suppose that the
sand would protect you anyway.

83
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,927
-Yashamaru, sorry.

84
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,394
-What, this?

85
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:03,327
Don't worry.

86
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,361
It's a barely more
than a scratch.

87
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:10,294
-The wound you
got, does it hurt?

88
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,761
-Yes, a little bit.

89
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,194
But it'll heal in no time.

90
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,761
-Yashamaru?

91
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,261
-What's the matter?

92
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:30,694
-What does pain feel like?

93
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,494
-Hmm?

94
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:37,761
-You see, I've never
actually been injured before.

95
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:42,227
And I was wondering
what it was like.

96
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,694
-Hmm, how can I put it?

97
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:49,627
It's very difficult, or maybe
upsetting is what I mean.

98
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:53,227
It's like when someone
is struck, or cut,

99
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:56,061
it's a feeling that's
very hard to take.

100
00:08:56,094 --> 00:09:00,061
When you're hurt, you
don't feel normal.

101
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:02,061
I'm not explaining it very well.

102
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,894
Basically, it's a
situation you want

103
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,194
to avoid if at all possible.

104
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,227
-Yashamaru?

105
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,894
-Yes.

106
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:26,027
-Do you not like me, Yashamaru?

107
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:26,861
Like the others?

108
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,394
-Everyone goes
through their lives

109
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:43,627
hurting others and being hurt.

110
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:46,727
But it's not so easy for
us to hate one another.

111
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:52,961
--Thanks a lot, Yashamaru.

112
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,127
That helped.

113
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,494
I think I kind of
understand what pain is now.

114
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:57,161
-I see.

115
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,861
Huh?

116
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:06,127
-I think I might be hurting
too, just like everyone else.

117
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:09,161
I'm always in pain.

118
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:11,227
I know I'm not bleeding.

119
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,894
But lately I've felt
a lot of pain here.

120
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,594
-Wound your body,
and the blood will

121
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:41,727
flow, following fast
on the heels of pain.

122
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,594
But as time passes, the
pain eventually fades away.

123
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:48,861
With the help of medicine,
it can heal even faster.

124
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:52,394
But even more dangerous is
a wound dealt to the heart

125
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:55,761
because there's nothing that
has more trouble healing.

126
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:57,861
-A wound to the heart?

127
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,294
-Wounds to the
heart are a little

128
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,727
different from
wounds to the flesh.

129
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,861
Unlike an injury
to the body, there

130
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:05,561
is no medicine
for wounded heart.

131
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:06,827
And sometimes it never heals.

132
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:15,694
But don't worry.

133
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:20,094
There is one thing that
can mend a broken heart.

134
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,927
But it's a very
complicated remedy.

135
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,394
It can only be administered
to you by another person.

136
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:28,994
-So then what am
I supposed to do?

137
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:32,161
There's one thing that can
heal the heart-- only one.

138
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,261
It's love, Gaara.

139
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,094
-Love?

140
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,727
-You've got it.

141
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,794
But how am I supposed
to get rid of it?

142
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,427
What is it I have to do
to get rid of this pain?

143
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:47,094
-Don't you know, Gaara?

144
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:48,794
It has already
been given to you.

145
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:59,161
Love is a heart's desire to
serve someone precious to you,

146
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,561
to watch over them,
to care for them--

147
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,961
like my sister did for you.

148
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:08,494
There's no question that my
older sister always loved you.

149
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,127
Shukaku, the Sand
Spirit, is living

150
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:14,327
soul bent towards
the purpose of war.

151
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:17,461
The sand automatically
rushes to protect you,

152
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:19,594
just like the love of a mother.

153
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:22,027
I believe your mother's
will is carried

154
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,827
in every grain of that sand.

155
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:31,227
My sister, even after death,
wants more than anything

156
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:32,194
to protect you.

157
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,394
-Yashamaru?

158
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:39,594
-What is it, Gaara?

159
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,427
-Thank you for all of your help.

160
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,494
You know, for
stopping me before.

161
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:47,027
-You're very welcome.

162
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,461
After all, you're special Gaara.

163
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,027
I hold you very dear to me.

164
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:17,761
-(VOICEOVER) Can you understand
the pain that I feel?

165
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:31,194
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
It tastes like iron.

[inaudible] Yeah!

174
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,628
Kakashi, how did you take down?

175
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:21,128
-22.

176
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:23,228
-Looks like I win
another round, old buddy.

177
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:27,928
That last one l knocked
off was my 23rd.

178
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:29,862
-Yeah, yeah, all right.

179
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,095
-I love that too cool for
school attitude of yours.

180
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:36,028
That's why you're
my number one rival.

181
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:36,928
-Let's go.

182
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:37,562
-All right.

-[groaning in pain]

184
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:58,362
-Hey, Yashamaru, I
have a favor to ask.

185
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:59,762
-What is it?

186
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:01,995
-I need some of your medicine.

187
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,028
Sorry about earlier.

188
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,762
I know it must have hurt.

189
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:19,095
I brought you some
medicine, if you want.

190
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,962
-Get out here, freak!

191

--[drunken singing] What the,
watch where you're going,

little brat?

193
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:57,595
You're-- you're that kid!

194
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,562
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Again?

195
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,228
-Get out of here, freak.

196
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:04,495
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Those eyes.

197
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,895
-You're that kid.

198
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:09,895
-Why, why?

199
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,895
-Hey, look, [scream].

200
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,528
-What's going on?

201
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:20,595
-It's Gaara!

202
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,395
-Hey this guy is dead!

203
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:38,962
GAARA (VOICEOVER): Father.

204
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:54,195
I was right.

205
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:55,062
No one wants me.

206
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:05,228
Why, why do I have
to be such a freak?

207
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:09,562
What am I?

208
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:14,062
-Only one thing cures a wounded
heart, and that's love, Gaara.

-[weeping] Yashamaru?

210
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,162
GAARA (VOICEOVER): What?

211
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,062
Why?

212
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,995
Why me?

213
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:45,528
Why is it always me?

214
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:13,662
Who are you?

215
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,362
What do you want?

216
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,895
-You did well, Gaara.

217
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:54,062
You did very well.

218
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:04,362
-Yashamaru!

NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Those eyes.

221
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:20,628
-What's the matter.

222
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:25,362
Aren't you about to
make a run for it?

223
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:25,862
-Sasuke.

224
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:29,495
Naruto.

225
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,728
-Who are these two?

226
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:38,395
Who are they to you?

227
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:44,428
-Who are they to me?

228
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:46,695
They are my friends,
is who they are.

229
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,495
You trying laying so
much as another finger

230
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:53,762
on the two of them, and
I will pulverise you.

231
00:20:53,795 --> 00:21:00,195
-[scream]

232
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:01,195
-What's the matter?

233
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,262
Weren't you going
to pulverise me?

234
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,062
Well, come on then.

235
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:16,995

[theme music]

237
00:23:10,913 --> 00:23:12,880
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I
know what kind of strength

238
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,347
this guy possesses.

239
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,313
And I know he sees
me as nothing more

240
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:20,513
than some brainless weakling.

241
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:26,213
But still, what's this feeling
that's boiling up inside me.

242
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm not sure.

243
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:30,247
All I do know is
that I'm not going

244
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,047
to lose to this
guy, no matter what!

Dark, The Two Faces of Gaara.
