Gantetsu was telling the

Gantetsu wanted to make sure
at least the children would

-I've had enough of you.

330
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,181
-Ninja Art Mesh Cage.

331
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:32,119
-And now you must face me.

332
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,159
I did not even make a dent.

333
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,393
-Of course not.

334
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,762
There's nothing that
can penetrate that.

335
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:45,032
And now I want an
answer, friend.

336
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,767
-You won't get it.

337
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,502
So it's like that?

338
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:52,707
And what if I do this, hmm?

339
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,176
-[screaming]

340
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,610
-Akio.

341
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:57,678
All right, I'll talk.

342
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,380
I'll do anything you want me to.

343
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,715
Just stop.

344
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:04,318
-You should have said
that in the beginning.

345
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:07,088
-They're our victims,
these children.

346
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:11,158
They're all from homes
attacked by the Ninja Dropouts.

347
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,360
I rescued them, made them safe.

348
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:14,428
-You did what?

349
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:17,231
You rescued witnesses?

350
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,166
You betrayed us?

351
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,602
Did you take our treasure
and give it back?

352
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,437
-That money didn't belong to us.

353
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,307
It belonged to their families.

354
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,111
-Don't talk to me
you dirty traitor!

355
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,680
-Hey, hold it down in there.

356
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:37,118
Sorry if I kept you waiting, but
Naruto Uzumaki is on the scene.

357
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:38,252
-Naruto.

358
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:40,287
-I knew you would
make it in time.

359
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:44,058
-Oh I wasn't going
to miss the fun.

360
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:48,596
Just so you know, you're
not taking Gantetsu.

361
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:55,002
-[panting] It's Gantetsu.

362
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:09,083

363
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,760
-No.

364
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,762
Is that?

365
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,264
It can't be.

367
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:05,073
-Is that the Ninja
Dropouts' secret base?

368
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:08,009
Yes, they were probably
holding Akio in there.

369
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,110
-What a bunch of creeps.

370
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,445
They're going to pay for this.

371
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:13,181
-How dare they interfere
with a brothers' reunion?

372
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:14,249
That is unforgivable.

373
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:16,451
-All right, let's go bushy brow.

374
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,454
-Ready when you are, even
if the enemy are ex-Shinobi.

375
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,256
We're going to pound
them into the dirt,

376
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,225
and definitely get
Todoroki's brother back.

377
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:30,198
Next time "To Each
His Own Path."
