1
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:13,505
-Summoning jutsu!

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,384
-Hey.

3
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:26,752
Long time, no see.

4
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,122
-Sorry, but we don't
have time for small talk.

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,123
We've got a mission.

6
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:38,296
-That's the Village of
Artisans, unless I'm mistaken.

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,498
-Yeah.

8
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:40,699
The village has a
reputation for creating

9
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,335
some of the finest
ninja tools around.

10
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:45,404
They're used throughout
the five great nations

11
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,639
because of their high quality.

12
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,308
But rumors have been
swirling around lately.

13
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,111
-What kind of rumors?

14
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:55,781
-Something about them
developing an ultimate weapon

15
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,283
to attack the five
great nations.

16
00:00:58,316 --> 00:00:59,618
-Uh-huh.

17
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:01,687
So then our mission is
to infiltrate the village

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,822
and conduct a search to
find out whether or not

19
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,758
this ultimate weapon
really exists, right?

20
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,427
-You got it.

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,228
-Just leave it to us.

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,520
[theme song]

23
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:22,301
-[laughing]

24
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,336
-Hey, listen.

25
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,918
Something's weird.

26
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,448
-W-what do you mean?

27
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,410
-I mean the entire
village is deserted.

28
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,513
But I found something
even stranger than that.

29
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,013
-What?

30
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,889
-There it is.

31
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,925
-The coffin of Seimei,
the founder of the Village

32
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,926
of Artisans.

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,494
But where's his body?

34
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,596
-You see?

35
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,031
This is seriously weird.

36
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,168
-So they took everything
and abandoned their village.

37
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,604
But where did they go?

38
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,416
-Ugh, if I don't get
something to eat soon,

39
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,151
I think I'm gonna fall over.

40
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,587
In fact, I'm gonna
go all out and have

41
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,023
them put two eggs
in my ramen today!

42
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:20,394
[laughing]

43
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:20,894
Huh?

44
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,169
[scream] What the heck?

45
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,138
-I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

46
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,239
-Not at all.

47
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,542
I just got here a
few minutes ago.

48
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,477
-That's good.

49
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,145
Here you go.

50
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,147
I wanted to make
sure you got it.

51
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,215
-Yeah, right.

52
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,083
Why do I always get stuck?

53
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,351
-[laughs]

54
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,453
-Hold it right there.

55
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,554
-Hm?

56
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,056
-What do you think
you're doing sneaking off

57
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,290
for a secret
rendezvous like this?

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,092
Did you think I wouldn't
find out about it?

59
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:52,593
-Naruto!

60
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,927
-Huh?

61
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:54,862
-How?

62
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,163
How could you do this?

63
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,298
Sakura, after all the
times I've asked you out!

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,433
-What are you talking about?

65
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,869
Have you completely
lost your mind!

66
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:06,407
[growling]

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,108
-You mean it's just an errand?

68
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,143
-Yeah.

69
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,511
A new poison was
just discovered,

70
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,013
so Lady Tsunade sent me with
this list of ingredients

71
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,216
to give to Shikamaru's dad so he
could analyze them in his lab.

72
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,451
-Oh, man.

73
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,553
-You really shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

74
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,021
-Guess you're right.

75
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,891
-Oh, I forgot to tell you
guys that Lady Tsunade just

76
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,860
received a status report from
Temari and the Hidden Sand

77
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:27,861
Village.

78
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,029
-What kind of status report?

79
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,431
-Yeah, what's up?

80
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,533
-Well, I guess the Hidden
Sand Village has recently

81
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,568
started a ninja
training program,

82
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,337
and they've adopted the
same curriculum as the Leaf.

83
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,940
The only thing is Temari
and her two brothers

84
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,608
are going to be the instructors.

85
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,543
-They're what?

86
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,945
-How did someone
as mean and nasty

87
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,346
as her get to be an instructor?

88
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,948
-Really?

89
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,416
So Gaara's there too, huh?

90
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,229
-Before you begin
combat training,

91
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,530
you must first
choose a weapon that

92
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:07,468
suits you both
physically and mentally.

93
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,569
Yes?

94
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,005
-I'm sorry, but is it
absolutely necessary

95
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,140
that we all choose a weapon?

96
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,942
-Huh?

97
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,510
-Uh, why do you ask?

98
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,846
-If all of us have
weapons, there's

99
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,115
a chance we'll end up
hurting each other.

100
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,384
Someone could get killed.

101
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,986
-Your weapon is like--

102
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:26,453
-Huh?

103
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,899
-Forget it.

104
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,566
It's not important.

105
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,006
-This isn't a game
you're playing.

106
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,009
-If you were to go into battle
with that frame of mind,

107
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,144
you wouldn't survive.

108
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,312
-Uh, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,014
-Hey, if you're
going to make Gaara

110
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,950
mad by asking stupid questions
like that, you're on your own.

111
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,390
-For your combat
training, you'll

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,025
be working in a
group with one of us.

113
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,095
You may choose which instructor
you want to work with.

114
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,930
-I don't know.

115
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,298
-Gaara, would you smile already?

116
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,966
Don't look so mean.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,168
Lighten up.

118
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,503
No one will want to
be in your group.

119
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:20,073
-I hear my dad telling someone
that Gaara was the Hidden Sand

120
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,875
Village's ultimate weapon.

121
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,210
-Whoa.

122
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,845
-They say if he
gets mad, he could

123
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,413
destroy the whole village.

124
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,347
-He's scary.

125
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,183
I don't want to go in his group.

126
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:29,983
-All right!

127
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:30,984
I'm with Temari!

128
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,419
-Yeah, me too.

129
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,353
[chatter]

130
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,288
-It's really awesome.

131
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,389
She's got fans--

132
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,590
-He's the better
leader, isn't he?

133
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,291
-Cool.

134
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,602
-He was about to tell
us something earlier.

135
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:56,910
-Excuse me.

136
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,911
Will you be my sensei?

137
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,549
-Are you sure you want that?

138
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,852
-Please teach me.

139
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:05,319
-Hmph.

140
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,012
-What's your name?

141
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,081
-Uh, it's Matsuri.

142
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,048
-Matsuri.

143
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,216
You must choose a weapon.

144
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,899
-[scream]

145
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,042
-What's the matter?

146
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:02,542
-Uh.

147
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,082
-I want you to
attack me with that.

148
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:12,586
Attack like you want to kill me.

149
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,587
-Yes sir!

150
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,023
[scream]

151
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,158
-Beware a demon
with an iron club,

152
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,893
but that doesn't apply to you.

153
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,261
-Yes, sir.

154
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,497
Then which weapon do you
think would be best for me?

155
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,031
-Hm.

156
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,839
-This is called
the rope javelin.

157
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,308
-I've never heard of it.

158
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,982
-The sharp blade at
the end of the rope

159
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,383
is not meant for offense.

160
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,287
Its purpose is to keep
enemies at a distance, which

161
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,424
allows you to use the rope
to incapacitate your enemy.

162
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,429
You must practice
until the rope becomes

163
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,898
an extension of your body.

164
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,865
-Yes, sir.

165
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,596
-Who the heck are you?

166
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:39,072
-Is this all the Sand
Village shinobi have got?

167
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,874
-Hang on.

168
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,309
We'll let this one live.

169
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,946
He'll be a useful tool
in drawing our man out.

170
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,552
-What happened?

171
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,888
Kankuro, be be careful.

172
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,889
Who did this to you?

173
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,423
-Please.

174
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,290
Gaara.

175
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,393
He's-- you've gotta hurry.

176
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,010
-[scream]

177
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,159
-What's wrong?

178
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,194
-When I was young, I
stood by helplessly

179
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,364
as my parents were attacked
by so many weapons.

180
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,965
It's just so hard now.

181
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,937
-Tell me your reason
for wielding a weapon.

182
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,572
-Huh?

183
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,075
-I remember.

184
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:52,345
-Who are these two?

185
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,948
Who are they to you?

186
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,021
-Those guys are-- they're my
friends, that's what they are!

187
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,423
And if you even think about
hurting them any more than you

188
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:07,327
already have, I promise
I'll take you down!

189
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,030
-I'll never forget his face
when he said those words.

190
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,873
-That's Gaara.

191
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,274
He's the one we're after.

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,149
-It's a good thing
you showed up, Gaara.

193
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,984
We were just coming to get you.

194
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,887
-One of the ninja patrols
was attacked by somebody.

195
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,290
-They had strange weapons, and
they referred to themselves

196
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,459
as the Four Celestials.

197
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,329
They said to tell
Gaara-- tell him

198
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,431
that we know he's
the ultimate weapon,

199
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,101
and we issue him a challenge.

200
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,003
If you don't accept
the challenge,

201
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,339
they'll take someone
close to you.

202
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,508
They'll keep taking
one person a day

203
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,544
until everyone you
care about is gone.

204
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,288
-Hey there.

205
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,423
You're Gaara's
student, aren't you?

206
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,396
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to come with us.

207
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,152
-What's this doing here?

208
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,320
-Hold on.

209
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,126
Must be headed northeast.

210
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,328
-Matsuri was the first to go.

211
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,198
-But you know as well as I
do that Matsuri means nothing

212
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,933
at all to the Four Celestials.

213
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,000
They want you.

214
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,101
-Yeah.

215
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,503
-We must notify
the Jonin Council.

216
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:09,249
-They have identified themselves
as the Four Celestials,

217
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,384
and they've headed
to the northeast

218
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,421
to a small strip of land
between the Land of Rivers

219
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,189
and the Land of Fire.

220
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,058
It's near the Leaf
Village, so I've

221
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,127
asked them to assist us in this.

222
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,430
Temari, Kankuro,
and Gaara, you're

223
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:28,235
to leave immediately and
track these criminals down.

224
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,536
-That doesn't make sense.

225
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,838
They've already told us
that they're after Gaara.

226
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,140
If he comes with us, it
would be like walking right

227
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,175
into their trap.

228
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,409
-He's right.

229
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,579
It makes more sense
to send another unit.

230
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,982
-This might just be a
diversionary tactic.

231
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,951
If we sent an entire unit, the
village would be vulnerable.

232
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,621
-In that case, then, why
don't you come along with us?

233
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,321
Well?

234
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:57,163
-The enemy is obviously
after the Shukaku.

235
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,432
Gaara is the Sand's
ultimate weapon.

236
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,401
-If we already know
that, then why?

237
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,471
-Although he is powerful,
the ultimate weapon

238
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,906
is also a double edged sword.

239
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,043
If they destroy each other,
they'd be doing us all a favor.

240
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,449
-It seems the least I
could do is go with them.

241
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,617
-No.

242
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,319
This is something they
must do without your help.

243
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,454
I have another mission
that requires your skills.

244
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,195
-Are you coming?

245
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,463
Well?

246
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,132
-Sorry, but I'm afraid
there's another mission

247
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,967
that requires my attention.

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,135
Go.

249
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,903
After all, the captive
is your student.

250
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,838
-[growl]

251
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,309
-Come on, then.

252
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,276
Let's get moving.

253
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,425
-You think this girl's
going to do the trick?

254
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,927
-Why would he care about a kid?

255
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:01,861
-So what do you think?

256
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,029
Will he come?

257
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,398
-He'll come, because he
knows if he doesn't, we'll

258
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,902
just keep picking off those
close to him until he does.

259
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,473
-That looks like--

260
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,048
-Hm?

261
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,583
From the Sand Village?

262
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,518
Oh my gosh.

263
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,586
-Gaara?

264
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,921
Why?

265
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,189
-We're not sure yet.

266
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,591
The four challenged
Gaara and then took off.

267
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,427
The hostage is a girl he'd
taken on as a student.

268
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,029
They grabbed the girl
and then took off

269
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,132
from the Land of Rivers heading
toward the Land of Fire.

270
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,468
As of now, only Gaara,
Temari, and Kankuro

271
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,269
have been assigned
to pursue them.

272
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,038
I'm afraid that's
all the information

273
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,040
we have at this point.

274
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,210
-So based on that, I'm
supposed to set up an operation

275
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,546
to track down these arrogant
idiots who want Gaara?

276
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,014
-Yes.

277
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,950
It's important we maintain
our relationship with the Sand

278
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,151
Village.

279
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,352
-But they've given
us nothing to go on!

280
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,221
-They had even less
information to go

281
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,022
on when we asked
for their assistance

282
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,324
during the Sasuke incident.

283
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,593
-You can't compare this
situation with that!

284
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,429
It would be a different story if
we knew where they were going.

285
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,331
We could set up an ambush.

286
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,867
-None of the Jonin or
Chunin are available.

287
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,469
They're investigating
the Artisan Village.

288
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,570
Shizune.

289
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,572
-Right.

290
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:23,009
-You may select any of the
Genin who are on that list.

291
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,477
Time is of the
essence, so you need

292
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:28,148
to gather them together and be
on the road within 30 minutes.

293
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,349
-What about Sakura?

294
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,951
I don't see her name
anywhere on the list.

295
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,319
-No.

296
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,922
She's involved with her
medical ninjutsu training now.

297
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,290
-I'll accept the mission.

298
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,626
However, I have one condition.

299
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,627
-What?

300
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,863
-Let me borrow
Sakura for this one.

301
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,464
-Why Sakura?

302
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,908
-I thought I was
always the late one.

303
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,142
What are we waiting for?

304
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,277
Let's get going!

305
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,045
-We're still waiting
for one more.

306
00:17:59,045 --> 00:17:59,913
-Oh no.

307
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:00,980
Don't tell me it's--

308
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,849
-Huh?

309
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,417
-Sorry!

310
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,486
Couldn't leave on a mission
with an empty stomach,

311
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,956
so I stopped by Ichiraku
for a bite to eat.

312
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:10,890
-That's no fair!

313
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,925
How come you get to eat?

314
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:12,492
What about--

315
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,960
-All right.

316
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:17,030
Now that everyone has finally
arrived, let's get moving.

317
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:17,530
-Huh?

318
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,331
What?

319
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,466
You've got to be kidding.

320
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,067
I heard this was
some big mission,

321
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,570
and all the Genin in the village
have been assigned to it.

322
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,239
-Everyone is here
who's supposed to be.

323
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,607
-Oh, that's messed up!

324
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,943
I mean, I know Sakura has
training and all, but what

325
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,611
about Shino, Neji, and Hinata?

326
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:32,579
Shouldn't they be here?

327
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,980
-That's true.

328
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,182
I noticed that Akamaru and
I are the only ninja here

329
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,584
with any scouting abilities.

330
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,886
-So what you have
organized is a no nonsense,

331
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,921
take action group of ninja.

332
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,223
-That's right.

333
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,425
In fact, I'm calling this
Team Return the Favor.

334
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,926
-Huh?

335
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,895
-That's so lame.

336
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,498
-You guys remember when the
Sasuke incident went down?

337
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,167
The Sand Village was right
there to help us out.

338
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,035
So now we're
returning the favor.

339
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,303
You got a problem with that?

340
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,605
-Come on, guys!

341
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,908
Let's go return us a favor
from a long time ago!

342
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,110
-In case you've forgotten,
you're not in charge.

343
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,545
-[bark]

344
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,047
-We'll take our orders from
Shikamaru, the squad leader.

345
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,015
-Ugh.

346
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,483
Whatever!

347
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,886
But we gotta hurry up and decide
on a plan so we can get going!

348
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,320
What do you think?

349
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,590
Should we use the same strategy
as from when Sasuke left?

350
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,525
-Ahem.

351
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,059
There are definitely
similarities

352
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,327
to the Sasuke incident.

353
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,396
However, I believe
this pursuit and ambush

354
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,998
will require different tactics.

355
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,468
The trail's cold, so
Byakugan and Akamaru's nose

356
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,436
won't be as much help this time.

357
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,038
-I hadn't thought about that.

358
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,407
-I know it's unconventional,
but it's our only choice.

359
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,175
We'll break up
into squads of two,

360
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,278
and you'll work together
as a single unit.

361
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,414
You don't leave your partner
under any circumstances.

362
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,950
We'll pay back our debt
to the Sand Village,

363
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,452
but I don't intend to
pay it with our lives.

364
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,489
You all need to watch
yourselves out there.

365
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,456
-Right.

366
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,858
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

367
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,598
-Ino, you'll be with me.

368
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,432
-You got it.

369
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,200
-Choji, you go with Kiba.

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,102
-I'm counting on you, Choji.

371
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:03,970
Let's go.

372
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:04,837
-All right!

373
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:05,438
-[barking]

374
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,906
-Lee, you're with Naruto.

375
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,341
-Right!

376
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,843
Please refrain from
any indpendent actions.

377
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,379
-You don't have to talk to
me like I'm a little kid.

378
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,982
-The four people Naruto
mentioned earlier

379
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,951
have already gone ahead.

380
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,185
-Four people?

381
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,589
You mean Shino, Neji,
Hinata, and Sakura?

382
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,590
-Yeah.

383
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,191
They've been sent on
a different route,

384
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,960
and won't be participating
in the battle.

385
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,228
-Why the heck not?

386
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,098
-Isn't that sacrificing
a lot of our firepower?

387
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,866
-We'll conserve our
strength while they

388
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,134
search for the enemy.

389
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,003
And once the battle begins,
they can focus their energy

390
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,372
on healing the wounded so
that we can keep on fighting.

391
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,241
I had to think long and
hard about this strategy,

392
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,444
and your lives depend on it.

393
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,580
-All right!

394
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,448
Just you wait, Gaara!

395
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,415
I'm gonna make sure
I return that favor!

396
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,469
[theme song]

397
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,828
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): One of
them's a wind user, huh?

398
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:06,130
This is going to be fun.

399
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:07,164
She can deal with me.

400
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:08,532
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Fine, then.

401
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,834
I'll take the guy who's
swinging around the sword that

402
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:11,969
looks like a toy.

403
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:13,237
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
All right then.

404
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:14,438
Go ahead, Gaara.

405
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,040
GAARA (VOICEOVER):
Will you be all right?

406
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:17,441
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Don't worry about me.

407
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,977
These guys aren't worth
breaking a sweat over.

408
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,278
TEMARI (VOICEOVER):
Hurry up, Gaara.

409
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,414
She is your student, after all.

410
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:25,282
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Next time, Sand Alliance

411
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:27,951
With the Leaf Shinobi.
