ahead-- The Land of Waves.

Quiet!

00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:47,970
I told you, no noise!

12
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:51,540
Why do you think we're
traveling like this, huh?

-Mr. Tazuna, before
we reach the pier,

16
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:10,399
I want to ask you something.

17
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,845
The men who are after
you, I need to know why.

18
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,683
If you don't tell
us, I'm afraid I'll

19
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:28,188
have to end this mission
when we drop you ashore.

but to tell you.

23
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:56,793
No, I want you to
know the truth.

24
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:59,964
Like you said, this
is beyond the scope

25
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,233
of the original mission.

26
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:05,304
The one who seeks my
life is a very short man

27
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:08,241
who casts a very long
and deadly shadow.

28

Who is it?

32
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,421
-You know him-- at
least, I'm sure you've

33
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:20,457
heard his name before.

34
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:23,728
He's one of the wealthiest
men in the world--

35
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,698
the shipping magnet, Gato.

00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:27,901
Gato?

38
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,104
Of Gato Transport?

39
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,405
He's a business leader.

40
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,408
Everyone knows him.

41
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:33,842

What?

45
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:41,218
-Gato is a very powerful tycoon
from a famous company, that's

46
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,520
true.

47
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:45,991
But below the surface, with
the same ruthless methods

48
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:49,195
he uses to take over
businesses and nations,

49
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:55,703
he sells drugs and contraband
using gangs and ninja.

-[groan]

52
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,847
-It was one year
ago when Gato first

53
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,917
set his sight on
The Land of Waves.

54
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,921
He came to our island
and used his vast wealth

55
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:12,492
to take total control of
our transport and shipping.

56
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:17,165
Anyone who tried to stand in
his way simply disappeared.

57
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:20,135
In an island nation, a
man who controls the sea

58
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,475
controls everything-- finance,
government, our very lives.

59
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:28,413
But there's one thing
he fears-- the bridge.

60
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,684
When it is complete, it
will join us to the land,

61
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,720
and that will break his control.

62
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,159
I am the bridge builder.

63
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:42,465
-So that's it.

64
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,167
Since you're in
charge of the bridge,

65
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:47,438
you're standing in
this gangster's way.

66
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,142
-That means, those guys
we fought in the forest,

67
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,011
they were working for Gato.

68
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,748
-Ahh, Hmm.

69
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:56,183
-I don't understand.

70
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:59,521
If you knew he was dangerous,
knew he'd send ninja

71
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:04,227
to eliminate you, why did
you hide that from us?

72
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,901
-Because The Land of Waves is
a small, impoverished nation.

73
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,770
Even our nobles
have little money.

74
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,011
The common people who
are building this bridge,

75
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,516
they can't pay for an
A or B ranked mission.

76
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,085
It's too expensive.

77
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:27,023
If you end the mission
when you drop me ashore,

78
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,326
there will be no bridge.

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,364
They'll assassinate me
before I reach home.

80
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,272
But don't feel bad about that.

81
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:41,309
Of course, my sweet little
grandson will be upset.

82
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:43,712
He'll cry,
(CHILD-LIKE) "Grandad!

83
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,948
I want my Grandad!"

you for abandoning her father

We'll have to keep guarding you.

95

-Oh, I'm very grateful.

96
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,558
I win.

98
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,044
Tazuna, we've been
very fortunate.

99
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,513
No one has noticed us so far.

100

taking such a risk.

That's a snow rabbit.

But the color-- they only
have white fur during winter,

when days are short and
there's little sunlight.

152

This rabbit was raised indoors
away from the light, which

153
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:50,769
could only be for one purpose--
a replacement technique.

154

failed in their mission.

I'm ready this time.

I'm not going to
lose out to Sasuke!

-Well, well, if it
isn't Zabuza Momochi--

167
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,066
rogue ninja from the
village hidden in the mist.

168
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,036
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Rogue ninja?

169
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:07,937
Whatever.

170
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,773
Nothing's gonna stop me.

171
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,074
Ready?

172
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:13,612
Go!

173
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,780
-You're in the way.

174
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,350
Get back.

175
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,551
-But why?

176
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:21,121
-He's not like
those other ninja.

177
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,958
He's in a whole other league.

178
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:28,264
If he's our opponent,
I'll need this.

179
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,634
[gasps]

180
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,205
-This could be treacherous.

181
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:38,210
-Kakashi of the Sharingan
Eye-- Did I get that right?

182
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:44,552
It's too bad, huh?

183
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:46,788
But you'll have to
hand over the old man.

184
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:03,658
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Uhh.

185
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:04,225
Sharingan.

186
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,593
What is that?

187
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,229
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
What's he saying?

188
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:09,666
Does he have some special power?

189
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:12,169
ZABUZA MOMOCHI
(VOICEOVER): Sharingan.

190
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:13,170
-Now quick!

191
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,339
Manji formation!

192
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:21,014
Protect the bridge builder,
and stay out of this fight.

193
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:22,683
I taught you teamwork.

194
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,218
Now it's time to use it.

195
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:28,390
-Oh--

196
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:33,863
-I'm ready.

197
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:37,969
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Ah!

198
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:38,737
His eye!

199
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,239
What is that?

200
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:44,778
-Well, looks like I get to
see the Sharingan in action.

201
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:46,147
This is an honor.

202
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,550
-Everyone keeps saying,
Sharingan, Sharingan.

203
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,253
Will someone please tell
me what Sharingan is?

204
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,089
-Sharingan.

205
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:58,496
A rare power that
resides in the eyes.

206
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,268
The user of this visual
jutsu, or doujutsu,

207
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:05,305
can instantly see and
comprehend any genjutsu,

208
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,577
taijutsu, and ninjutsu,
and reflect the attack back

209
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,946
on the attacker.

210
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:16,720
The Sharingan is a special,
rare form of doujutsu.

211
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:20,258
However, there's more to
the Sharingan than that.

212
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,393
A lot more.

213
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,368
-You got it right, boy.

214
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,671
But you only
scratched the surface.

215
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,376
The Sharingan can analyze
an opponent's technique,

216
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,412
and then copy it to
the smallest detail.

217
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:46,359
As for you, jonin, in
the assassination unit

218
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:49,397
of the hidden mist, we
had a standing order

219
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,000
to destroy you on sight.

220
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,503
Your profile was
in our bingo book.

221
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:58,875
It called you, "The man who
copied over 1,000 jutsu."

222
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:01,478
Kakashi, the copy ninja.

223
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:08,187
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): What?

224
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:12,260
Is Kakashi Sensei
such a famous ninja?

225
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,829
-Wow, that's so cool!

226
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,200
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Wait a minute.

227
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,903
The Sharingan is
a rare trait that

228
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:23,641
only occurs in a few
members of The Uchiha Clan.

229
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,375
My clan.

230
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,117
Could he be--

231
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,520
-Enough talking.

232
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:38,093
I need to exterminate
the old man, now.

233
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:41,665
[grunts]

234
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:52,079
-So, I'll have to eliminate
you first, eh, Kakashi?

235
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:53,413
So be it.

236
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:02,492
-He's over there!

237
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,094
-Standing on the water!

238
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,341
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
He's building up

239
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,710
a huge amount of chakra.

240
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:25,355
-Ninja art.

241
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:26,457
Hidden mist jutsu!

242
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:40,308
-He vanished!

243
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:41,744
-Sensei!

244
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:45,181
-He'll come after me first.

245
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,851
-But, who is he?

246
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,921
-Zabuza Momochi-- the
ex-leader of the Hidden Mist

247
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,089
Assassination Unit.

248
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,860
He's a master of the
silent killing technique.

249
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,528
-S-s-s-s-silent?

250
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:59,167
-As the name suggests, it
happens in an instant--

251
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,603
without sound or
warning of any kind.

252
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:12,317
It's so fast, you
pass from this life

253
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,353
without realizing
what has happened.

254
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:17,357
The Sharingan cannot
fully neutralize it,

255
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:21,696
so don't lower your guard.

256
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:25,401
[gasps]

257
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:28,238
-Well if we fail, we
only lose our lives.

258
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:29,172
-How can you say that?

259
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,652
-The mist is getting
thicker and thicker.

260
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:41,655
-The Land of Waves is
surrounded by ocean.

261
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,658
The swirling mists
are ever present.

262
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,831
-Sensei.

263
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,280
ZABUZA MOMOCHI
(OFFSCREEN): Eight points.

264
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,283
-What's that?

265
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:06,922
ZABUZA MOMOCHI (OFFSCREEN):
Larnyx, spine, lungs, liver,

266
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:12,596
jugular, subclavian
artery, kidneys, heart.

267
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:15,733
Now, which will
be my kill point?

268
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,907
SASUKE (VOICEOVER): What an
intense thirst for blood.

269
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,344
One shallow breath, one
tiny movement of the eye

270
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,380
is enough to bring
on instant death.

271
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:57,255
If it goes on like
this, I'll go insane.

272
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:03,229
The clash of two jonin
intent to kill-- I

273
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:05,465
never felt anything so chilling.

274
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:08,402
It's as if my own life
has been choked off.

275
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,772
No, I can't bear it!

276
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,909
I'd rather take my own life!

277
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,211
-Sasuke!

278
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:17,348
Calm down.

279
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:19,551
I'll protect you with my life.

280
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:22,020
All of you.

281
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:26,025
I will not allow
my comrades to die.

282
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,996
Trust me.

283
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,500
[gasps]

284
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:32,901
-I wouldn't be so sure.

285
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:41,312
It's over.

286
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,221
-Sensei!

287
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:13,988
Behind you!

288
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:19,830
-Die!

289
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:34,249
ZABUZA MOMOCHI (VOICEOVER):
The water clone jutsu.

290
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:35,450
It can't be.

291
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,404
Even in the mist.

292
00:20:56,611 --> 00:21:00,549
He saw through my illusion
and copied it in an instant.

293
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:05,122
-Don't move.

294
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,110
Now it's over.

295
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,781
THEME SONG: Cultivate your
hunger before for you idealize.

296
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:53,052
Motivate your anger to
make them all realize.

297
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:56,857
Climbing the mountain,
never coming down.

298
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,295
Break into the contents,
never falling down.

299
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,104
My knee is still
shaking, like I was 12.

300
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:10,141
Sneaking out the classroom
by the back door.

301
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:13,980
A man railed at me twice
though, but I didn't care.

302
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,718
Waiting is wasting
for people like me.

303
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:20,588
Don't try to live so wise.

304
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:24,359
Don't cry cause you're so right.

305
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:28,365
Don't try with fakes
or fears, cause

306
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,534
you will hate
yourself in the end.

307
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:47,389
Don't try to live so wise, Don't
cry, cause you're so right.

308
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:51,362
Don't try with fakes
or fears, cause

309
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:54,533
you will hate
yourself in the end.

310
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:57,302
Don't try to live so wise.

311
00:22:57,337 --> 00:23:01,475
Don't cry, cause
you're so right.

312
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:03,044
Don't try with--

313
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:07,416
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh no!

314
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,918
It's not over!

315
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:11,688
Kakashi Sensei fell
into Zabuza's trap!

316
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:12,723
I've got to escape.

317
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,326
He'll annihilate me for real!

318
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,294
Uggh!

319
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:17,663
This pain.

320
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,099
Hey, what am I doing?

321
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,069
I made up my mind, didn't I?

322
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:25,146
I swore I wouldn't run
away no matter what!

323
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:29,012
Next time-- "The Oath of Pain."

324
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:30,812
Nothing's going to stop me.

325
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,679
Believe it!
