00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:18,882
I'm going to hit the ground
running today, so stand back.

13
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:23,415
Not that it matters though.

14
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:26,382
All my missions are
so lame these days.

15
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:26,882
Huh?

16
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:32,582
-Geez, I can't believe it.

17
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:33,582
This is so unfair.

18
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:34,982
-It's not so bad.

19
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,548
I'm training so hard these days
I can barely keep my eyes open.

00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:40,682
-Hey, Sakura.

00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,115
-Speaking of being lazy.

00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,515
-Oh yeah?

23
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,282
Well last I checked
you're just sitting

24
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:46,782
around a flower shop all day.

25
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,748
Where are Choji and
Shikamaru anyway?

26
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:51,048
-Off somewhere
with Asuma Sensei.

27
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:53,882
Oh man, I'd give anything
to be out there on a mission

28
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,748
right now.

29
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,748
-Ino was down with
a cold for a while

30
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:00,082
and the guys were sent off
on a mission without her.

31
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,815
-And I'm like totally
recovered now.

32
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:05,615
If I don't blow off some
steam, I'll just go crazy.

33
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:07,882
-Hey, nothing a little
training won't cure.

34
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,182
-Not at my house.

35
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,982
If my family ever find
out I don't have someone

36
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:15,448
to spar with, I get roped
into helping out at the shop.

37
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:16,482
-Whatever.

38
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:17,948
They know you'd just
skip the training

39
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:19,315
if you were on your own.

40
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:20,015
-Wait a minute!

41
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,182
That's not true at all.

42
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:22,148
Take it back.

43
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,082
I train by myself all the time.

00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:31,148
Shino, don't sneak
up on me like that.

00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,182
-Ino.

49
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,215
Naruto.

50
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,848
The Hokage wishes
to see you now.

51
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,148
-Huh?

52
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:38,382
Both of us?

53
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,248
-I was told to come fetch you.

54
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,215
She wants to see
all three of us.

55
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:42,948
-Huh?

56
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,382
-You, Shino, and me?

57
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,682
-Huh?

58
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,515
-Hmm.

59
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,748
-What kind of disturbance?

60
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:52,748
-Not sure.

61
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,715
Some sort of creature's
been terrorizing

62
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:56,882
our neighbor, the Land of Sea.

63
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:58,748
They call it the
demon of the ocean.

64
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,448
What's wrong?

65
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:06,548
You will go for me, won't you?

66
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:10,115
-Yes, milady.

67
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:13,482
-Shizune.

68
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:15,182
-Uh, yes?

69
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,415
-Give her the rundown.

70
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:17,448
-Oh, sure.

71
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:24,048
The Land of the Sea is composed
of islands of various sizes.

72
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,515
Lately vessels carrying
monetary shipments

73
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:28,715
have been coming under
attack, their cargo plundered.

74
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,748
-All the people on
board these ships

75
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:38,215
claim that the damage was done
by this demon of the ocean.

76
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,515
-And that's the mission, huh?

77
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,382
You want me to find this
thing and take it out, right?

78
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:43,815
-Well, almost.

79
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,315
There's a hair more
to it than that.

80
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:49,682
-The Land of the Sea has no
hidden village, not of its own.

81
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,748
So they've established
a military alliance

82
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,782
with their neighbor,
the Land of Water.

83
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:56,415
They make payments every
month, but the ship

84
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,882
carrying their
latest installment

85
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,148
was attacked by the demon
of the ocean as well.

86
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:02,415
-I get it.

87
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:05,015
To preserve their relationship
with the land of water,

88
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,582
the Land of the Sea
will do whatever

89
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,615
it takes to protect
their next ship.

90
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:09,815
-Bingo.

91
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:12,148
Your mission is to safeguard
the latest delivery

92
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:14,382
and take out this demon.

93
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,315
Your support team has
already been assembled.

94
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,948
The rest I leave to you.

95
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:18,915
-Support team?

96
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:20,382
[knock on door]

97
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,882
-Enter.

98
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:27,682
-What the?

99
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:30,715
You're that psycho proctor
from the Chunin exams.

100
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:35,882
-Yeah, good times.

101
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:38,482
Feels like it was only
yesterday, doesn't it?

102
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:40,782
-Anko Mitarashi, Sensei?

103
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,382
-So what are you doing here?

104
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:43,182
-Listen up.

105
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,515
Your mission is as follows.

106
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:49,048
Shino Aburame, Ino
Yamanaka, Naruto Uzumaki.

107
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:51,348
You three will be
working as a team

108
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,915
under Anko for this assignment.

109
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:54,415
What she says goes.

110
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,448
-You're putting the
three of us together?

111
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,948
-Seriously, it is kind of
a weird match, isn't it?

112
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,615
-I don't want to hear it.

113
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,682
Now look, I've
thought this through.

114
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:05,182
Each of your specific skill
sets will combine perfectly

115
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,548
for this mission.

116
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:09,315
I hand picked you all myself.

117
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,748
Now put those abilities
of yours to good use

118
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,848
and get the job done.

119
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,115
-Right.

120
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:16,582
-Hand picked?

121
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,348
These were the only
Genin available.

122
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,748
She's too much.

123
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:22,748
-[laughs]

124
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:25,682
-Something here
doesn't smell right.

125
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,748
-OK, you've got your
marching orders.

126
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,348
Zip it.

127
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,648
-Ow, ow, ow, ow.

128
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,148
All right, all right.

129
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,982
-Now then, let's get
this show on the road.

130
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,815
Go pack your gear and
meet me at the front gate.

131
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:37,748
-Roger.

132
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:38,982
-Man, that really hurt.

133
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:41,948
-Anko.

134
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:48,782
Be careful.

135
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:53,548
-Right.

136
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,982
-Demon of the ocean.

137
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:08,115
Has physical traits both
human and fish like.

138
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,315
What is this?

139
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:11,015
-These people need to
have their eyes examined.

140
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:13,082
Something like
that doesn't exist.

141
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:14,615
-Not necessarily.

142
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:17,215
This could be ninja
resorting to piracy

143
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,548
with genjutsu at their disposal.

144
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,782
-Well, whatever.

145
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:22,315
We still need to look into it.

146
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,215
This problem's not
solving itself.

147
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:25,315
-Of course.

148
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:26,915
-All, right, Mother
Island's at the center

149
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,248
of the Land of the Sea.

150
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:31,282
Let's head to the nearest
port town and charter a boat.

151
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:31,848
-Got it.

152
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:32,948
-All right.

153
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:36,882
OK, let's set sail for
the Land of the Sea.

154
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:39,748
-Why does he always
have to be gung-ho?

155
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,615
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

156
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:46,515
-Here you are.

157
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:51,915
So, um, Lady Tsunade?

158
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,082
-Hmm?

159
00:08:56,115 --> 00:09:01,482
-About Anko, I was
wondering, I mean, well,

160
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,848
did something
happen in the past?

161
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:08,748
-Sort of.

162
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,848
-Wait a second.

163
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:20,082
This file.

164
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,948
These are her mission
records from age 10 and on.

165
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:24,148
They're so fragmented.

166
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:28,515
-Anko was one of Orochimaru's
students once, remember?

167
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,882
-So the passages blacked
out are connected

168
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:32,815
to Orochimaru's activity.

169
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:35,448
So they correspond to
confidential files.

170
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:37,082
-Well, some of them.

171
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,982
-Huh?

172
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:42,748
-For parts of it we
have no record at all.

173
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,315
-No record at all?

174
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:47,482
Even for the entire period
she was here in the village?

175
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:51,215
-[sighs] That Orochimaru.

176
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:55,782
He must not have wanted
anyone to know he was doing.

177
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:58,515
When he left the village,
he was careful to erase

178
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,848
sections of Anko's memory.

179
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:05,615
-Ah, smell that ocean air.

180
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:06,882
-Well, we made it, you guys.

181
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,682
Feast your eyes on
the Land of the Sea.

182
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,715
-So is that Mother Island then?

183
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:32,915
[panting]

184
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:48,682
-What is this feeling
coming over me?

185
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,719
Hey guys, just go
on ahead will you?

186
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,752
See if you go
rustle up that boat.

187
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:06,386
-Yeah, but Sensei--

188
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,419
-I have some business
to take care of.

189
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,419
I'll catch up with you
as soon as I'm done.

190
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:11,419
Back in a bit.

191
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:12,719
-Sensei.

192
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:13,852
-Ah, don't bother.

193
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:15,619
Come on.

194
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:16,719
Shino, what are you doing?

195
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:18,919
-You want to get left behind?

196
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:19,419
-Right.

197
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,552
-This curse mark is killing me.

198
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,352
His presence.

199
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,419
There's no question.

200
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:32,952
This way.

201
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:59,152
--[laughs] I know
which ones are which.

202
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,352
Let me see.

203
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,619
That one is Mother
Island, that's

204
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:05,052
Taro, and that
one's Jiro Island.

205
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:09,019
And, uh, that
one's Demon Island.

206
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:12,052
-Certainly done your
homework, haven't you?

207
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:15,319
--[laughs] Yeah, well, I
kind of have to, right?

208
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:18,419
If I want to be a shinobi with
strength and wisdom like you.

209
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:21,919
-[laughs]

210
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:32,186
-Here you are.

211
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:40,586
Uh, I'm sorry, but
that's the best I can do.

212
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:42,919
-Hey, Ino, what's wrong?

213
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:44,319
-Hold on one second.

214
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:46,619
That's kind of a low
price, don't you think?

215
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:48,819
That's high quality fish.

216
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,019
-Uh, well, look, I'm
not underpaying her.

217
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:56,386
It's just with all this hubbub
over this demon of the ocean,

218
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:59,252
customers have been
scarce for a while.

219
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,619
Sorry, but that's the
going price these days.

220
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,386
-You've got to be kidding me.

221
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,386
That fish rarely goes for--

222
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,086
-Wow, that's a lot of bandages.

223
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,786
She injure herself or something?

224
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:12,086
-No.

225
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:14,319
But there's something wrong
with her, that's for sure.

226
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:15,952
She's actually a diver.

227
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:18,452
She lives in a small town
over on Mother Island.

228
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:20,286
-Huh?

229
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:22,319
But if she's an
islander, then what's

230
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,186
she coming to the mainland for?

231
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,186
-Oh, well, uh, that's because
the other people of the island

232
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:30,119
won't do business with her.

233
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:33,486
Not long ago she-- she
was taken away by spirits.

234
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,019
-What are you talking about?

235
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:38,719
-You're saying that she suddenly
disappeared then, right?

236
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,052
-You got it.

237
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:43,086
One day a bunch of the
islanders just up and vanished.

238
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,019
Story is out of
all those people,

239
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:47,619
only she turned up again.

240
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,019
We're a small village.

241
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,386
She makes everyone
a bit nervous.

242
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:57,286
-It's a monster!

243
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,686
-[crying]

244
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:04,019
-They say she lives outside
the village now, alone.

245
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,652
-Oh, wow.

246
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,952
I feel so sorry for her.

247
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:10,519
-Looking like that and
then with all the stories

248
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,786
we hear, how can you
not feel on edge?

249
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,252
-[crying]

250
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,686
-Yeah, I guess.

251
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,852
Where'd Naruto go?

252
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:20,586
-I don't know.

253
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,152
-Hey What do you
think you're doing?

254
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,852
-Let's go.

255
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:56,086
-Are you OK?

256
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,852
-Yeah.

257
00:14:57,886 --> 00:15:03,186
--[laughs] So, um, you're from
over on Mother's Island, right?

258
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:06,586
-No.

259
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:11,386
A ninja.

260
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:12,886
-Let me help you.

261
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,186
-That's OK.

262
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:14,919
-Huh?

263
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,519
Hey, wait.

264
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:18,586
What's up with her?

265
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:27,452
-I'm sorry but the last boat
of the day has already set out.

266
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:28,419
-You're kidding.

267
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,152
The sun hasn't
even gone down yet.

268
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,919
-There's no way you're
going to find anyone

269
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:34,519
around here who will take you
out this late in the evening.

270
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,019
I'm sorry, you're
just going to have

271
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:37,352
to come back in the morning.

272
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,686
-So much for that.

273
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,519
-Is there any other way
to get to the island

274
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:42,152
besides the ferry?

275
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:46,452
-Well, I can't say I advise
it, but if it's really

276
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,919
that important, I own a
small skiff you could borrow.

277
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,352
-Finally.

278
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,286
I've been looking
all over for you.

279
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:58,419
-It's about time.

280
00:15:58,452 --> 00:15:59,852
Where the heck have you been?

281
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:02,052
-Oh, right, sorry.

282
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,719
-You should have said
something before taking off.

283
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,952
-Boy, you and our squad
leader are two of a kind,

284
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:08,086
you know that?

285
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:11,319
You both just vanish
at the drop of a hat.

286
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:12,519
No getting around it.

287
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:14,786
We've got a bumpy
road ahead of us.

288
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,152
-Say what?

289
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:18,152
You can't lump me into the same
category as that screwball.

290
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,719
She's certifiably insane.

291
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:21,186
-Who we talking about?

292
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,686
-Oh, well, uh.

293
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:25,186
-This lady is one loose canon.

294
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,719
-Hey, good job securing
us a boat, by the way.

295
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:30,386
-Sensei, where in the
world have you been?

296
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,586
-Oh, just off gathering
a little information.

297
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,552
OK, is everybody ready?

298
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,986
-The shinobi of the
Leaf Village are here.

299
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,186
-The Land of the Sea must
have pleaded with them

300
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:44,419
to come take care of
the demon of the ocean.

301
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:47,419
-Well, we should give our new
guests a proper welcome then.

302
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,152
-It's getting dark.

303
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,819
-We'll be at the
island pretty soon.

304
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,452
Just a bit further.

305
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:57,686
-Sounds good to me.

306
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,352
Mother Island full
steam ahead, everybody.

307
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,752
-Sun's down, you know.

308
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,886
Seriously, where do you
get all your energy from?

309
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,552
-Yeah, well, at times like
this, your state of mind is key.

310
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,319
-Sakura's got her hands full.

311
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,886
I feel so bad for her.

312
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:21,281
-We've run up against
some rocks or something.

313
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:23,081
-Hang on, Naruto.

314
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:25,214
-Eyes front, guys,
we've got trouble.

315
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,214
Change course.

316
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:27,214
Hurry!

317
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,681
-Easier said than done.

318
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,681
-The oar is jammed.

319
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:34,281
-Let me help you.

320
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,347
-Striking shadow snake!

321
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:45,114
-Naruto, leave it.

322
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,914
-Right behind you.

323
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:48,614
-Huh.

324
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,547
Showing himself so soon.

325
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:58,214
-Man, that was a close call.

326
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,181
-Careful, you two.

327
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:01,381
We're being targeted
from underwater.

328
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,581
-Oh, boy.

329
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,847
Well, whatever this thing
is, an underwater battle

330
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,281
calls for an underwater expert.

331
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:09,481
Summoning jutsu.

332
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,247
I'm counting on you, Chief Toad.

333
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:15,714
You again?

334
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,014
-Geez, Louise.

335
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:19,781
What are you calling
me here for, kid?

336
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:22,181
-Hey, look, I'm not
happy to see you either.

337
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:22,847
OK.

338
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:23,947
-Hey, whoa, hang on.

339
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,714
-Summoning jutsu.

340
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:27,914
Come on, Chief.

341
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,314
-Hey there.

342
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:30,381
Evening--

343
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:31,947
-What the heck is
going on around here?

344
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:33,847
I called for the
chief, not a tadpole.

345
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,181
-Are you out of your gourd?

346
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,747
You can't summon pops out here.

347
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,114
It would be a disaster.

348
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:39,247
-How come?

349
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:41,481
-We're fresh water
creatures, genius.

350
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:43,681
Salt water and frogs don't mix.

351
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:46,214
-Actually, I don't
like anything salty.

352
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,314
-Ah!

353
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:51,681
Then what good are you
for crying out loud?

354
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,947
-Shino, you keep an eye on her.

355
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:58,347
All right.

356
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,281
Fire style dragon flame jutsu.

357
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:12,947
Water clone?

358
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:16,181
--[laughs] You let
your guard down.

359
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:17,547
-Yeah, so did you.

360
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,247
-Hurts, don't it?

361
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,547
-There was one more?

362
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,047
There was another one.

363
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,981
I'm losing strength.

364
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:34,047
--[laughs] I'm siphoning
off your chakra.

365
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,781
How does it feel?

366
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:38,147
-What's happening?

367
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,547
-Where did it go?

368
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:48,447
There's no visibility down here.

369
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,314
-Hey, come on, kid.

370
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,781
Pull yourself together.

371
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:59,714
-Big brother, I'm
itching all over.

372
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:03,214
-Yeah, I'm reaching
my limit here too.

373
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:06,147
-Big brother!

374
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:08,547
-Huh?

375
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:09,447
Oh, boy.

376
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:12,481
This ain't so good.

377
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:13,114
-Naruto.

378
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:14,647
-What's going on?

379
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:19,281
[laughter]

380
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:22,081
-Who are you?

381
00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:25,547
-Time to put all that chakra
I absorbed to good use.

382
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:27,747
Water style, furious
current jutsu.

383
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,081
-Ah, great.

384
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,181
That complicates things a bit.

385
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:38,795
-Naruto.

[music - chaba, "parade"]

387
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:05,469
-I can't believe the latest
shipment has been moved up.

388
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:06,636
-Never mind that now.

389
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,669
We have to find
Naruto by morning.

390
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:11,203
And hopefully learn more
about the demon of the ocean.

391
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,703
-It's a pretty big area
we have to search, though.

392
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:14,736
-We should split up.

393
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,569
-OK, then.

394
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,536
I'll head south.

395
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,603
You two take the north.

396
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:18,803
-Got it.

397
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,869
-This is something
new, you guys.

398
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:22,169
Tread carefully.

399
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:23,869
Let's move.

400
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,303
Next time, The Closed Door.
