2
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:03,865
NARUTO: No way.

3
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:04,865
What happened?

4
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,832
Where's Iruka-sensei?

5
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:09,699
-His scent tapers off here.

6
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:10,899
Well, come on.

7
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,232
We'd better start looking.

8
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:19,299
-I swear, if anything has
happened to you here, Sensei--

9
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,165
[sigh]

10
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,032
-Iruka-sensei!

11
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,932
Thank goodness you're OK!

12
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:33,099
-You're safe!

13
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:39,765
IRUKA: Somehow--
Mizuki was able to--

14
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:43,199
-Sensei-- you're injured.

15
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,265
-Don't worry.

16
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:47,432
I'll be just fine.

17
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:49,599
-Are you all right?

18
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:50,832
-I'm fine.

19
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:54,265
Just a little wave
of pain there.

20
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,532
-For someone coming.

21
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:57,432
-Huh?

22
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:57,932
-Huh?

23
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,132
TSUBAKI: The wound's not deep.

24
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,032
Thankfully.

25
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:10,799
-Yes.

26
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:13,632
NARUTO: Things got a little
heavy all of a sudden, huh?

27
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:15,332
PAKKUN: Hm.

28
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:18,732
Definitely something going
on between those two.

29
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,365
I'm guessing they're, uh--

30
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,365
NARUTO: Huh?

31
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,132
Why are you holding up your paw?

32
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,565
PAKKUN: You dummy, my pinky.

33
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,465
Look at my pinky.

34
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:26,965
-Your?

35
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,099
Pinky Huh?

36
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,565
Are you saying she's his--

37
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,565
PAKKUN: I'm a dog.

38
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,599
I pick up on these
things, you know?

39
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,465
-Naruto?

40
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,032
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:37,599
NARUTO: Oh!

42
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,899
Uh-- nothing!

43
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,099
Huh?

44
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:43,232
Anyway, let me introduce you.

45
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,632
I'd like you to meet Tsubaki.

46
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,632
She's Mizuki's fiance.

47
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,099
NARUTO: She's Mizu-- wait!

48
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:49,965
Fiance?

49
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,399
PAKKUN: My radar must be off.

50
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,632
NARUTO: Oh, you think?

51
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:57,265
-This is the second time
Mizuki has caused you trouble.

52
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,665
You have my sincerest
of apologies.

53
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,032
-So you know what's
going on then, don't you?

54
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,165
You're aware that Mizuki
broke out of prison.

55
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,265
-Yes.

56
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,499
The other day, he
came by my home.

57
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:17,832
I realized immediately
and tried to stop him.

58
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,532
But in the end, I
just let him go.

59
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,699
-One I have th Leaf
Village under my thumb!

60
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,965
IRUKA: But the way
he is now, there's

61
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,165
nothing you could have done.

62
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,732
TSUBAKI: No.

63
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:31,099
I should have tried
harder to stop him.

64
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:32,632
If you really loved me--

65
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:33,665
But I--

66
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,565
Give up this foolishness!

67
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:37,065
-Tsubaki.

68
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,832
[thud]

69
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:50,665
-Iruka, Naruto, I'm begging you.

70
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,965
You-- you have to
take me with you.

71
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,732
-Even though Mizuki--

72
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:59,965
-You probably think
I'm crazy for asking,

73
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,732
but this path he's on--
no matter what happens,

74
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,799
I have to stop him.

75
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:07,065
-Iruka-sensei!

76
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,532
-Tsubaki, I can understand
how you must feel now.

77
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,532
-So then--

78
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,965
-I'm sorry.

79
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,532
I can't allow it.

80
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,532
-Huh?

81
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,499
-But why?

82
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:23,265
-How come she
can't come with us?

83
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,599
-Naruto, look.

84
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,865
There's no time to waste.

85
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,265
We have to find Mizuki.

86
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,165
You must understand.

87
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,832
She would only hinder us
from completing our mission.

88
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,732
-Yeah, but she-- she--

89
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,399
-Iruka, please.

90
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,099
If that's the case,
then I believe

91
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:39,599
I can be of service to you.

92
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,032
I'm pretty sure I know
where he's headed next,

93
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,499
and I can take you there.

94
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:47,099
-Is that really true, Tsubaki?

95
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,065
-Yes.

96
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,565
I'm almost certain.

97
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,132
-But--

98
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,832
-I beg of you!

99
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:54,899
I know Mizuki.

100
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:59,465
He has a thousand ways
to cover his tracks.

101
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,465
If you waste your time
searching for him,

102
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,232
it will all be too late!

103
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,932
Please, take me with you!

104
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:29,865
-Hey.

105
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,465
About formula nara number 23.

106
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,199
-What were the results?

107
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,199
-The ninja herb
creeping saxifrag--

108
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:35,999
-Huh?

109
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:38,199
-Who the devil are you?

110
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,632
[shout]

111
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:45,599
-Tatsutori inu.

112
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,599
MAN: The sentries
have all taken out.

113
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:07,099
An intruder!

114
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:17,932
TSUNADE: What?

115
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:22,099
The Nara clan's research
lab came under attack?

116
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:23,432
-Yes ma'am.

117
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:26,465
We just received a dispatch
from them a short while ago.

118
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,965
According to this, the
insurgent's physical

119
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,799
characteristics match
those of Mizuki's.

120
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:32,632
TSUNADE: Mizuki's?

121
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,532
-Yes, ma'am.

122
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:38,699
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): What
is that Naruto doing?

123
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:42,765
-It was a clever move targeting
the Nara clan's institute.

124
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:46,232
Not only is there a bundle
of narcotics stored on-site,

125
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,032
there's practically no
security, since it's

126
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:49,265
holed up in the mountains.

127
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,432
What was stolen, then?

128
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,699
-Well, the Nara go
to great lengths

129
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:56,065
to keep track of every
substance they use.

130
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,465
They were able to determine
what was missing immediately.

131
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,332
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
So, they do match.

132
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:08,399
But even if he's running
around with these ingredients,

133
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:12,532
what would a mere Chunin
be able to do with them?

134
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:14,765
-Oh, uh, good work.

135
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,999
Thank you.

136
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:16,532
That's all.

137
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:17,099
You can go.

138
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:17,599
MAN: Yes ma'am.

139
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,165
-Well, I'm not
taking any chances.

140
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,132
There's not a whole
lot I can do until I've

141
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,999
figured out what
his objective is.

142
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:32,932
Even if the materials
don't tell me,

143
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:36,265
there may still be a way of
getting to the bottom of this.

144
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,365
Perhaps the proportions of
the formula, or the order

145
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,399
in which they're blended.

146
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:48,499
PAKKU: You're sure
this is the way, right?

147
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:49,599
TSUBAKI: Yes.

148
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,099
We just have to keep
going in this direction.

149
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,065
IRUKA: Tsubaki, you
said before we'd

150
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,265
be too late if we
didn't catch Mizuki.

151
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,899
Does that mean you know
what his objective is?

152
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:00,265
-Probably.

153
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,465
Not everything, but--

154
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,599
NARUTO: You have to tell us
anything you can, Tsubaki.

155
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:09,465
He only talks about
one thing now.

156
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:12,299
He wishes to seek out
Orochimaru and get his hands

157
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:14,699
on the Sannin's power.

158
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:15,965
-Are you kidding me?

159
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:21,899
TSUBAKI: The whole reason he
wanted to Scroll of Sealing

160
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:27,965
back then was to give it to
Orochimaru as an offering.

161
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:31,799
-Tsbuaki, you knew of this?

162
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,865
TSUBAKI: I never
told the village.

163
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,832
Just removing the Scroll of
Sealing is a serious crime.

164
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,599
And I was terrified
of what would happen

165
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:43,832
if his real objective
came to light.

166
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:47,932
I was sure he would abandon
the idea, mend his ways.

167
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:51,665
PAKKUN: Then you yourself
are not free from blame.

168
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,932
-I'm prepared to be judged.

169
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,732
IRUKA: There's something
I still don't understand.

170
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,199
If you knew where
Mizuki was going,

171
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,799
you could have gone
after him on your own.

172
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:05,032
But instead, you-- you--

173
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:06,732
-I don't want to go alone.

174
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:08,332
I might not be able to stop him.

175
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:14,699
His sins-- his sins
are far too many now.

176
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:18,032
I can't allow it to
go on any longer.

177
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:24,699
-So, Orochimaru, this is
the web you're weaving?

178
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:29,332
Although, it's not something an
average shinobi could pull off.

179
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:33,199
A technique like this could
only be executed by a master.

180
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,399
[knocking]

181
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,099
-I'm busy now.

182
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:39,165
MAN: I have an update for
you on the prison break.

183
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,365
-Very well, then.

184
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,032
Enter.

185
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:45,699
MAN: Yes, ma'am.

186
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,699
-We've just finished rounding
up the inmates, Lady Hokage.

187
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,165
They're all accounted for,
with the exception of three.

188
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,832
Mizuki, Fujin, and Raijin.

189
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,932
-Good work.

190
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,965
-The investigation
is still ongoing.

191
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,165
We're trying to track
them down at the moment.

192
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:06,365
And actually, one of
the men we captured

193
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,065
said something that has
me concerned, ma'am.

194
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,332
-Concerned?

195
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:14,632
-Yes.

196
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:19,299
Apparently he saw the three
men running off together.

197
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:22,399
-Fjun and Raijin
fleeing with Mizuki?

198
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:22,965
Oh, hell!

199
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,299
-Lady Tsunade?

200
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:29,499
-I'm heading out.

201
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:31,232
-Wh-- Where are you going?

202
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:32,999
-There's no need
for you to come.

203
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:36,532
If what this man says is
true, the team I sent out

204
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,965
won't be able to handle
this situation on their own.

205
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,732
-We can't keep this up forever.

206
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:57,732
If we don't think of something,
we're gonna be in trouble!

207
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,732
-We're already in trouble.

208
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,799
-Shikamaru.

209
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,699
I'll be out of chakra
in a second here.

210
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,699
-Yeah, I know.

211
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:07,699
I've gone over
every angle trying

212
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:11,165
to work out a decent strategy,
but if I let go of these ogres,

213
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,465
we're gonna find ourselves
in a lot of hot water.

214
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,132
-You little brat!

215
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,532
-We're no match for them
once they break free.

216
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:21,165
Otherwise, I'd have
let them loose by now.

217
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,865
-You're dead meat!

218
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:27,232
-The stamina these guys
possess is monstrous.

219
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:29,965
-And even though they look
like 50 tons of blubber,

220
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,332
it's all muscle, which
means they're probably

221
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:35,699
faster than they
appear to be, too.

222
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:39,732
-In other words, all we can do
now is keep these guys tied up.

223
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:42,565
-Then we'll just have
to keep at it, huh?

224
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,232
-Afraid so.

225
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:14,825
-What do you think, Mizuki?

226
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,258
-It's no good.

227
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,591
He can't go on.

228
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,825
He's done.

229
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,258
-I see.

230
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:24,925
All right, then.

231
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,325
Let's withdraw.

232
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,958
Hurry.

233
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:28,591
-I'm coming.

234
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:37,658
It's unfortunate, but those who
are no use on the battlefield

235
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,691
only become dead
weight for the rest.

236
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,058
It may just be a minor
injury but if you aren't able

237
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:45,125
to get up and fight--

238
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,625
[wicked laughter]

239
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,125
-What was that?

240
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:58,991
Is this some kind of
genjutsu, or paralysis?

241
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,491
OROCHIMARU: I saw you.

242
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:06,791
MIZUKI: It-- it can't be.

243
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:10,991
You're-- you're Orochimaru.

244
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,458
-Right you are.

245
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:14,591
MIZUKI: This is impossible.

246
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,025
What are you doing here?

247
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,825
You were supposed
to have vanished.

248
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,658
-Why I'm here is of
little consequence.

249
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,758
More important, I think,
is that bit of business

250
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,458
I witnessed earlier.

251
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,758
MIZUKI: Huh?

252
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,158
-You took the life of your
injured comrade, didn't you?

253
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:33,125
MIZUKI: You were watching?

254
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,658
-That piqued my curiosity.

255
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:39,291
It's not a sight one sees very
often among the Leaf shinobi,

256
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:41,125
who seem to devote all
their time to playing

257
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:43,191
ninja in the village.

258
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:46,758
-So, what are you-- what
are you trying to say?

259
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,791
I-- I didn't do anything wrong.

260
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:52,458
It was the only choice I had!

261
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,325
-You're a short tempered
child, aren't you?

262
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,225
It wasn't a reproach.

263
00:14:57,258 --> 00:15:00,058
You were merely carrying
out your mission.

264
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:02,691
-That's right.

265
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:06,925
-And yet, I highly doubt
anyone in the Leaf village

266
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,758
would acknowledge you for that.

267
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,491
Am I right?

268
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,258
-What have you done?

269
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,525
[chanting]

270
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:22,558
MIZUKI: What's happening?

271
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,525
-Consider this my gift to you.

272
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,491
You'll seek it out
when you are ready.

273
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,858
-This is it.

274
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:31,991
[boom]

275
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,391
-Looks like I'm the first
person to find this place.

276
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:58,758
The eighth one on the right.

277
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:18,991
Huh?

278
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,058
What's happening?

279
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:48,791
-What sort of power does
he seek from that madman?

280
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,258
-I wish that I could tell you.

281
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,458
I'm not even sure when he
crossed paths with Orochimaru.

282
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,025
But I'm positive those
answers lie ahead of us.

283
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:05,291
You must be angry, Naruto, for
what Mizuki did to you back

284
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,391
then.

285
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,458
NARUTO: I couldn't care
less at this point.

286
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,558
I gave that jerk what he had
coming right there on the spot.

287
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,091
What's done is done.

288
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,125
But--

289
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,391
-But what?

290
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:19,525
-If he's still got himself
mixed up with Orochimaru,

291
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,425
then I have something
I need to ask the guy,

292
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,991
because there's
somebody I have to find,

293
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,058
and no one's going
to stand in my way.

294
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:29,491
Sasuke.

295
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,391
-It's up ahead of us!

296
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,858
-Then let's get going!

297
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:00,791
-That's everything.

298
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,025
With this--

299
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:24,991
[wicked laughter]

300
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:32,225
-With this I'll achieve
total perfection!

301
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,625
Huh?

302
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,758
NARUTO: This place is--

303
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,825
[sniff]

304
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:40,158
-Oh, that guy is up
to no good in there.

305
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:43,258
The smell on the wind around
here is giving me the creeps.

306
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,625
-The smell?

307
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:47,925
[wicked laughter]

308
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,925
MIZUKI: I was
wondering who that was.

309
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,658
You guys sure are
persistent, huh?

310
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,425
This is perfect.

311
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,591
I was going to take
you down, anyway.

312
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,325
Now's my chance.

313
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:00,725
-Mizuki.

314
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,125
-You lousy--

315
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:03,558
-Mizuki!

316
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:06,325
Your twisted ambitions end here.

317
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,825
-Pompous as ever, eh, Iruka?

318
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,758
Too little, too late, though.

319
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,091
Same as always.

320
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,125
-What is that?

321
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,458
-Beautiful, isn't it?

322
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:24,225
-Oh, no!

323
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:27,891
-You know, you pathetic
ingrates should consider

324
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:31,458
it an honor to be my first prey.

325
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:34,791
[groan]

326
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,325
-What on earth?

327
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,191
-Mizuki!

328
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:46,025
-That's almost the same as--

329
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:50,325
-But you're not leaving me a
lot of choice here, Naruto.

330
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:03,458
There's no question
that you're special.

331
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,358
Unfortunately--

332
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,091
-So this is what he was after.

333
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,525
-Orochimaru's curse mark?

334
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:16,991
-Mizuki.

IRUKA: The ultimate body?

337
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:05,714
What do you mean?

338
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:09,147
How far are you willing to
go in this quest for power?

339
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,714
These formulas
you're dabbling in.

340
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,781
It's-- it's not
real power at all.

341
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:13,747
NARUTO: Ha!

342
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:16,014
Iruka-sensei is
right on the money.

343
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,647
So, this is one of
Orochimaru's tricks, huh?

344
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:21,314
Well, I'm putting an end to you
and your fancy little formula

345
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:23,714
right here and now!

346
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,281
Next time, A Clash of Fate!

347
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:27,381
You Can't Bring Me Down.
