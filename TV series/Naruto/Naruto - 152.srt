00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,423
RAIGA: Why?

4
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:07,590
He was such a good man.

5
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:08,690
Truly.

6
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:11,356
Why did he have
to be taken away?

7
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,290
Sorrow.

8
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:14,123
Such sorrow.

9
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,656
[sobbing] I remember
a day you showed me

10
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,090
one of your most
prized possessions.

11
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:35,023
[muffled screaming]

12
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,723
-With a twinkle in
your eye, you told me

13
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,423
how it had once
belonged to your father.

14
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:41,456
It was a beautiful piece.

15
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,923
A gorgeous pipebox.

16
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,423
No wonder you were
so proud of it.

17
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,523
Yet when I ripped
it from your hands

18
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:52,923
and smashed it to the ground,
all you did was laugh.

19
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:55,790
And when we booted you in
the ribs and tossed you in

20
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,690
you only smiled.

21
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:00,490
It was such a lovely smile.

22
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:03,423
Beautiful!

23
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,890
-Hold it in, Rokusuke.

24
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,690
They'll be gone in a minute.

25
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,723
This is our chance
to sneak away.

26
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,723
We've only got one shot.

27
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:11,756
-I know.

28
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,390
But Kanpachi--

29
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:16,223
-For our people, we
can't just sit idly by.

30
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:17,790
That village is our only hope.

31
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,723
We've no choice.

32
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:31,256
-Ah.

33
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,956
Nothing like a good funeral!

34
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:38,556
I can't wait till the next one.

35
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,823
[sigh]

36
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:47,723
RANMARU: One, two, three.

37
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:51,123
Another three have gotten away.

38
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,923
RAIGA: One more funeral
to look forward to.

40
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,356
-Where am I?

41
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,456
-The Hidden Leaf Village.

42
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,056
-Who are you?

43
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,190
-Naruto Uzumaki.

44
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:26,090
And I'm right in the
middle of some training.

45
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:29,023
-The Hidden Leaf?

46
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:29,556
Huh?

47
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,456
Hey, You OK?

48
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,356
Hang in there, buddy.

49
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,856
I gotcha.

50
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:40,956
Guess I can chalk this up
under training as well.

51
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:05,623
[grunting]

52
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,623
-I could do better.

53

ANKO: Lord Chichiasu
of the Land of Swamps

without a hitch.

55
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:23,123
-Good to know.

56
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,090
-Hey!

57
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,056
Tsunade was eating that!

58
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,856
[eating sounds]

59
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,190
-Man, the dumplings in
this village can't be beat.

60
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,556
-Anko, you just
took the last one.

61
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,156
-Mission accomplished, my lady.

62
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,623
I laid the smackdown on the
dastardly pirates of the Kitani

63
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:48,523
Channel with my
frenzied fists of love!

64
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,623
If they take this opportunity
to start their lives anew,

65
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:54,190
then the beautiful green
beast of the Leaf Village

66
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,790
will shed a tear!

67
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,190
[laughter]

68
00:05:58,223 --> 00:05:59,723
-You know what I'm saying?

69
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:03,990
[laughter]

70
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:07,156
-I have something I want
to put your squad on.

71
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,290
-Huh?

72
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:09,356
[sigh]

73
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,690
--We're stretched
thin enough as it is.

74
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:14,756
And yet somehow Naruto
has brought in more work.

75
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,823
-And remember, Guy.

76
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:17,490
One of our clients
already asked for you

77
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:20,323
specifically for that
one S-rank mission.

78
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:23,390
He'll have to set out today if
he wants to make it on time.

79
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,256
-They won't need Guy then.

80
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,156
-The day has finally come.

81
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,323
-Your kids will go.

82
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,090
Alone.

83
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,990
Neji, Tenten, and Lee.

84
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:34,690
-You won't regret this either.

85
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:35,990
My students will nail this one.

86
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:37,390
Believe you me.

87
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:41,790
-Also Naruto is going with them.

88
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,056
-What's that about?

89
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,290
Listen.

90
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:45,690
I love those kids more than
anything in this world,

91
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:47,756
but I'm telling you
that they can handle it!

92
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,423
Why can't they go alone?

93
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,123
-Look.

94
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:50,890
Just because.

95
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:51,490
All right?

96
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:59,723
[door opens and closes]

97
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,423
TSUNADE: Those men
Naruto rescued are here

98
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,256
to request our services.

99
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,223
They came all the way from
the Katabami gold mine,

100
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:09,623
one of the most abundant mines
in all the Land of Rivers.

101
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:11,756
But about six
months ago, a bunch

102
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,156
of goons calling themselves
the Kurosuke family

103
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,356
showed up and ran the
magistrate out of town.

104
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,056
They've taken over their
village and apparently are

105
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,923
killing people left and right.

106
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:24,256
-That is unforgivable.

107
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,890
TSUNADE: Once these men have
regained their strength,

108
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:30,056
your objective is to escort
them back to the Katabami Mine

109
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,590
And take out this
Kurosuke Family.

110
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,223
A simple mission really.

111
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:38,756
They're probably just a pack
of money-grubbing hoodlums.

112
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,223
-So what am I doing here?

113
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,090
It sounds like a chimp
could do this mission.

114
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:47,156
-Who the heck do
you think you are?

115
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,023
-Come on, grandma.

116
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,890
I've got enough on my plate now.

117
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:52,390
With training and
looking for Sasuke--

118
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:54,456
-You think you get to call
the shots around here,

119
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,323
you pipsqueak?

120
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,390
You're a genin.

121
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,223
You'll take whatever
mission I give you!

122
00:07:58,256 --> 00:07:59,723
I'll send you back
to the Academy

123
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,190
so fast you head'll spin.

124
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:01,856
[grumble]

125
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,356
-Neji Hyuga!

126
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,323
-Yes.

127
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,523
-You're team leader!

128
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:09,190
It'll be good training for you
trying to tame the untameable.

129
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,623
-I'd rather not.

130
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,290
But I'll give it a go.

131
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,090
-I'll be out training
when you need me.

132
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,556
The old bat.

133
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,056
-Naruto.

134
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,990
-Um-- sorry about that.

135
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,623
They have no manners, you know?

136
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:27,956
[awkward laughing]

137
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,790
-Uh-- wait up, you guys.

138
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:35,556
[groaning]

139
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,556
-Ow!

140
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,456
-Those lousy little brats!

141
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,190
What the heck do they think
I'm running here anyway?

142
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,023
GUY: Milady, if I may.

143
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,023
-What is it?

144
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,890
-The Kurosuke Family.

145
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,623
What did you say their
boss's name was again?

146
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:49,356
-Raiga.

147
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,156
-As I thought.

148
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,090
-What do you mean?

149
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,290
-Well, I heard a
rumor about him when

150
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:56,356
I was in the field one time.

151
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,656
-Huh?

152
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,823
-What kind of rumor?

153
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:01,523
-Still no sign of
Pervy Sage, and now I'm

154
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:03,690
stuck with some
lame-ass mission.

155
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,123
Man, this bites!

156
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,156
Hey!

157
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,023
Sakura!

158
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:09,823
-Naruto.

159
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,690
-What're you doing out here?

160
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:12,190
Huh?

161
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:13,556
A bird?

162
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,923
-Yeah.

163
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:17,423
I found it yesterday and I've
been trying to treat it but--

164
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:31,723
-Wow.

165
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,156
Sakura, that's amazing!

166
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,556
-But the poor little thing.

167
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,190
It got separated
from its friends.

168
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,490
-Naruto.

169
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,756
Uh-- sorry.

170
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,223
Am I intruding?

171
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,123
-Well, what does it look like?

172
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:54,956
-No, Lee.

173
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,856
Hold fast.

174
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,190
You must not turn away.

175
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,390
In our youth with must
always seize the moment.

176
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,590
Hey, Sakura.

177
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:03,223
How are you today?

178
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:04,356
-I'm great, Lee.

179
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,690
-What do you want already?

180
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:07,390
-A word with you, actually.

181
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:08,523
-Huh?

182
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:09,490
-See you later, Sakura.

183
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:10,423
-Could have been worse.

184
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,190
Least it wasn't a desk.

185
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:13,856
-You're hilarious,
you know that?

186
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,907
NARUTO: Say what?

187
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,907
The Kurosuke boss is
one of the Seven Ninja

188
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,241
Swordsmen of the Mist?

189
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:27,474
-That is right.

190
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:28,707
Guy-sensei filled me in.

191
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:32,474
And if he says it,
you know it is true.

192
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,541
-So who are these
sword dudes anyway?

193
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:36,607
-Naruto!

194
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,174
You said you fought
in the Land of Waves

195
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,174
on one of your missions.

196
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:39,841
Remember?

197
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:40,807
Back then.

198
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:44,774
-Oh yeah!

199
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:45,741
Zabuza.

200
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:47,141
And?

201
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:49,474
-And let us not forget that man
our senseis fought together--

202
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,974
Kisame Hoshigaki.

203
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:56,174
Word around the village is
you also a run-in with him.

204
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:56,974
-Oh right.

205
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:57,807
That guy.

206
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,041
I forgot about him.

207
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:00,841
-Both men hailed from
the Land of Mist,

208
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:04,207
and both are former members
of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen

209
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:04,941
as well.

210
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:06,574
And Kisame had a partner.

211
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:10,041
He was not alone.

212
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:10,541
-Ah.

213
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:11,107
Yeah.

214
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,874
That Itachi guy.

215
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,174
And?

216
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,007
-Do you not get it yet?

217
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,674
This Raiga, if he is indeed one
of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen,

218
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:21,907
will probably have some
connection to Itachi

219
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,607
who seems to be in
league with Kisame now.

220
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,907
-Oh.

221
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:26,741
And?

222
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:29,841
-And who is Itachi linked to?

223
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:30,307
-Oh!

224
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,141
I know!

225
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,074
It's Sasuke!

226
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,574
-That is right, Naruto!

227
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,574
That gold mine is
the perfect place

228
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,141
to pick up Sasuke's trail again.

229
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:39,141
Am I right?

230
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:39,841
-Yeah.

231
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:41,141
I don't know.

232
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:43,174
If Guy told you then--

233
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:44,141
-Hey!

234
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:46,541
Do not disparage
my sensei, Naruto.

235
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:48,841
That info is totally reliable.

236
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,541
110%.

237
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:51,041
-Mhm.

238
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:54,707
NEJI: All right.

239
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:55,974
We keep a close
eye on our friends

240
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,374
here as we head
for Katabami, then

241
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:01,407
deal with the Kurosuke
Family once we arrive.

242
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:04,374
LEE: There is a shop that is
very close to that village.

243
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,607
It can be our home base.

244
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,907
-Why do you know about
a shop out there.

245
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:09,841
-Sorry.

246
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:12,441
That is a surprise
for the journey.

247
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:15,307
-We're just waiting on
Naruto then, naturally.

248
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:18,207
-Well this whole mission is
based on info from Guy-sensei.

249
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:19,907
Maybe Naruto just didn't buy it.

250
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,874
-That is not true, Tenten.

251
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,841
He will definitely be here.

252
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:27,841
Naruto knows Guy-sensei's
intel is rock solid.

253
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,641
-Terrific.

254
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:30,507
-Huh?

255
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,741
-Here I am!

256
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:34,407
So, we're all here.

257
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,174
Let's hit the road, everybody.

258
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,441
-That's not your call.

259
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:41,941
-Let's do it!

260
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,341
Hey-- uh-- which way is it?

261
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,474
-Calm down, Rokusuke.

262
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:14,707
It's gonna be OK.

263
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:16,374
These shinobi will
save our village.

264
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,441
-Heh heh.

265
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:24,841
Nothing like a little
post-meal training.

266
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:26,441
I will no allow myself to lose!

267
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:30,741
Hiya!

268
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:36,974
-Well, I'm not losing either.

269
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:38,807
[laughter]

270
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:41,841
-How long do you ninja
plan on resting here?

271
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,107
-Huh?

272
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:46,141
-We need to keep moving if
we want to save Kanpachi.

273
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:47,541
-Have you gone mad?

274
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:48,641
Come on.

275
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:50,774
You know how long he's
been in that coffin.

276
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:51,741
It's hard but--

277
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:03,374
-This grogginess-- I remember.

278
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,974
Must be close.

279
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:06,007
Grogginess?

280
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,774
Are you sleepwalking right now?

281
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,007
-Do not worry.

282
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,741
I ran a marathon here one time.

283
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:14,474
It was three days and I slept
through the whole thing.

284
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:15,807
-You're pulling my leg.

285
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:16,341
-No.

286
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:17,241
It is true.

287
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,074
Guy-sensei and I
raced one another.

288
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:23,407
My body aches just
thinking about it.

289
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,974
I am so sleepy.

290
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:26,341
-Hey, uh-- bushy brow.

291
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:27,441
Are you sure you're OK?

292
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,841
-Hah.

293
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:31,874
I almost forgot how thick the
scent of curry is around here.

294
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,307
It is so spicy.

295
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:34,807
-Curry?

296
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,541
Oh yeah.

297
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:38,407
-I was right!

298
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,274
It is just up ahead!

299
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:41,907
The Curry Shop of Life!

300
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:48,874
LEE: Grandma Sansho!

301
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:49,374
-Wait.

302
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,007
Is that?

303
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:50,774
Well, goodness me!

304
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,674
LEE: Long time no see!

305
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,041
-Oh, my, my, my, my!

306
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,507
-I told you I would
return one day!

307
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,374
-So, um-- this is
Lee's shop then?

308
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,974
-Hm.

309
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,474
-That mountain is the
Katabami gold mine.

310
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:02,974
-Huh?

311
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,341
-Grandma Sansho's curry
saved my life back then.

312
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:15,374
NARUTO: Huh?

313
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,641
You just mean it's
good though, right?

314
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:18,441
-No.

315
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:19,974
It obviously saved my life.

316
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,641
I am in its debt.

317
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:24,907
This was back in the days when
I had just become a genin.

318
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,174
Guy-sensei had brought
me out to these parts

319
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:29,274
to introduce a new
training regimen.

320
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:29,741
-Oh.

321
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:30,707
Of course.

322
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,007
I remember.

323
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,474
That brings me back.

324
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:38,274
-Come on, Lee.

325
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,074
Give it your all.

326
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,774
[panting]

327
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,141
-Oh, my.

328
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,507
-Ah, hey.

329
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,807
Grandma Sansho, how'd you do?

330
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,407
-Why, there're back again.

331
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:50,907
-Huh?

332
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,774
-Those gentlemen are
running in their sleep!

333
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:08,941
-Karashi, if you had the kind
of energy those boys have,

334
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:11,074
you'd never lose to those
rotten bullies again.

335
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,141
[footsteps]

336
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,141
-Oh dear.

337
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:18,507
Me and my big mouth.

338
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:28,207
-Huh?

339
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:41,507
GRANDMA: Gracious.

340
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,407
This is the third day.

341
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:44,941
And they've never
stopped running.

342
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,207
Ah!

343
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,207
One of them's down!

344
00:16:58,174 --> 00:16:59,107
-Easy now.

345
00:16:59,141 --> 00:16:59,574
Easy.

346
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,907
[snoring]

347
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,707
-I wonder if he's hungry.

348
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,774
Yeah Oh.

349
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:17,974
What a pickle.

350
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:20,107
He still won't wake up.

351
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:21,907
Perhaps it needs
a bit more spice.

352
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:38,907
Karashi.

353
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:45,074
-I've never seen
anyone work so hard.

354
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,241
-I see.

355
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,041
So you want to help this
young man as well, eh?

356
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:09,507
[scream]

357
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,207
LEE: This is the
courage of life.

358
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:16,541
Now, Grandma Sansho
went to all the trouble

359
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,107
of making us this curry.

360
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,274
So let us dig in!

361
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,407
I cannot wait!

362
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:50,607
Delicious!

363
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,107
This is just so delectable!

364
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:52,807
Mm!

365
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:53,874
A myriad of flavors!

366
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:56,341
The spices are
blended to perfection.

367
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:59,274
Plus, whatever these little hard
chunks are, they're amazing!

368
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:13,607
[screaming]

369
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:16,974
LEE: So good.

370
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:19,007
Oh, by the way, where's
Karashi right now?

371
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:19,741
Is he out?

372
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:20,874
-Oh.

373
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:24,007
Well, the boy was very
moved by your work ethic

374
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,141
and began attacking life
with quite a new vigor.

375
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:31,607
So much, in fact, that he left
the shop and set out for town.

376
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,507
I shouldn't have
pushed him so much.

377
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,974
Always telling him to be strong.

378
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,841
I'm going to be a man, he said.

379
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,674
Part of the Kurosuke Family.

380
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:42,507
-Huh?

381
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,707
-Hm?

382
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:44,574
-Oh.

383
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,407
Please.

384
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,041
You mustn't worry yourself son.

385
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:48,941
I'm not blaming you.

386
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:50,441
-Too late now.

387
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:52,441
-I am responsible for this.

388
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:52,941
-Oh.

389
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,341
Dear me.

390
00:19:54,374 --> 00:19:55,474
-Neji!

391
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,407
Request to incorporate
the rescue of Karashi

392
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,774
into our mission.

393
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:01,541
We will bring him back from
this road of evil he has taken!

394
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:06,541
NEJI: Very well.

395
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:14,307
We'll use the shop as
a base of operations,

396
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,274
and start scouting the village.

397
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:19,007
Then we can come up with a
strategy and make our move.

398
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:19,507
-Roger.

399
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:24,207
NEJI: You three had
better stay behind here.

400
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:26,707
If we face the
Kurosuke Family things

401
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:28,441
will definitely get dicey.

402
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,407
HACHIDAI: This is terrible!

403
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,474
Rokusuke!

404
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:38,007
He's-- he's-- he's gone!

405
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,541
-He must have gone
into town alone.

406
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,941
The blasted fool!

407
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,307
-That spells trouble.

408
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,741
Neji, if those guys
find him then--

409
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,541
-Too late trying to map out a
strategy at this point, guys.

410
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:56,507
-We better get
straight to business.

411
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,607
-Right.

412
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:59,007
Let us get to business.

413
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:02,974
NEJI: Let's hurry.

414
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,841
ROKUSUKE (VOICEOVER):
Just hold on, Kanpachi.

415
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:10,107
I won't abandon you.

416
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,341
RANMARU: Someone is coming.

417
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:20,341
RAIGA: What a pity.

418
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:22,641
Seems we'll be holding
yet another funeral.

419
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:33,198
[theme music]

420
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,998
LEE: You should have
told me that day.

421
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:06,232
If you put enough care
into your cooking,

422
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:10,298
even a single serving of curry
can save a person's life.

423
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:12,432
With enough hard work
and effort nothing

424
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:15,298
is impossible, even
for someone like me.

425
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:17,565
I've always believed that.

426
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,832
You were far more admirable
when I first met you, Karashi.

427
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:25,765
And yet-- Next time--
A Lesson Learned.

428
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:26,965
The Iron Fist of Love.
