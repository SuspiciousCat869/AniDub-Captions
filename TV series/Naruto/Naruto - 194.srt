Lady Chiyo and her attendants

my better points are?

-You idiot.

170
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,045
Paintings don't move.

171
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,618
Stop being such
a wuss, will you?

172
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:30,620
-Hey.

173
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,557
This table is set
for seven people.

174
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,494
-What's so special about that?

175
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,166
-Well, the party that went
missing from the Land of Honey

176
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,638
had seven people in it.

177
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,241
Which means the Lady
and her attendants

178
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,512
could be somewhere
in this castle.

179
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,050
Why don't we split
up and look for them?

-Huh?

181
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,155
What do you want
to split up for?

182
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,560
No reason to break up a
perfectly good team, right,

183
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,997

You don't have to be
such a bully about it.

I know, OK?

Man, I am not cut out for this.

00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:19,985
I can barely handle going to

"Kubisaki Castle-- it
happened 50 years ago.

With the castle

our people were
brutally slaughtered.

And the few lowly samurai
holed up within these walls

held little hope of
seeing another nightfall.

My thirst for vengeance lives on
in every stone of this castle.

I've actually seen something
like this once before.

00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:12,146
Inside the stomach of a giant
toad the pervy sage summoned.

KIBA: Inside its stomach?

So wait a minute.

323
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:18,593
Does that mean this
smell is stomach acid?

324
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,529
HINATA: Koza Kubisaki
invoked the art

325
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:23,135
of summoning before
his stronghold fell.

326
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,874
And whatever he called
forth was big enough

327
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,412
to swallow the place whole.

328
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:31,017
And the moment we set
foot inside the castle,

329
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,388
we were gobbled up, too.

-I don't get it.

331
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,927
Why would he tell his
pet castle to eat us

332
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,396
like some sort of snack?

333
