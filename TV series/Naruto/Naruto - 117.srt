Huh?

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,504
What?

-(VOICEOVER) Just barely.

10
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:33,570
That was close, but I
was able to throw it

11
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:35,337
off course a little.

12
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,004
There's no mistake.

13
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:40,237
He's caught on to the
secret of the Byakugan.

-(VOICEOVER) Huh?

I see-- that chakra.

23
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,737
All this time, he's been
releasing a steady flow

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,004
and surrounding himself with it.

25
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,304
And such a wide range.

26
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:16,404
It's no wonder he
sensed the arrow coming.

27
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:20,970
He was able to throw
off its trajectory.

[laughing]

29
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,170
It's got to be
killing him to keep

30
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,804
expending chakra on that level.

31
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:32,270
But if he doesn't keep it up,
he won't be able to dodge.

32
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,870
There's no doubt about it.

33
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,604
It's just as I thought.

34
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:41,204
My arrow was totally
invisible to him.

-(VOICEOVER) He makes
no pointless attacks.

37
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:47,670
He's been culling
information with every move.

[groaning]

39
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,837
And he's discovered the
weakness behind my eyes.

40
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,970
Impressive.

41

[groaning]

42
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,370
He's the strongest

43
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:15,470
-(VOICEOVER) He's got
360 degrees of vision.

44
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:18,737
He can sense all attacks
within a 50 meter radius.

45
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,304
But for some reason,
he wasn't able to evade

46
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:28,370
a few of the kunai.

47
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:31,937
Why couldn't he evade them?

48
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,970
Of course!

49
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,004
Because he couldn't see them!

50
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:40,837
Or rather, his seemingly
perfect jutsu has a blind spot.

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,404
So if one of those kunai
hits that blind spot,

52
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,770
he can't react.

53
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:49,604
That's what that other jutsu
was for-- to compensate

54
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,937
for the blind spot
in his defense.

attacks and fully grasp

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,104
the implications
of their outcome.

58
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:01,970
He has a blind spot
immolating from a small point

59
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:04,737
just behind the first
thoracic vertebra.

64

As long as he keeps
that blind spot moving,

65
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,637
it will be hard to sling
an arrow down its path.

66
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,737
That's not enough to stop me!

67
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,637
The gentle fist
is useless if you

68

can't get close to your enemy.

you struggle or not.

00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:22,212
So don't come whining to
me with this destiny stuff.

170
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:25,879
And stop trying to tell me
you can't change what you are.

171
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,346
You can do it, too.

172
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,879
Because after all, unlike
me, you're not a failure.

just the three of us left now.

00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,646
-I don't think you have
to worry about that.

177
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,946
Choji and Neji are going
to catch up in no time!

178
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,546
Choji's got his
trump card with him.

179
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,779
And don't forget-- I fought Neji
in the Chunin exam, so I know.

180
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,712
-You know what?

181
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:03,346
-That guy is a true genius.

But how?

199
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,712
You should be dead!

200
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,579
Why are you still alive?

201
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:22,746
-I couldn't have
evaded you anyway.

202
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,146
So I decided to take
the hit deliberately.

203
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:30,212
And I know my weakness
much better than you do.

204
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:33,779
(VOICEOVER) Hm.

205
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,779
There were eight birds.

206
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:39,546
The Byakugan does
have a blind spot.

207
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:43,046
But knowing the direction
your strike was coming from,

208
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,579
I could release chakra
just to that one point

209
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:48,912
and watch for your attack.

210
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:51,646
Moving just a few inches
to evade the worst

211
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,246
was no great feat.

212
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,912
I'm seriously hurt.

213
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:57,279
But I'm still alive.

-So you did it on purpose, huh?

217
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:07,412
Knowing you were going
to die here anyway.

218
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,746
Why would you go that far?

219
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:16,846
-You are the strongest
enemy I have ever fought.

220
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,046
But there is a reason
why I cannot lose.

221
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:27,812
Once-- not so long ago-- the
strongest person I ever fought

222
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,212
out of everyone said to me--

[coughing]

You can do do it, too.

225
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:38,879
Because after all, unlike
me, you're not a failure.

226
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,846
Those were his words.

227
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:47,312
All this time I've been called
a genius, so I cannot lose.

228
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,012
I can't let down those
who believe in me.

The weakest one in the game
always goes down first.

Try all you want.

There's no way you can stop it.

It's too late.

-Naruto, sometimes your eyes
are even better than mine.

260

There's someone who can
find him in the darkness.

261
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,312
And save him from this path.

KIDOMARU: Huh.

00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,979
Sasuke belongs to
Lord Orochimaru now.
