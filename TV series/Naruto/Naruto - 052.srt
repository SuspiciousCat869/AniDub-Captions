Are you kidding me?

-Naruto, this is a
hospital, keep it down.

NARUTO: Boy, am I
glad to see you.

12
00:01:58,195 --> 00:01:59,697
I gotta ask you a favor.

-Stop right there.

I already know what
you're going to ask.

So I've been looking
for someone that

can oversee your training
for the final rounds.

-Hold on!

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,276
Why can't you train me, Sensei?

19
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,478
-I have other matters to handle.

20

deal with you, Naruto.

Aha!

You're going to train Sasuke
aren't you, Kakashi Sensei.

-Now, now, don't complain.

better teacher than me.

Of all the guys you
could've picked,

40

you pick this guy to train me?

What a joke!

I'll make you a deal.

you want to eat.

I will always be haunted
by that humiliation.

why it has to be him?

If it hadn't been for Kakashi,
who asked me this favor,

00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,757
I would never
consider training you.

two, let's calm down.

Listen, Naruto, you're
wrong about Ebisu Sensei.

75
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,033
He's a special jonin.

76
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,103
A private tutor, who
only trains the elite.

77

Frankly, he's a better
teacher than I am.

-Aww.

79
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,979
-Anyway, Naruto, I've got to
say that of the three genin

80
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,283
in Squad 7, you're the one
whose basic skills need the most

81
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:30,550
work.

82
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:33,287
That's what I want you to
focus on this time around.

83
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,920
-Wait!

84
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,088
Hold on a second!

85
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,089
Are you honestly
saying that I'm not

86
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:39,526
as good as Sasuke or Sakura?

87

[sighs]

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,897
-Naruto, no matter how
many skills you master,

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,501
the fundamentals are,
well, fundamental and yours

90
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,969
could be improved.

91
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,638
So if you really want to
become strong then just

92
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,909
be quiet and pay attention.

93
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:59,646
All right, Ebisu Sensei, I
leave him in your capable hands.

It's for your own good.

98
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:10,324
Just do your best.

99
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,561
-Well, come on.

100
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:15,362
Let's get started.

101
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:21,068
-OK but I don't buy it.

102
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,002
-Huh?

103
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,571
-This whole thing
is totally nuts!

104
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:26,841
Even if I do need to work on
my fundamentals, how the heck

105
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,308
are they supposed
to get better when

106
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,578
I've got a teacher who's
weaker at this stuff than I am?

107
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,382
-I beg your pardon but who do
you think you're calling weak?

108
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,350
-You do you think?

109
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:36,717
Who else is standing here!

110
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,219
-If this is all because of that
ridiculous and inappropriate

111
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,357
jutsu of yours, it took me
by surprise, that's all.

112
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,992
I wouldn't be too hasty to
judge my abilities based

113
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,362
on one incident a long time ago.

114
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:52,233
-Just 'cause you ended up flat
on your back and out cold.

115
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:56,271
-All right, then, let's
put it to a test, shall we?

116
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,038
-Huh?

117
00:05:57,072 --> 00:06:00,075
-Naruto, try and run away.

118
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,209
-Huh?

119
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,377
-I mean it.

120
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,145
I want you to try running
as fast as you can.

121
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:07,482
If you can get away from you,
I'll resign as your trainer.

122
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:08,749
-Is that a promise?

123
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,886
-Certainly, and
what's more, since I

124
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,520
know how much you
prefer Kakashi,

125
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:15,490
I think I can arrange to take
over enough of his other duties

126
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,158
so that he can be your trainer.

127
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:17,625
-Yeah?

128
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,927
Really?

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,228
-Of course.

130
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:22,597
An elite jonin never
goes back on his word.

131
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,334
But it's all contingent on
you being able to out run me.

132
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,770
-Man, this is the easiest
deal I've ever made.

133
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,205
So long, sucker!

Eat my dust, you closet perv.

137
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,321
I'll send you a postcard.

138
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,329
Ha!

139
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,263
Lost him!

140
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:55,931
I guess now that
old sour puss will

141
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,600
have to admit he's dealing
with an exceptional ninja.

If that's the best you can do,
we might as well stop right now

145

and save us both some time.

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,080
-Yeah?

147
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,448
Well, not so fast.

148
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:13,282
Just wait.

be a grumpy old stiff,

you're doing, Naruto?

It was a good idea actually,
just not good enough.

00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:41,671
Well, what are you waiting for?

167
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:45,542
Catch us if you can.

168
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:48,245
-Again, not bad.

169
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,981
However, you're not
the only one who

170
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:53,550
can perform the Shadow
Clone jutsu, my friend.

171
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:58,789
You can't get away.

172
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,260
-Not again!

173
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,569
That does it!

174
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,537
I've had enough of you!

176
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,322
-All right, that's one down.

177
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,193
That's two down.

178
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,905
I've got you now!

180
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:51,943
-Where do you
think you're going?

181
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:52,911
Ha!

182
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:53,878
Got you.

183
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,414
Hold it right there.

184
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:57,215
You don't.

185
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,850
I don't think so!

186
00:09:58,883 --> 00:09:59,751
Take that!

187
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:01,853
And that!

188
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,255
[panting]

189
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,062
-Well, had enough?

190
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:12,597
[screams]

191
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,270
-Man!

192
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:20,605
You're a real pain,
you know that?

193
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,541
Why can't you just go
away and leave me alone!

194
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:24,776
-It wouldn't be much of
a chase if I did that.

195
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,714
I'm supposed to be trying
to catch you, remember?

196
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:31,483
-He's got a point.

197
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:34,085
-So Naruto, I hope
you have a better

198
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,087
opinion of my abilities now.

199
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,623
If you've had enough,
let's begin your training.

200
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:39,324
-Yeah, right.

201
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,227
Stick it in your ear.

202
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,563
I'm still going to get
rid of you somehow.

203
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:48,500
Kakashi is the only
one I'll let train me.

204
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:52,271
Either he trains
me or no one does!

205
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,606
-I see the river hasn't
cooled off your spirit.

206
00:10:58,877 --> 00:10:59,811
Look at him.

207
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:01,280
He's turned the tables.

208
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:04,516
Instead of trying to escape,
he's coming right at me.

209
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,787
Well, Kakashi always said he was
an unpredictable knuckleheaded

210
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,188
ninja.

211
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:11,356
-Time I gave you some training!

212
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,127
Huh?

213
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,729
It was a clone?

214
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:32,311
-Sorry Naruto.

215
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,913
This game is over.

216
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,176
-Rats!

217
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,924
WAITRESS: One plain
ramen and one miso ramen

218
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:48,127
with barbecue pork.

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,796
MAN: There you go.

220
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,132
EBISU: Now, Naruto,
having had a chance

221
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,501
to observe your
technique firsthand

222
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:58,604
and going off what Kakashi
told me, it's clear to me

223
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:03,243
that one of your weakest
points is chakra control.

224
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,844
-Chakra control?

225
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:06,446
-Exactly.

226
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,614
When we compare your abilities
in this department with those

227
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,351
of your teammates,
Sakura and Sasuke,

228
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:14,387
your deficiency becomes obvious.

229
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,657
As you may know, in order to
successfully perform ninjutsu,

230
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,594
genjutsu, and the like, a ninja
must first build up his chakra.

231
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:22,528
-Yeah.

232
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:25,098
Like you said, I
already know that.

233
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:26,599
-I would hope so.

234
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:29,169
Well, then, let's compare
you to your teammates

235
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,704
in this department
and perhaps you'll

236
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:34,307
begin to see just how inferior
your abilities really are.

237
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,743
-You've got an annoying
way of putting things.

238
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:41,548
-As agreed, I'm buying you lunch
so just be quiet and listen.

239
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:46,252
First, let's examine how Sakura
prepares for a clone jutsu.

240
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,621
-Clone jutsu.

241
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:54,260
-She's perfect at building up
her chakra to its full extent

242
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,262
and because she's
so efficient, she

243
00:12:56,296 --> 00:13:01,167
can make clones without
wasting any excess energy.

244
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,838
And for Sasuke, it must be said
he's not nearly as efficient

245
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:09,109
when it comes to building
up a full supply of chakra.

246
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,043
-Clone jutsu.

247
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,817
-But you see, his
control over the chakra

248
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,786
itself is so flawless that
he has no problem producing

249
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,823
five clones as
easily as Sakura can.

250
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:25,592
So the result is the
same, even if Sasuke

251
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,962
does waste more chakra
in getting there.

252
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:30,397
-What do you know and I
thought Sasuke was perfect

253
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,432
in everything.

254
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,967
-Wipe that smile off your face.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,170
You are in no position to
make fun of anyone else.

256
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:38,072
-Why?

257
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:41,275
-You are no good at building up
your chakra or controlling it.

258
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,344
The result being you
require much more

259
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:46,080
chakra to produce to any clones.

260
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:47,348
NARUTO: What the?

261
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,617
EBISU: You have to
exert much more effort.

262
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,854
And even then, after all the
effort and wasting much more

263
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,356
chakra than either
Sakura or Sasuke.

264
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:57,825
-Clone jutsu.

265
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:00,628
-You can barely produce
two clones at best.

266
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:04,966
In fact, using the
same amount of chakra

267
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:08,503
you use, Sakura and Sasuke
could come up with 10 clones.

268
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,110
You see how the three of you
have very different levels

269
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:18,079
of ability just
on this one jutsu?

270
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,784
Oh well, I may have
been exaggerating

271
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,919
a bit in my comparison,
but the bottom line

272
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:27,622
is you waste too much of
your strength, Naruto,

273
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,324
and build up too much chakra.

274
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,426
You need to learn some
control, that's all.

275
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:32,727
-Yeah, well if
I'm such a lame-o,

276
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,429
how come there have
been times when

277
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,697
I've done better than they have?

278
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,265
-That's not the same thing.

279
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,701
That's only because you have
reserves of energy and stamina

280
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,003
that are hardly even human.

281
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,707
EBISU (VOICEOVER):
After all, how

282
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,577
can I expect him to have control
when he has the nine-tailed fox

283
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,047
spirits chakra
sealed within him.

284
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:58,020
The point is, we both know
you are strong, Naruto,

285
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,421
but you could be
so much stronger

286
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,223
if you'd let me show you how.

287
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:01,957
-Really?

288
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,125
You mean it?

289
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:05,160
-I not only mean
it, I guarantee it.

290
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:07,095
Now if you're
ready, let's begin.

291
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:09,031
MAN: Sir, your bill.

292
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,633
-Oh, I forgot.

293
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,673

297
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:33,121
-OK, you mind explaining
why you've dragged me

298
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:34,657
up here to these hot springs?

299
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,692
Is a bath part of my training?

300
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,328
Not that I'd mind soaking
my feet after that hike--

301
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:40,729
-Naruto!

302

Where do you think you're going?

That's the women's bath.

I will not allow any

NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
Disreputable behavior.

00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,774
What's he talking about?

308

to sneak a peek.

Huh.

310
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:58,481
From what I know about him, he's
the real pervert around here.

311

-What is it?

312
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,152
What's that look?

313
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:03,987
-Oh, nothing.

314
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,088
Nothing.

315
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,691
Anyway, what in the
world are we doing here?

316
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:10,593
Are you going to train me
how to wash behind my ears?

317
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:14,964
-Not quite, but you're right,
it is part of your training.

318
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:15,564
-Huh?

319
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:19,536
-Right here.

320
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:20,904
This is the place.

00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:21,638
-A bath?

00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,372
OK, what's going on?

-Don't take that tone with me.

324
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:28,011
Like I told you before, this
is all part of your training.

325
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,647

try taking it from the top.

326

What am I training for again?

327
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,419
[chortles]

328
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,922
-I'm going to teach you
how to walk on water.

329
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:39,523
-Huh?

330
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:44,060
-What is it now?

331
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:47,797
-Do you seriously expect me
to believe that you really

332
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,466
know how to walk on water?

333
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:52,469
-Of course I do!

334
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,838
According to what
Kakashi told me,

335
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,406
you've already
been trained in how

336
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,109
to climb a tree without
using your hands, right?

337
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,411
This is a variation of that.

338
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,579
-I don't know.

339
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,014
That was a long time ago.

340
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,850
I'm not so good at remembering
stuff that far back.

341
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,853
-Well, in tree
climbing, the key is

342
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:11,055
to build up chakra in
the points of contact

343
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:14,324
and then to maintain at a
steady rate of discharge.

344
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,693
Of course, trees are
stationary objects

345
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:19,897
so the discharge rate
remains constant.

346
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,499
All the same, it's
an excellent exercise

347
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,135
for developing basic
chakra control.

348
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,872
Now, to walk on water, you not
only have to build up chakra

349
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:31,041
at the points of contact, you
must also constantly adjust

350
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:33,778
the rate of discharge in
order to maintain your balance

351
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,481
on the water's shifting surface.

352
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,948
-Mmm hmm.

353
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:39,550
-This is obviously more
difficult than just maintaining

354
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,619
a fixed flow of chakra.

355
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:43,754
But that's what chakra
control is all about,

356
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:46,991
being able to discharge it at
a steady aura to varying rate.

357
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,193
You understand?

358
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,961
-I wish I did.

359
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,932
-Well, perhaps it would be
easier if I just showed you.

360
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:59,337
First, built up chakra in
the soles of your feet.

361
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,105
Then carefully
calibrating the amount

362
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,975
you discharge from each foot in
order to maintain your balance.

363
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,648
There, you see?

364
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,250
That's how it's done.

365
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,652
-Cool!

366
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,854
OK, let me give it a try now.

367
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,959
First, build up
chakra in your feet.

368
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:24,762
And then calibrating
a whatever it is.

369
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:26,131
Ah!

370
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,132
-Not quite.

371
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,634
[screams]

372
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,503
-Oh, by the way, don't
forget it's a hot spring.

373
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:34,840
You don't want to keep
falling in like that.

374
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,075
You'll be boiled like a lobster.

375
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,544
-Very funny.

376
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,079
NARUTO (VOICEOVER):
I can do this.

377
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:45,283
I got it now!

378
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,291
[splash]

379
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,793
Hot, hot, hot!

380
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:00,131
EBISU (VOICEOVER): Well, you
seem unusually diligent today,

381
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:00,732
Konahamaru.

382
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:04,736
Excellent.

383
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,039
It looks like my guidance
is finally paying off.

384
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,409
Isn't it about time you're
launching another surprise

385
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,844
attack against Lord Hokage?

386
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,181
-Naw, I don't do that
kind of thing anymore.

387
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:16,582
-That's astounding.

388
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,250
Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

389
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:20,919
So you understand that the
shortcut to becoming Hokage

390
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,155
is to do exactly as I say.

391
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,992
-Well, there aren't
any shortcuts here.

392
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:28,427
-Huh?

393
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,097
-Naruto told me that.

394
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,267
He said I had to learn that
if I ever wanted to be Hokage.

395
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,475
-Whoa.

396
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:46,545
I'm actually
starting to get this.

397
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,047
EBISU (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

398
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,248
He's right.

399
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,918
To think that he's already
started to master it.

400
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:56,088
I never imagined that he
would have come so far.

401
00:19:56,122 --> 00:20:00,092
Indeed, there are no
shortcuts in anything.

402
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,629
Perhaps you were a better
teacher to Konahamaru

403
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:03,863
than I was.

404
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:07,066
It seems I was wrong
about you, Naruto.

405
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,837
There is more within
you than a demon spirit.

406
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,240
There is the heart of a splendid
Hidden Leaf Village ninja.

407
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,976
-Ahh!

408
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,646
[splash]

409
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,781
[laughter]

410
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:30,089
-Are you peeking in the
women's bath, old man?

411
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:32,192
I'm will not allow any
disreputable behavior.

412
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:37,998
-Oh please.

413
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:38,565
-Huh?

414
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,334
What on earth?

415
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:42,902
What are you doing?

416
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:55,515
-What's wrong with you?

417
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,784
Keep it down.

418
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:59,586
Do you want to get
us busted, you idiot?

419
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,555
-Huh?

420
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:03,924
Who is this guy?

421
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,293
He flattened my trainer.

422
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:10,430
And what's worse, he's an
even bigger perv than Ebisu.

423
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,935
[laughter]

424
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:22,164
[music playing]

425
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,156
NARUTO: I don't know
who he is, but no one

426
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:55,525
interrupts by training
and gets away with it.

427
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,028
Especially not some
perv in a fright wig,

428
00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:59,595
riding a giant bull frog.

429
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,965
Guess I'll just have
to train on him.

430
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:06,336
Only thing is, I wish he
wasn't quite so fast or strong.

431
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,005
What is this guy, a super ninja?

432
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,930
Next time.

433
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:12,396
"Long Time No See,
Jiraiya Returns."

434
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,996
Oh, brother.

435
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,196
Again with the girls.

436
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,930
Can't anyone around here
keep his mind on the job?
