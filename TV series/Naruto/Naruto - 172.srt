00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,108
-Which way?

3
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,077
How do we get out?

4
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,744
-This way!

5
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:10,451
I think I can smell the sea!

6
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:15,759
-Ugh, we're so close!

7
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:19,499
-No sweat, I'll fire up my
Razen gun and blast us out!

8
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,801
-No way!

9
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,771
You're liable to bring the whole
mountain down on our heads!

10
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,107
-OK, fine.

11
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,110
You got any better ideas?

12
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:26,678
-Watch out.

13
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,180
Everybody stand back!

14
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:46,377
-Ah, fresh air!

15
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,080
What a relief!

16
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:50,484
-Uncle Sensei,
are you all right?

17
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:51,285
-Let's go.

18
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,454
There's no time to waste.

19
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:53,790
It's already morning.

20
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,192
-Oh, right!

21
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,761
-The fleet is
sailing into a trap!

22
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,433
-Yeah, we've gotta reach'em
before it's too late!

23
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,169
-Hey!

24
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,103
How about that boat?

25
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:02,638
-Right!

26
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:03,539
Get on board.

27
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,850
-Still no word from
the Leaf Ninja?

28
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:13,189
They were expected to
accompany the fleet into port.

29
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,791
What could've happened to them?

30
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,260
-Yeah

31
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,894
-Captain!

32
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,465
Sir, we just received this!

33
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:26,644
-Hmm-- Well, well, we were
wrong to have ever doubted them.

34
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:29,181
They drove the demon of the
ocean out of these waters

35
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:29,883
last night!

36
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,552
Ohh!

37
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,654
Wonderful!

38
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:35,124
At last, we know the
fleet will be safe, sir.

39
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:38,731
-All hands, hoist the
anchor and make sail!

40
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:39,732
Let's put to sea!

-Be sure to steer
clear of the reef!

43
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,399
-Huh?

44
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,871
I don't see a fleet in the
harbor, or any ships at all!

45
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,674
-There's only one
reason they ever

46
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:06,912
would have left without us.

47
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,146
It's Hamachi.

48
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,384
He laid a trap, and
they fell for it.

49
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,842
-(ON RADIO) Captain Hitone!

50
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,145
-What's the matter?

51
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,914
-There's something down
there-- below the ship.

52
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:29,590
It's aaaagh!

53
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:42,670
-The reef!

54
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:44,173
Hard to port.

55
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:44,908
-Yes, sir.

56
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,182
-It can't be!

57
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:55,592
-I said hard to port!

58
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:57,261
-She's not responding, sir.

59
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,530
-What are you talking about?

60
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:15,525
Can't watch it.

61
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,328
It's no use.

62
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:18,497
We're gonna hit.

63
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,266
All hands brace for impact!

64
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,933
-Must be the demon's doing.

65
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,469
-[evil laughter]

66
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:43,872
-Thank you for
delivering the fleet.

67
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:45,910
But what's going on here?

68
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,451
Who are you?

69
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,353
And what do you want?

70
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,923
-This fleet and in its cargo.

71
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:56,894
Hand it over peacefully,
and I'll spare your life.

72
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:59,833
-You're outta your mind!

73
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,368
-Aaah!

74
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:01,851
Ugh!

75
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:09,381
-Ehhh Aaaah!

76
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,350
-It's a monster!

77
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:11,786
-A demon of the ocean!

78
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:12,386
-Aaaah!

79
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,370
-Demon illusion, fire jutsu!

80
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:25,742
-Ah!

81
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,011
What is that?

82
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:28,247
-It's coming right at us!

83
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:37,929
[screaming]

84
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:41,469
[evil laughter]

85
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:51,953
-Now, finish them off, will you?

86
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,535
-Whoa!

87
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,486
-Ugh!

88
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,465
-I'm the one you
have to face now.

89
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,806
-It's all right!

90
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,440
I've got you.

91
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,477
Hang on!

92
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,018
-Man, that's really low,
even by your standards.

93
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,288
Weirdo.

94
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:34,624
Glad you showed up.

95
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,827
I've still got a few
questions I want answered.

96
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,895
-Mmm

97
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:40,700
-Isaribi, what are you doing?

98
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,536
Don't you understand by now?

99
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,545
Keep acting like this, and
you really will be a monster!

100
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,981
-Isaribi, get him!

101
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,068
-I'm the one you've
gotta worry about.

102
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:04,540
You said Orochimatu left
the research lab weeks ago.

103
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,410
Isn't that right?

104
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,413
Any clue where he's been since?

105
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,550
-I have no idea.

106
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,055
I know he took a young kid with
him, an excellent prospect,

107
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:14,557
he said.

108
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,463
This kid isn't going to be a
disappointment, like you were.

109
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:20,767
-Saskarachia.

110
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,804
-You just didn't quite have it.

111
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,707
Guess that's why he
tossed you aside.

112
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,854
Isaribi!

113
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:33,455
Oh!

114
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,862
Jenaclo jutsu!

115
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:26,376
Isaribia what do I have to
do so-- so you'll understand.

116
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:29,080
You're putting people's
lives in jeopardy.

117
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:32,987
Isaribi, don't you
care about them at all?

118
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:34,790
-Since you asked, no.

119
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,959
-Huh?

120
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,565
-See, their lives
mean nothing to me.

121
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:42,636
Yours means nothing to me.

122
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,039
-You know that's a lie!

123
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,525
-Do you think I
care who gets hurt?

124
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:57,828
Who drowns?

125
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,565
-There's only one
thing I care about,

126
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,635
and that's being returned
to the way I was!

127
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,780
It's about time
somebody woke you up!

128
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,832
Believe me, I know.

129
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,737
I know just how
painful it can be.

130
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,075
But still, that doesn't make
it right to hurt others!

131
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:18,763
-You saved my life!

132
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:20,099
Have you forgotten that?

133
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:21,801
You have a good heart, Isaribi.

134
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:22,703
You do care!

135
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:48,479
-Heh, not bad for
a medical ninja.

136
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,019
-So glad you approve.

137
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,755
-You're losing your focus.

138
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,756
That is a mistake!

139
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,106
-Now, I've done it!

140
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:07,678
-Ha!

141
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:08,714
Someone was a little
overconfident.

142
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:13,488
-You're useless!

143
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:17,160
What the devil's taking so long?

144
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,563
-Hamachi

145
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,665
-He's only a kid.

146
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,903
How hard could it be
to finish him off?

147
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:24,039
-I'm sorry.

148
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:24,706
It's just--

149
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,475
-Be quiet!

150
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:26,844
I'll do it.

151
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,882
-That suits me fine, because
you're the real monster.

152
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,918
It'll be a pleasure
walloping you!

153
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,588
-What did you call me?

154
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:34,690
A monster?

155
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:35,792
-Yeah, you hear right!

156
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,528
Anyone who could cause
so much destruction

157
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,533
and laugh it off like it was
nothing-- don't fool yourself!

158
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,236
You're a monster in human skin!

159
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,848
What's so funny, now?

160
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,787
-You've seen right through
me, but no half monster

161
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:53,688
like Isaribi.

162
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,525
I'm the complete package.

163
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,492
-Huh?

164
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:56,960
-You wanna see?

165
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:12,719
-I am the fully-refined model,
perfected for mortal combat.

166
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,957
-Why, you--!

167
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:15,958
-But Hamachi--

168
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,895
-Out of the way!

169
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,098
I don't have any more
need for a guinea pig.

170
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:25,808
-Whataya think you're doin'?

171
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:26,777
Just leave her alone!

172
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,213
-We were planning
to dissect her,

173
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,883
and harvest her organs
for experiments.

174
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,821
But then we took pity on
her, and let her live.

175
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,059
And what did we get for our
trouble, but incompetence

176
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:36,726
and ingratitude!

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,536
What's the matter?

178
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:44,172
Feeling nervous?

179
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,674
-Grrrrr!

180
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,010
You wish!

181
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,615
Calling you a monster's
giving you too much credit!

182
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:53,788
Mister, you're so disgusting,
you make pond scum look good!

183
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:54,256
-Ha!

184
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:55,858
How impolite.

185
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,160
Come here, and say that!

186
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:59,565
-You bet I will!

187
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:00,132
-So long!

188
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,580
-Heh, that all you've got?

189
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:12,185
-Not even close!

190
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,721
-Multi-jenaclo jutsu!

191
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,739
-It doesn't matter how
many you throw at me!

192
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,218
-What's this?

193
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:32,853
Done already?

194
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,566
Nah, give it another try.

195
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,936
-Yeah, you'd better believe it!

196
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,810
And until you turn Isaribi back,
I'm gonna keep comin' at ya

197
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,279
again and again, and again!

198
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,616
-Water-style great
cannonball jutsu!

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,302
-So whataya say?

200
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,070
Had enough?

201
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:06,776
Come on, already.

202
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,747
Give it up, kid!

203
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:17,661
-I already told you-- until
you make Isaribi human again,

204
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,798
I'm never gonna give up!

205
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:22,302
I'll keep comin' at
you over and over!

206
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,094
-For me?

207
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:39,130
You'd do that for my sake?

208
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,674
-I'm getting a little
bored of this farce.

209
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:46,643
Come!

210
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:47,611
Sea monster!

211
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:56,626
Sea monster, finish him off!

212
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:07,778
-Hey!

213
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:08,680
Hey, whataya--?

214
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:17,661
-The Sea Monster body
consists entirely of water.

215
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,664
It's almost like a moving
water prison jutsu.

216
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:32,418
-I've gotta do something.

217
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:39,364
Haaaa!

218
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,369
Ugh!

219
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,905
Didn't work.

220
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,340
-Of course, not.

221
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:47,076
Did you really think it would?

222
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:49,181
Finish them off, Isaribi!

223
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:53,420
That's right, I'll give
you another chance.

224
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:54,756
Go on!

225
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,091
Don't you want to
be human again?

226
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,668
What's the matter?

227
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,904
You know I'm the only one
who can turn you back.

228
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,280
Well then, go on, do as I say.

229
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:13,854
NARUTO: It's no good.

230
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:22,703
It won't make it right.

231
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:24,105
Don't do it, Isaribi.

232
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:27,877
Please don't go there into
that world-- into the darkness.

233
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,921
-Aaaaaah!

234
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:20,280
Aaaaaah!

235
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,177
-What's happening?

236
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,079
What type of chakra is that?

237
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,856
No, it's not possible!

238
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:40,373
-Aah!

239
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:40,899
Aaaah!

00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:56,191

00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:59,163
No!

242
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,099
There's no way!

243
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,568
I'm not gonna let
you take her there.

244
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,006
Y'got that?

245
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,108
-He's transformed, somehow.

246
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,478
But into what?

247
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:09,080
Aaaaaaaaaah!

248
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,057
-Naruto!

249
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,264
-That's right, he's
the same as you.

250
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:22,536
What are you talking
about-- the same as me?

251
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:26,208
-Yeah, Naruto carries
inside him the spirit

252
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:30,382
of the nine-tailed fox that
almost destroyed our village.

253
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,118
Ever since he was
a child, people

254
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:36,458
have treated him like
a monster, and a freak.

255
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:39,463
That's why he works and fights
twice as hard as anyone.

256
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,242
Every day's a struggle,
just to be accepted

257
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,978
by the world as a human being.

258
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,989
Believe me, I know.

259
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:58,562
I know just how
painful it can be.

260
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:02,435
But still, that doesn't make
it right to hurt others!

261
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:05,273
-What he told me--
it's completely true.

262
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,342
I see what he meant.

-No!
