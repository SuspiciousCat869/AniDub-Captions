102

-Well, actually,
the funny thing is

103
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,806
that I'm the one
who summoned you.

104
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,408
You see, I fell off
the cliff, and I

105
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:49,111
thought that maybe
you could rescue me.

There's no way a

could have enough power to
summon up a being like me.

It's true!

me and saying anything whatever

you want since you
first got here,

122
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,360
but I'm the one
who summoned you,

123
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,796
and that means I'm your master.

124
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,334
You have to start respecting
me and doing what I say.

125

You got that, Toad?

You've got some nerve.

Who do you think
you're talking to?

A meaningless little squirt
like you-- barely old

to Lord Gamabunta, the Chief
Toad, that you're his master?

me-- and trust me,

00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,795
What do you suppose
you're doing now?

170
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,364
-(ANGRILY) Fine.

171
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:52,003
If making you respect me depends
on me staying on your back,

172
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:55,342
well then-- I'll just make
sure I don't get off your back

173
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,746
the rest of the
day, no matter what.

174
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,748
-What?

175
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:00,351
-That's right.

176
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:03,155
And when I do, then you'll have
no choice but to recognize me

177
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,758
as your undisputed master!

178
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,029
-(ANGRILY) You
really are a snot!

179
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,966
Fine, if that's what you
want, but don't think

180
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,301
I'm going to go easy on you.

181
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:11,771
[screaming]

182
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:16,379
[screaming]

183
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:20,787
[screaming]

184
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,160
-Must grip with chakra!

185
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,763
I don't have enough chakra!

186
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,766
Listen carefully, Chief Toad.

187
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,770
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.

188
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,374
I'm going to become
Akagi someday.

189
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,378
Don't forget that!

190
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,181
[screaming]

191
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:38,786
-(YELLING) I don't care!

192
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:42,793
[screaming]

193
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,195
[laughing]

194
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:48,469
-This is getting
pretty interesting.

195
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:51,742
[women giggling]

196
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:52,877
-Huh?

197
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,578
WOMAN: (PLAYFULLY) Stop it!

198
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,580
[laughing]

199
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,816
WOMAN: (PLAYFULLY) Quit it!

200
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,353
-Sorry, Naruto, I'd
love to help you,

201
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:02,694
but I'm afraid that I've got
far too much work to do here.

202
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,462
[laughing]

203
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,698
Research.

204
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,469
Yes, research.

205
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:10,074
[laughing]

206
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,848
[yelling]

207
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,853
-(YELLING) Get off!

208
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,424
[yelling]

209
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,795
[screaming]

210
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,216
-Welcome.

211
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,318
Come on in.

212
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:38,523
-I am going to eat until
I can't eat no more!

213
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:39,725
-Ha.

214
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,362
Those guys are eating
barbecue again.

215
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:44,935
Giving themselves a reward
for training so hard, I guess.

216
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,740
-Hey, I thought you were
told not to let Gaara out

217
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:48,842
of your sight, Kankuro.

218
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,879
-Oh, don't worry.

219
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:53,717
Even someone like
him wouldn't dare

220
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,355
to do anything in
broad daylight.

221
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,227
But about you--
that guy, Shikamaru,

222
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,097
or whatever his name
is-- he's the first guy

223
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,533
you're fighting, right?

224
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,505
Shouldn't you be
formulating a battle plan?

225
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,908
-Huh.

226
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,678
There's no way that I would lose
to a guy who's at that level.

227
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:10,814
No way.

228
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:13,084
KANKURO: You blew
it, didn't you?

229
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,756
-If you had taken the
exam one year earlier,

230
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:20,397
then you would have made
Chunin easily, right, Temari?

231
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,199
-Don't say that.

232
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:27,009
What?

233
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,947
What did you just say?

234
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,983
-I'm going to have
you three ninja--

235
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,120
the best from the
Hidden Sand Village--

236
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,458
participate in the
upcoming Chunin exam.

237
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,428
But the reason that
I'm having you do so

238
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,400
is not for you to
pass the Chunin exam.

239
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,072
We must use this
chance so that we're

240
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:45,776
able to crush the
Hidden Leaf Village.

241
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,012
-But why?

242
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:49,148
Why are we turning
on the Leaf Village?

243
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,953
Didn't we signed the Treaty
of Alliance with them?

244
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,957
-Yes, we did.

245
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,896
And that treaty is
the whole problem.

246
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:57,698
-I don't get it.

247
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,200
What do you mean?

248
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:02,138
-You Genin aren't aware of
all the details of this,

249
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,342
but when the Treaty of
Alliance was signed,

250
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,282
that idiot feudal Lord who rules
us used it as an opportunity

251
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:11,989
to force military
cutbacks on our village.

252
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,560
He also delegated to
the Hidden Leaf Village

253
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,466
matters that should
have been handled by us.

254
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:21,105
And even worse, he significantly
cut our village's budget

255
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,276
and slashed the
number of Shinobi.

256
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,582
When the head of our country is
weak, we-- the country's arms

257
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,684
and legs-- suffer.

258
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,155
And so we took the only
choice left to us--

259
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,991
improve the quality
of every Shinobi

260
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:35,030
to maintain our
military strength.

261
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:42,377
That's why Shinobi like
you were created, Gaara.

262
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,346
The land of wind's
very existence

263
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,521
is in danger-- more danger
than it's ever been in before.

264
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,491
But still, that
idiot fuedal Lord

265
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:55,633
and all his incompetent advisers
are too blind to see it.

266
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,872
So the Kazekage who
detected this weakening

267
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,444
of the might of
the Sand Village,

268
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:03,580
joined hands with
the Sound Village

269
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:06,586
to show our feudal
Lord his stupidity

270
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,192
by crushing the Hidden Leaf
village and restoring our own.

271
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,263
This needs to be done
to make that idiot

272
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,235
aware of the importance
of preparing for a crisis!

273
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,711
If any more time
passes, our Sand Village

274
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,982
will be completely
drained of its ability

275
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,353
to fight against
the Leaf Village.

276
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,457
This is our only chance.

277
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,799
Now, Gaara, this mission depends
entirely upon your skills.

278
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,808
-Yes.

279
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:43,418
-This path will certainly lead
to war with the Leaf Village.

280
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,622
-We'll be-- we'll be
going to war again?

281
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:49,328
We've spent so much time
and sacrificed so much

282
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:53,836
to achieve this alliance,
and now we're breaking it.

283
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,139
So many will die.

284
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:57,042
-But-- but Temari--

285
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,144
-Harden your heart.

286
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:00,281
This is the will
of Lord Kazekage.

287
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,018
[gasping]

288
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,320
-Lord Kazekage?

289
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,559
All Shinobi are simply
tools for fighting.

290
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,098
Accept that fact, and you'll see
that all the Treaty of Alliance

291
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:13,071
does is nothing more than
jeopardize our very existence.

292
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,948
This is an A-plus
ranked mission.

293
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,751
Make sure you succeed.

294
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:23,088
-OK.

295
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,092
-Yes.

296
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,997
[yawning]

297
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,600
-I'm bored.

298
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:33,975
The day sure goes by slowly when
you're not doing much anything.

299
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:36,712
-I guess.

300
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,084
[screaming]

301
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,027
[screaming]

302
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:00,154
-Ugh.

303
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:01,023
What an obstinate little squirt.

304
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,112
[screaming]

305
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:23,963
[groaning]

306
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:24,765
JIRAIYA: Oh, dear.

307
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,800
Look at that.

308
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,036
Seems like Naruto is in agony.

309
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,009
[laughing]

310
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,914
He must have exhausted
most of his chakra

311
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:37,019
when he used that summoning
jutsu to bring Gamabunta here.

312
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:37,921
WOMAN: Ooh!

313
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:38,689
Look at that!

314
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:39,925
Isn't that rainbow pretty?

315
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:40,893
WOMAN: Yeah!

316
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,629
It's gorgeous!

317
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,332
-Oh, yeah, I'll say.

318
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,336
It's all gorgeous.

319
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:47,305
[giggling]

320
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:48,272
WOMEN: Ooh.

321
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:57,489
KAZEKAGE: Good work, Baki.

322
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,793
-Thank you, Lord Kazekage.

323
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,796
I successfully moved
all three pawns

324
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,568
to the final rounds as planned.

325
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,171
KAZEKAGE: Hm.

326
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:09,244
And the pact with the Sound
Village has progressed as well?

327
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:12,014
BAKI: Yes, sir.

328
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:16,623
This scroll contains the details
of the Sound Village's plan.

329
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,822
KAZEKAGE: Is there
something else?

-Yes, sir.

334
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,866
I was wondering if you
could position soldiers

pretext of a tactical exercise.

-The Hidden Leaf Village
isn't full of dimwits,

00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,950

Everything we've worked

-But with only our current
military capability--

-That's why I've sent
Gaara and the others.

The restoration of Sand Village

losing to him burns me up!
