-It's the weapon of
choice for assassinations.

101
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:24,320
The secret of the jab is
in the speed with which it

102
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,757
is delivered and
the ninja's ability

103
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,495
to focus his chakra at
the point of impact.

104
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,800
Once these two elements,
speed and focus,

105
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,937
have attained a certain
level, the chakra

give off the distinctive sound

that you hear--
like birds chirping.

the technique its name--

-Also known as Lightning Blade.

-Why's that?

118
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,606
-It got that name
because Kakashi once

119
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,509
used it to cut a
bold of lightning

could touch the ground.

-But whether called Thousand
Birds or Lightning Blade,

126
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,705
it's a technique of
unimaginable power,

requiring almost inhuman
levels of speed and chakra.

128
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:35,318
But once perfected, it
transforms a ninja's arm

into an indestructible
and invincible sword.

130

A dangerous technique,
not to be taught lightly.

ROCK LEE (VOICEOVER): I
understand it well enough.

137
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,962
Even with a running
start at top speed,

138
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:05,166
I would never use a
direct frontal attack

139
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,969
with a jab against my opponent.

140
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:12,378
Or rather, I could not.

141
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:15,382
I know that I would be opening
myself to a counterblow,

142
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,554
and I could not trust in
my ability to avoid it.

143
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:21,158
That requires a
keenness of instinct

144
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,964
that I just do not have.

145
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:28,537
In short, I envy you, Sasuke.

146
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,441
When we fought, I
told you it was not

147
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,079
enough to be able to
watch and imitate.

148
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:36,450
Understanding a
technique is useless

149

if you do not have the physical
ability to pull it off.

150
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,625
I felt so superior.

151
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,728
But now, you have
trained your body

152
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:47,200
to move at a speed that equals
or even surpasses my own.

153
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,740
And of course, you have
something else-- the Sharingan.

154

-Now I've got you.

-We're good here.

156
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,996
How about on your end?

157
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,131
-Everything's set.

00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:09,002
We're good to go at any time.

159
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:09,837
-Right.

Be ready to move at the signal.

wasn't strong enough.

166
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:40,019
Now he thinks he's too
strong, and he's jealous.

167
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,528
-Sasuke.

168
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,935
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): This is it.

169
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,845
NARUTO: Summoning Jutsu!

170
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,570
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): I've
worked to make myself stronger

171
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,275
so that I could become
Hokage, so that I

172
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:16,444
wouldn't lose to anyone.

173
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,181
NARUTO: Hey, Sasuke!

174
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:20,284
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): So that
I wouldn't lose to you.

175
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,790
-Don't lose.

176
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,427
Because I want to
fight you myself.

177
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,701
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): But
that was before I knew.

178
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:31,703
-Got it.

179
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,471
-What is this?

180
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,476
It's so warm and wet.

181
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,982
Mother, what is it?

182
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:11,901
[screaming]

183
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,370
Blood!

184
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:16,909
It's my blood!

185
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,011
-Wha-- what's happening?

186
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,598
[screaming]

187
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,567
TEMARI (VOICEOVER): Impossible.

188
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,303
Gaara in pain?

189
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,754
-What's that?

190
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:45,923
KANKURO (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

191
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:46,925
That arm.

192
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,942
-Gaara, you reckless
little fool!

193
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:04,920
Is that thing taking over again?

194
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,322
-I don't know.

195
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,292
This has never happened before.

196
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:09,627
I think he's hurt.

197
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,502
KANKURO (VOICEOVER):
Oh, I remember

198
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:17,440
the first time I
saw it, that thing.

199
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:22,582
It was awful, horrible.

200
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,518
Oh, man.

201
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,321
Oh, I couldn't eat for a week.

202
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:45,820
[growling]

203
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:10,826
-I sense something,
something bad.

204
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:51,826
-I was right.

205
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,529
He's hurt.

206
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,833
The shell broke before
the change was complete.

207
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,253
SASUKE (VOICEOVER):
Something's different.

208
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:11,491
That's not the same look in
his eyes that I saw before.

209
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,027
-Huh?

210
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,886
What's going on?

211
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,523
Everything's getting all fuzzy.

212
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:13,859
-Kakashi, do you feel it?

213
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:17,130
-Yeah, a genjutsu.

214
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:17,631
-Release!

215
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:33,857
-What the heck?

216
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,360
Uh-oh.

217
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:37,197
Release!

218
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,000
BAKI (VOICEOVER): Genjutsu.

219
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:42,338
So Kabuto's already
made his move, huh?

220
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,241
The time must be close.

221
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,251
-It's coming.

222
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,078
Now, shall we begin?

223
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,733
-There's the signal.

224
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,237
[music playing]

225
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,050
-The operation has begun.

226
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:39,678
[music playing]

227
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:16,269
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Oh,
well, I could use a nap.

228
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:18,172
Feels good.

229
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,707
Mattress is a little hard.

230
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,044
Hey, who's making all the noise?

231
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,080
Keep it down, would you?

232
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:24,448
I'm trying to sleep.

233
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:25,784
I hear voices.

234
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,252
Kakashi sensei?

235
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,421
Sasuke?

236
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:29,423
Oh, yeah.

237
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:30,592
Sasuke's match.

238
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,827
I should wake up.

239
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,162
Don't want to miss that.

240
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:34,937
Next time-- Zero Hour!

241
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:38,204
The Destruction of the
Hidden Leaf Village Begins!

242
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:41,004
Wake me up when it gets good.
