It's Lady Tsunade.

at the hospital, too?

to stay in the office.

you see Kurenai-sensei.

-Hey, you finally woke up!

00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,911
-So you're saying Mizuki
didn't know anything?

53
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:47,144
-Lady Tsunade even
interrogated him herself.

54
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,811
He didn't have any
information that

55
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,877
would lead to Orochimaru's
current whereabouts.

56
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,911
-So after all that trouble,
he was nothing more than one

57
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,977
of Orochimaru's pawns.

58
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,877
-So it would seem, yes.

59
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,411
-And we still don't
know where Sasuke is.

with Mizuki.

-That's got to be
killing Naruto right now.

-You're right.

67
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:21,477
And thanks to him, Tsunade
can't focus on any of her work.

68
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,377
Naruto's been breathing
down our neck,

00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,211
asking for permission to
go off in search of Sasuke.

70
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:29,344
She couldn't take it anymore and
snuck out of her office, but--

71
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:33,711
-Yeah, he was lying
here in wait for her.

you gonna make me ask?

Let me go out there
and look for Sasuke!

00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,177
-Oh, I don't know.

going to find him?

-Look, I'll figure it out, OK?

00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:01,744
If we're out of leads, I'll
just have to go dig some up.

keep you waiting!

00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:51,677
-OK.

109
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:59,702
-Have something
to drink as well.

110
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,369
-Thank you.

111
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,235
I will.

-It's a shame Hinata
wasn't able to stay.

113
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,502
It would have been good
for her to observe you.

114
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,435
-Then Hinata prepared this?

115
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,335
-It would be a help to the girl.

116
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,469
Watching you would likely
improve her own training.

I'd say you're getting closer
to perfecting the technique.

all to you guys.

It's so kind of you to help
me train like this every day.

When your comrade is in a

It's only natural.

133
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,335
[sighing] I imagine if
one of your comrades

134
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:24,269
is gone all of a sudden,
it must be awfully hard.

-Mmhmm.

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,035
Isn't there some
way we can help him?

138
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,069
-Yeah, I know.

139
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:36,069
I'd like to help him
out some way, too.

140
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:36,969
But--

141
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,469
[dog whining]

142
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:41,602
-You guys both heard what Lady
Tsunade told him yesterday.

143
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,169
Sasuke's trail's gone cold.

144
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,735
SHINO: Well, there is
one thing we can try.

145
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,235
-Yeah?

146
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,735
Like what?

147
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,335
The bikochu beetle.

148
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:57,569
-The bikochu beetle?

149
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,735
You're referring to the rare
breed of insect, correct?

150
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,669
From what I'm told,
they die off ages ago.

151
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:07,269
SHINO: When it became clear that
they were close to extinction

152
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,402
The Aburame Clan immediately
stopped using them

153
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,569
so that the remaining
few might survive.

154
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,269
-Lady Tsunade, what are
these beetles, exactly?

155
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,602
-To be honest, it's
no big surprise

156
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:20,535
that you haven't heard of them.

157
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,769
The bikochu haven't
been put into use

158
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,702
since before the last
of the great wars.

159
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:30,402
They're a species of beetle
used by insect handlers.

160
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,469
Once their larvae are
hatched, they quickly

161
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:37,135
move into the chrysalis phase
and emerge as full grown Imago.

162
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,935
They're then familiarized
with a specific scent

163
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,969
so that they can later track it.

164
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:44,302
No matter how faint
that scent has become,

165

their olfactory perception
is several times greater than

166

a ninja hound's.

167
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,902
Their usefulness in
espionage is hard to dismiss.

168
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:58,802
However, the bikochu only lay
eggs once every several years.

169
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:01,935
-It just so happens
that this is that year.

170
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:04,369
And this is the season
when they hatch.

171
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:05,702
-Well, whaddya know.

172
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,935
-And I'm betting Sasuke left
most of this stuff behind,

173
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,135
didn't he?

174
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,802
-If we expose one of these
beetles to his scent--

175
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,335
-Then it'll hopefully
lead us straight

176
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,769
to Sasuke's current location.

177
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:18,169
-Mmm.

178
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:21,569
-What's the probability
of finding one now?

179
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,335
-Frankly speaking,
not very high.

180
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,502
Maybe around 10%.

181
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:29,069
-A whopping 10%, huh?

the situation in the village is

00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,535
fairly grave at the moment.

185
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,169
I don't have the luxury of
letting my genin lounge around

and play.

However, fortunately or
unfortunately, Kurenai

down on that 10% chance.

-Shino Aburame, Kiba Inuzuka,
and Hinata Hyuga, your orders
