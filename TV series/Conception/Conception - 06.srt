doing labyrinth explorations.

158
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,208
So, I thought
letting them see a slice

159
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,208
of the Visitor's
everyday life might be

160
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,208
a kind of fun
and educational break for them.

161
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,250
Think of it
as cultural immersion.

162
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,666
Visitor,
can I have some bread?

163
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,125
Me, too, I'm hungry.

164
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,583
Can we, Visitor?

165
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,541
Yeah, feel free to eat
as much as you want.

166
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
[STAR CHILDREN]
Yay!

167
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,541
[ALFIE]
Let's see. Here you go.

168
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,833
-[ITSUKI] But...
-[ALFIE] You'll owe me one.

169
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,666
Sound good?

170
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,250
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you.

171
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,583
[COLLETTE] I don't even think
I can remember the last time

172
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,875
we had this many customers
in the shop!

173
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,041
Guess I'll just have to go
make more bread!

174
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,666
Tell me more about that,
would you?

175
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,708
Why do you think
you have no customers?

176
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,958
There has to be
a good reason.

177
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,416
[RED] Hey.
My, my, how long do you figure

178
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,125
you'll keep
doing business here?

179
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,125
[BLUE] I can't believe you're
still wasting time baking bread.

180
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,041
You know it'll just go stale
on the shelf.

181
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,208
Who the heck are you people?

182
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,791
Who are we?
Are you kidding?

183
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,458
I'm happy to tell you
if you don't know.

184
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,375
We are the number one most
successful bakery in the country

185
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,500
and the creators
of Lunch Packs.

186
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,833
[COLLETTE]
Lunch Packs.

187
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,625
[ITSUKI]
The ones we see all the time?

188
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,791
Yeah! Of course the ones
you see all the time!

189
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,875
Our company's been looking
for prospective land

190
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,166
for a new storefront,
and wouldn't you know it,

191
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,875
this site just happens
to satisfy

192
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,500
every last one of our wishes
and requirements.

193
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,041
[RED]
So what are you waiting for?

194
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,083
Hurry up and hand over the shop,
already, stupids!

195
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,833
[BLUE] Collette,
there's really no point

196
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,625
in continuing to bake things
you can't sell, is there?

197
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,666
You should just start another
business with the money

198
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,166
from selling us the bakery.

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,916
-[RED] Do it.
-[BLUE] Do it.

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,166
[BOTH]
Do it! Do it! Do it!

201
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,000
[STAR CHILD 1]
You guys are super noisy.

202
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,583
We're enjoying eating
our bread, so be quiet.

203
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,083
[RED] Gross!
Who the heck are these kids?

204
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,625
[CANCER] We're not kids!
My name is Cancer.

205
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,875
And I'm Virgo!

206
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,166
Hello, little ones.

207
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,791
The grown-ups are trying to talk
right now,

208
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,708
so how 'bout you zip
your stupid lips?

209
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,791
No, it's you old dudes
who need to be quiet!

210
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,833
-Old dudes?
-[CAPRI] I mean, is scaring

211
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,500
nice people like this
your whole job?

212
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,583
Getting paid to harass
perfectly nice people

213
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,875
is pretty freakin' lame.

214
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,416
I wonder what you
old dudes' moms

215
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,791
and dads
would think of that!

216
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,250
[STAR CHILD 2]
I bet they'd probably question

217
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,208
whether or not
they raised you right!

218
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,166
[STAR CHILD 3] Sounds like
we should be pretty thankful

219
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,291
that the Visitor is our dad!

220
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,375
[SCORPI]
Yeah, and we're lucky

221
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,958
that Alfie is raising us, too!

222
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,041
[STAR CHILDREN] We're so glad
we don't have to be

223
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,625
big, mean adults
like these bad guys!

224
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,416
[RED]
Dammit! Don't you bully us!

225
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,333
[BLUE] This isn't over!
You can't talk to us

226
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,958
any way you want,
you little jerks!

227
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,791
[STAR CHILDREN]
Bye-bye!

228
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,750
They've grown strong,
haven't they?

229
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,166
What's amazing is,
they do nothing out of malice.

230
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,375
So, Collette.

231
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,708
Tell me, are those two jerks

232
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,541
the reason people
don't buy bread here?

233
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,041
Yes. You can buy Lunch Packs
really conveniently,

234
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,083
and for a very reasonable price,

235
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,250
so they're understandably
popular.

236
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,541
But because of that, most of
the other small bakeries

237
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,708
are going out of business.

238
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,833
Back when my grandpa
was still healthy,

239
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,333
his customers remained
very loyal to him.

240
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,833
But now, since they've gone,
maybe we should close.

241
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,041
I'm sorry, Collette.

242
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,291
Want a useful hint?

243
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,666
About what?

244
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,333
Lunch Pack just happens
to be a business

245
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,208
owned by the family of Femiruna,
the Maiden of Leo.

246
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,000
If you, as the Visitor,
make the request,

247
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,291
Femiruna may be able
to help with this!

248
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,958
I can take you to her
if you want!

249
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,875
Thanks, Mana.
Let's go.

250
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,708
Back as soon as I can!

251
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,875
[FEMIRUNA]
I do understand the problem.

252
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,250
Unfortunately, I'm sad to say
there's nothing I can do

253
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,791
that will end up helping her.

254
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,333
Why not? Collette,
another maiden, is in trouble!

255
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,958
[FEMIRUNA] I feel awful
for Collette, I really do.

256
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,708
But I have to let that go.
I can't let personal feelings

257
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,791
interfere with our operations.

258
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,666
[ITSUKI] Can you help me out,
personally, then?

259
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,875
I'm begging you!

260
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,041
[FEMIRUNA]
Stand up. Don't do that.

261
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,958
I'm sorry. I do wish
that I could help you with this,

262
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,458
but I just can't.
Please excuse me.

263
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,833
-[ITSUKI] Wait!
-Let go of me!

264
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,166
[ITSUKI]
Please. Just listen

265
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,708
to what I have
to say first, okay?

266
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,916
No sir, I told you
clearly to let go!

267
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,916

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,166
Huh?

270
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,250
Femiruna?

271
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,083
Hey, Femiruna!

272
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,791
Where am I?

273
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,916
What is this?

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,666
How the heck did I get here?

275
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,541

Stay away!
Go. Get out!

279
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,750
Don't you dare
get close to me!

280
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,958
Okay, tell me who you are,

281
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,000
and what it is you're planning
to do with me.

282
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,500
[muffled murmurs]

283
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,250
What? What is it
you're trying to say?

284
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,000
[muffled murmurs]

285
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,166
[whimpers]

286
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,625
So, how'd it go?

287
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,916
She still seems
to be pretty confused.

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,333
We couldn't have
a conversation at all.

289
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,791
From the looks of it,

290
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,291
I think she'd have been
even more confused

291
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,666
if she saw my face.
Good thing I took your advice

292
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,500
and used that bag.
It worked fine.

293
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,750
It may have been an accident,

294
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,750
but she did hit
her head really hard.

295
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,166
I know.

296
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,958
But do you really think
this was a good idea?

297
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,208
[MANA] Of course it was!
You may be Visitor,

298
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,333
but if you were found guilty
of hurting a maiden,

299
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,041
that would definitely
be a felony!

300
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,125
You could even be sentenced
to death!

301
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,625
There was really
no other option

302
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,000
but to escape with Femiruna
if you wanted to live!

303
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
Anyway, what's the problem?

304
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,041
Femiruna is safe and sound!

305
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,625
So, it's all for the best!

306
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,541
I don't know.
I'm afraid what I've done

307
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,416
can never really be forgiven
at this point.

308
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,750
[MANA]
Look, if you're feeling guilty,

309
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,125
all you need to do is make sure

310
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,750
to take good care of Femiruna!

311
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,250
I bet she might even
open up to you

312
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,000
once she senses
your sincerity.

313
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,583
[ITSUKI]
All right.

314
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,041
You have my thanks, Mana.

315
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,208
I've misunderstood
you all this time.

316
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,916
I thought you were just a dirty
little raccoon

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,458
who wanted to create
Star Children

318
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,875
using any disgusting
means necessary.

319
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,000
-I'm so sorry.
-[MANA] Don't worry about it!

320
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,916
But don't forget,
you should really make a point

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,458
to thank Collette, too.
After all, we'd be in a bind

322
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,291
if she hadn't let us borrow
the stockroom for Femiruna!

323
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,208
You're right. I'll do that.

324
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,916
So, you think I'm
a dirty raccoon

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,250
who wants to create
Star Children

326
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,375
using any disgusting
means necessary?

327
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,291
You have no idea.

328
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,583
I was wondering how we were
ever gonna be able to convince

329
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,541
Femiruna, whose guard
is literally always up,

330
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,125
but look how convenient
this is!

331
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,166
It's truly a
one-in-a-million chance!

332
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,166
How will it all turn out,
I wonder?

333
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,875
Okay. I have to
get out of this room.

334

[terrified cry]

335
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,000
No way.

336
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,083
Where is this place?

337
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,625
Itsuki.

338
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,916
Femiruna's bread is ready
if you want to take it to her.

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,500
Thank you.
I'll do that right now.

340
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,916
I sure hope
she feels better very soon.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,583
Don't you worry.
If your bread

342
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,541
doesn't make her
feel better, nothing will.

344

Hey. Listen. What exactly
are you trying to achieve

345
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,041
by keeping me
trapped here, anyway?

346
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,500
[muffled speaking]

347
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,083
What did you say?

348
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,333
Am I here because
you're after my body?

349
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,375
No! You stay away from me!

350
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,750
I refuse to be tainted
by the likes of you!

351
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,583
[muffled murmurs, grunts]

352
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,958
One thing's clear. He wants me
to eat some of this bread

353
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,583
but I don't know why.
So, of course, now I'm wondering

354
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,250
what that brute
might have put in it.

355
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,250
I mustn't eat a single bite,
no matter what.

356
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,750
After all, I have
to maintain my dignity.

357
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,041
[stomach rumbling]

358
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,083
I'm not eating it,
no matter what!

359
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,916
[COLLETTE] You won't get better
if you don't eat.

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,791
[FEMIRUNA] I'm in charge of
my choices. I'm not eating it!

361
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm in charge of my choices!

362
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,083
Let's see how long you
can actually keep up

363
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,208
that dignified lady act!

364
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,833
[stomach rumbling]

365
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,750
[door opens]

366
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,666
[panicked, muffled speaking]

367
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,416
Your threats are not
going to work on me!

368
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,666
Enough already!

369
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,958
You're the Visitor?

370
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,000
[ITSUKI] Why aren't you eating?
You're gonna die at this rate!

371
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,708
Yeah, well,
why would you care?

372
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,333
Listen, I know it's true
that I've hurt you,

373
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,666
and that it's something
that can't be undone.

374
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,083
I get that.
But my intention to help you

375
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,791
was honest, I swear.
Please believe me!

376
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,666
You don't have to forgive me.

377
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,083
But you must take far better
care of yourself from now on.

378
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,666
Please!

379
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,166
[FEMIRUNA]
This man. Look at him.

380
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,208
He seems genuinely concerned
about me.

381
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,958
Now that I think about it,

382
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,291
nearly every person who has
ever tried to get close to me

383
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,750
has only been after some piece
of my father's wealth and power.

384
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,833
Such intense, passionate eyes!

385
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,791
I've never met
anyone like him before.

386
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,541
It feels like he only
has eyes for me!

387
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,875
I'm afraid I'm feeling
too weak to move.

388
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,958
Do you think you could
feed me some bread?

389
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,458
Is that any trouble?

390
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,500
Of course.
Very gladly. Here.

391
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,625
Open your mouth.

392
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,625
You might need to go
a little wider.

393
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,583
Here it comes, ready?

394
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,416
Putting it in.

395
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,750
[coughs]

396
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,791
[ITSUKI] Uh-oh,
are you choking? Take it slow.

397
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,916
Would you stop it,
I'm not a child.

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,166
Oh, good, looks to me like you
must be all better.

399
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,666
Yes, I'm fine.

400
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,333
Now, hurry and give me
some more.

401
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,125
If you say so.

402
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,083
[FEMIRUNA]
It's delicious.

403
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,416
Yeah. Don't you see? That's why
I've been wanting you to try it.

404
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,166
Huh. You're kind of a schemer,
aren't you?

405
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,458
It's nothing, just ignore me.

406
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,291
-More bread?
-Nope. Sorry, I'm already full.

407
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,125
[ITSUKI]
But, you've only had two bites.

408
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,750
[FEMIRUNA]
I said I'm already full, okay?

409
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,208
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,916
Um, well...

411
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,166
I hope that you have
a good night.

412
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,791
Same to you.

413
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,166
Itsuki, goodnight.

414
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,166
[MANA] This blond lady ended up
being an easy target, after all!

415
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,166
When a person's placed
in a different situation

416
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,000
from their norm, and they spend
lots of time

417
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,083
with another person,
they form strong bonds!

That's what Stockholm
told me, anyway,

but who would've thought
it'd work so well!

of time, now!

You know what?

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,416
That was the very first time
that I...

423
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,125
Let a man touch
my bare skin.

I'm sorry.

[FEMIRUNA]
Right!

I feel like I'm ready
to give myself to you.

I can trust you
with that, right?
