Hi, Visitor!

00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,500
Oh, Itsuki!
What a wonderful surprise!

328

I wasn’t expecting to see you
at all today!

I figured you might stop
by sometime

334
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,916

some to have on hand

How did he know it was me?

Welcome.

[ARIE] Hello, is the item
I ordered finished yet?

00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,333
It is, sorry
to keep you waiting.

361
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,958
It was quite a task,
I’ll tell you.

362
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,458
I can’t get over
the beauty of this steel!

363
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,833
The dark reflection is so deep
that it reminds me of a jewel.

364
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,791
[SMITH] Ah, there’s only one
blacksmith left in Granvania

who can polish steel
like that.

366
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,583
But why did you want
such an old-fashioned weapon?

367
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,583
We maidens cannot fight,

368
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,791
and that can be
very difficult to accept.

369

So, I figure, at least,
I can feel close to Itsuki,

if I keep mindful
with this naginata by my side.

really mean that.

to love your enemies,

troubling you?

think it would help you at all.

I understand.

Remember, love is patient,
and it’s always kind.

I can see all the love
