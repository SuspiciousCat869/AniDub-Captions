00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,333
[MANA] It was early afternoon
on a Sunday.

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,250
Catherine,
a beautiful country girl

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,791
who was new to the big city,

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,333
was swinging her hair
with wild abandon.

5
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,458
"Oh, Itsuki, you're amazing,"

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,208
she gasped as he [meow]
her to climax.

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,500
I'll never forget meeting her.
It happened at a playground.

8
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,125
I'd been having a lot of trouble
meeting my sales quota,

9
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,458
just like always, and I was
sitting there on my usual bench,

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,000
when suddenly we had
that fateful encounter.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,916
We were immediately
attracted to each other.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,291
It was primal.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,833
We felt no need to wait
before becoming one.

14
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,333
We just dove right in.

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,166
Before I knew what was
happening,

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,750
I was at her apartment.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
[MANAGER]
Don't worry, no one's watching.

[PEASANT GIRL]
Please! I shouldn't!

19

[GOVERNOR]
Sure you should, baby.

20
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,166
Let me show you.
A little closer, now.

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,958
[PEASANT GIRL]
Oh, my!

22

24

[ITSUKI]
Would you give it a rest?

25
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,250
How long are you gonna
keep this up?

26
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,291
[MANA] Why, what's the problem?
Don't tell me you think

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,541
the censors will take issue
with this or something!

28
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,125
It's my own imagination,
after all.

29
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,625
I can do what I want.

30
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,416
No, that's not
at all what I meant.

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,541
You know exactly
what I'm talking about!

32
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,458
Why are all of these couples
you and me?

33
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,458
[MANA] What are you saying?
Are you just not interested

34
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,875
in kinky role-play with me?

35
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,791
-Tell me now!
-[ITSUKI] Would you cut it out?

36

-[ITSUKI] No!

It's all going
according to plan.

[ARIE]
Hello.

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,291
Um, is there something
you're looking for?

44
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,791
No, to be honest,
I just happened

45
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,083
to come in here by accident.
It wasn't planned.

46
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,250
Well, that's great.
The church welcomes you,

47

no matter what may or may
not have brought you here.

[ITSUKI]
Right. I forgot.

49
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,125
You can call me Arie.

50
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,083
I am the maiden of Aries.

51
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,000
And I've devoted myself
to the church.

'Kay, so, I lied.

I was also hoping that
I might get to see you.

You mean you came all
the way here just to see me?

You have kids?

They're not mine.

62
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,458
I take care of several of
the children around here

63
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,708
and sometimes help them
with their schoolwork.

Hurry up, come on!

We have a special guest.

Good work, Itsuki!

What should I do?

anyway?

What was her name?

Yuzuha?
Is that right?

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,916
I wonder if she was able
to get anything for lunch.

the protagonist is very crafty

and gives her a present
she loves,

no filling, then.

00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,375
Oh, I'm sorry!

160
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,791
Please forgive me.

161
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,916
No, you have nothing
to apologize for!

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,333
You know what else I did?
This is terrible,

163
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,666
but I completely forgot
to greet you!

164
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,208
So, um, I guess I...

165
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,791
Here I am, greeting you!

166
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,833
Hello, there.
Uh...

167
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,291
I'm Yuzuha!

168
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,708
It's nice to meet you,
kindred soul.

169
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,708
[chuckles]
Kindred soul?

170
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,958
[laughs]

171
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,500
[MANA]
She said, "I'll pour some tea,"

172
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,166
as she shook his tightly
clenched hand with hers.

173
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,375
She went to the kitchen.

174
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,208
The water was boiling
in the kettle.

175
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,041
However, however, she felt like
she was the one

176
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,041
who was all steamy
and boiling inside!

177
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,208
The uncontrollable,
burning lust.

178
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,208
"I can't hold it any longer!

179
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,166
"Please, drink some of the
hot tea I just made!

180
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,416
"Swallow it with your mouth!

181
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,833
"Yeah, that's it!"

182
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,125
[slurps]

183
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,875
Is the tea okay?

184
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,041
Do you need anything?

185
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,500
No, it's really good.

186
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,458
-I bet it's not really.
-Huh?

187
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,791
Well, it's just...

188
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,833
I'm pretty sure my tea
isn't actually good.

189
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,916
I mean, I don't even
want to drink it, myself.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,625
No, I genuinely like it!

191
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,916
And I don't lie about tea.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
So, thank you, Yuzuha.

193
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,750
I'm so, so sorry.

194
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,458
Wait, what are you
apologizing for, now?

195
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,083
Something else.
This one is for calling you

196
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,500
a kindred soul without bothering
to explain what I meant by that.

197
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,000
It just popped right out
of my mouth

198
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,416
without even thinking about it.

199
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,250
Hey, please don't stress.
It was a compliment,

200
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,583
and I took it as such.

201
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,375
Good to hear.
I'm so glad, kindred soul.

202
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,958
So, tell me, Yuzuha,
what kind of paintings

203
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,041
have you been working on?

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
You said you like to paint.
Isn't that right?

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,708
It's not so much
that I like it.

206
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,375
-It's just my job.
-Oh, really?

207
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,708
-Cool.
-Yes. So, unfortunately,

208
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,666
I have to go
back and forth between here

209
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,958
and the academy
twice a day, every day.

210
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,708
I don't really want
to go outside

211
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,041
but what are you gonna do,
I guess.

212
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,083
You don't like being
around people?

213
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,041
The truth is, I started
confining myself long before

214
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,041
I was even chosen
to be a maiden.

215
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,083
For instance, when I sleep

216
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,416
and when I dream
I'm always in a box.

217
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,250
That's where I've always felt
the safest in the whole world.

218
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,958
So, then is the box
you're referring to,

219
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,291
the one right there?

220
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,916
You think I'm insanely weird,
don't you?

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,916
Well, that is a coffin, right?

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
Yes.
I gave it a name

223
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,208
so it might be
a little more palatable.

224
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,333
Katarine,
the coffin.

225
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,208
Wow, it's got a good ring.

226
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:56,708
But, doesn't one usually
put dead people in a coffin?

227
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,458
I know, but it's just
such a perfect fit for me.

228
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,416
I sleep so peacefully
inside a coffin.

229
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,291
I have very vivid dreams, too,

230
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,083
where I travel to all
different kinds of places.

231
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,291
You see, my job is to paint
the things I see

232
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,916
in my dreams each night.

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,541
I sure can't seem to sell any,
though.

234
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,041
Is that why you don't
go outside very often?

235
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,666
Yes, because I'm able to see
so many wondrous things

236
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,166
without going outside.

237
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,958
Actually, to be precise,
I used to see them.

238
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,958
Is there
something wrong, Yuzuha?

239
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,833
No. I'm okay.
I just haven't had any dreams

240
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,250
at all for a while, now.

241
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,875
[gasps]

242
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,375
I guess you might say I've kind
of lost my inspiration.

243
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,750
Maybe it's just what they call
a "slump."

244
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,708
But I'm worried.
If this goes on,

245
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm afraid that
I might have to give up my job.

246
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,833
That's rough. Hey, why don't we
go spend a little time outside?

247
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,291
You have to refresh your mind
once in a while.

248
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,791
I know, but I really
don't wanna go out there.

249
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,041
I've got it!

250
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,958
How about if I go and buy us
a few more sandwiches?

251
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,333
No filling, of course.

252
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:06,000
And then, we can go to the park
tomorrow and eat them together.

253
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,708
There shouldn't be
too many people around,

254
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,291
and it's close by.

255
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,500
Does that sound okay?

256
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,250
More than okay.

257
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,083
I wonder if I bought too much.

258
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,708
[MANA] I was so sure
you were going after Arie.

259
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,500
But your sights are already set
on another girl, aren't they?

260
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,625
You've got [bleep] of brass,
don't you, mister?

261
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,583
I guess I should really expect
nothing less from the guy

262
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,083
who just slayed
the Double Love Ritual, huh?

263
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,833
Oh, stop,
it's nothing like that.

264
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,500
Look, just try not to get
in my way today, okay?

265
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,666
[MANA]
Someone's a little jumpy!

266
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,333
You must really be looking
forward to this!

267
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,958
You're the real
Master Pervert Baron!

268
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,416
[ITSUKI] Enough with that
something-something Baron crap!

269
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,458
Leave me alone! Please!

270
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,583
[MANA] Well, in that case,
I'll just have to enjoy this

271
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,666
in a voyeuristic,
peeping role-play kind of way!

272
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,666
[ITSUKI] Stop talking
and get the hell outta here!

273
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,875
Shoo! Go on, shoo!

274
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,458
[sighs heavily]

275
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,875
-[YUZUHA] Oh, kindred soul!
-[ITSUKI] Huh?

276
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,875
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

277
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,875
Please forgive me
for being so late.

278
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,375
[gasping]

279
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,916
Thanks for waiting.

280
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,541
The sandwiches you bought
for me are so yummy!

281
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,583
-I can't get enough!
-Cool. I'm glad to hear it.

282
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,625
So, what made you bring
your coffin with you?

283
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,166
And why does it look a bit
different than yesterday?

284
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,083
I'm actually
impressed you noticed.

285
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,375
I made some cute decorations
for today,

286
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,375
because it seemed
kind of special.

287
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you think of them?

288
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,916
Oh, uh, gosh.
How would I describe that?

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,125
I guess I would say that
it looks very feminine.

290
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,500
That's correct!

291
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,958
That was my concept.

292
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,583
You saw it and you
understood it,

293
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,958
which means you understand me.

294
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,750
Really?
I was right?

295
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,458
Yeah, coffins can have
kind of a masculine quality,

296
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,958
so I thought it might be cute
if I made mine girlier.

297
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,625
Sure, that makes sense.

298
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,958
You know, talking
is my least favorite thing

299
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,791
and it's such a relief
to hang out with someone

300
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,500
who doesn't need
everything explained.

301
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,208
I really wish more people
were like you, Itsuki.

302
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,750
I think I should
probably point out

303
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,625
that we've been talking
pretty well this whole time.

304
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,958
Well, yeah, and that's
because you're yourself.

305
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,958
Hmm, I wonder why I'm so
comfortable talking with you.

306
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,625
I guess it really doesn't
matter, though, right?

307
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,458
[MANA]
Damn you, Itsuki.

308
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,125
When did you learn
about coffin role-play?

309
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,541
You've become
a high-level player

310
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,458
in such an impressively
short amount of time!

311
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,250
So, is there anything
inside the coffin?

312
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,791
It looked like it was
really heavy.

313
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,291
Well, I brought some
painting supplies.

314
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,916
[ITSUKI]
I see that.

315
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,541
[YUZUHA] Coffins are actually
very convenient for trips.

316
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,416
You can sleep in them,
obviously,

317
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,666
and you can haul things
around like a backpack.

318
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,666
Wow, that does
sound pretty handy.

319
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,958
Although, I'm not really sure
why I brought the paint supplies

320
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,875
since I know
I can't paint today, anyway.

321
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,291
You mean you didn't
dream last night?

322
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,541
[ITSUKI]
I see.

323
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,750
But, you know, you can paint
even if you don't dream.

324
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,625
Come on. Take a look.

325
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,833
Isn't it beautiful?

326
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,291
You're so right!

327
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
[MANA cheeping]

328
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,541
Hey, what's wrong,
are you okay?

329
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,291
Yeah! Sure!
I'm totally fine!

330
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,666
But what do you think
about taking

331
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,083
a long walk
over that way?

332
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,041
'Course. I think I'd go
anywhere with you.

333
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,416
[ITSUKI] Oh, I'll carry that.
Isn't it heavy?

334
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,166
No, it's fine.

335
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,583
I made this thing light
so it'd be easy to carry.

336
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,541
But thank you for asking,
Itsuki.

337
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,208
I wish there was something
I could give you

338
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,458
to repay your kindness.

339
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,083
I don't need anything in return.

340
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,375
But, I...

341
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,583
Hey, Mom, look over there.
What's that?

342
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,791
[MOTHER gasps]
Don't look, honey!

343
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,125
What?
But why not?

344
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,416
Sweetheart,
just stop pointing at it!

345
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,708
Come on, we're leaving!

346
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,250
[DAUGHTER]
But what is it doing?

347
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,583
[gasps]

348
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,833
Hey, listen.
I'm gonna go. See you later.

349
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,458
[ITSUKI]
Wait! Don't leave!

350
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,791
I never should've come.

351
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,333
I know better
than to go outside.

352
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,541
[ITSUKI] No, Yuzuha,
it's so great that you came!

353
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,958
They weren't talking about you!

354
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,625
I don't care.
All I know is,

355
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,291
I wouldn't have
gotten humiliated

356
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,625
if I'd just stayed at home
where it's safe for me.

357
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,041
Yuzuha!

358
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,333
[MANA]
What's the matter over here?

359
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,333
It's your fault!
It's all your fault!

360
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,666
[MANA]
What?

361
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,333
[YUZUHA] I'm so sorry,
sweet kindred soul.

362
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,750
You were there with me,
and they saw that.

363
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,541
So now, they probably think
you're a weirdo, too.

364
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,958
Forgive me!

365
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,791
[ITSUKI]
Lord. Help me.

366
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,500
I think somehow I hurt
Yuzuha's feelings today.

367
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,083
How can I fix it?

368
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,458
What can I do that will help
her feel better?

369
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,208
[ARIE] I think Yuzuha
walks a hard road.

370
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,500
From what I hear,
she's been frail since birth.

371
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,250
Is it some kind of illness?

372
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,625
Well, I don't know
if you have this in Sola,

373
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,791
but her condition is called
sleep sickness here,

374
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,666
in our world.

375
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,125
Sleep sickness?

376
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,833
[ARIE] Yes.
She burns away a bit of her life

377
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,458
every time she sleeps.

378
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,666
So, when she does,
her life gets shorter.

379
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,958
Those with the illness
don't live very long,

380
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,125
and there's nothing
to do for them.

381
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,583
So sad.
And there's really no cure?

382
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,375
Mm-mm. No, unfortunately,
no one has discovered

383
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,375
an effective treatment.

384
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,291
Thankfully, there's no pain
involved, though,

385
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,541
which is a blessing.

386
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,125
Death will arrive for her
while she sleeps.

387
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,291
She'll simply never
wake up again.

388
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:19,125
It may be the most peaceful
death one could ask for.

389
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,666
Itsuki.

390
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,125
Did Yuzuha happen to tell you
why she carries

391
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,416
that coffin around with her
everywhere she goes?

392
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,416
Yeah, she said
it makes her feel safe.

393
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,916
It's really for the benefit
of others, though.

394
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,333
She doesn't want her death
to be any trouble.

395
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,708
She wants it to be easy
for those around her.

396
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,750
That's just who she is.

397
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,791
I have a feeling
that's also why

398
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,250
Yuzuha keeps to herself
as much as she does.

399
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,625
So she's not a burden.

400
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,291
It's so unfair.

401
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,416
She's done nothing
to deserve this.

402
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,416
Why?

403
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,041
Listen to me.
Itsuki, all you need to do

404
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,416
is keep supporting her.

405
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,208
I have a strong feeling

406
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,916
Yuzuha hasn't quite given up
on life just yet.

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,291
I'm sure your presence
must give her hope.

408
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,333
So just keep showing
her kindness.

409
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,916
[hammering]

410
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,708
Whatcha doin', Mana?

411
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,750
[MANA]
Itsuki! You're back!

412
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm really sorry about earlier.

413
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,500
It's all right.

414
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,208
What are you up to
with all this, though?

415
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,791
[MANA] I'm building you a coffin
as an apology.

416
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,666
See, you can put this
beside her coffin and then

417
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,500
it'll be a double coffin
instead of a double bed!

418
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,333
-So you can make up using--
-Mana, great work!

419
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,791
[ITSUKI]
Yuzuha. Yuzuha!

420
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,666
You're in there. Open the door.
Come on!

421
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,208
Yuzuha!
If you don't open this door,

422
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm gonna have to break it down.
Is that really what you want?

423
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,333
No!
Please don't do that.

424
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,333
Oh.
Good, let's go for a walk!

425
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,750
No, I'm sorry,

426
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,750
I really can't go with you.
Please forgive me.

427
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
[ITSUKI] Wait!
Just take a look at this, okay?

428
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,125
It's Kanda, the coffin!

429
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,375
He's a new friend
for your Katarine!

430
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,875
And, of course, I brought
some sandwiches, too.

431
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,291
Don't worry.

432
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,458
If you can't see beauty
because you can't dream,

433
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,208
then see the world with me!

434
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,000
I can give you a tour
of the beautiful outdoors!

435
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,291
I want to see it, too, with you.

436
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,958
And I promise to hold you
if it ever gets scary.

437
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,833
I just want to be able
to spend time with you, Yuzuha.

438
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,375
Do you really?

439
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,833
[ITSUKI]
Come on. Let's go.

440
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,416
Okay.

441
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,916
-[splashing]
-[both laughing]

442
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,291
[YUZUHA] It's still bright,
so I guess I can't see it.

443
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,541
I was trying to figure out
where my constellation is.

444
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,291
Your constellation's
Pisces, right?

445
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,750
Yes, and it's the faintest
constellation

446
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,541
in the whole zodiac, which seems
pretty fitting, doesn't it?

447
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,250
That's so Yuzuha.

448
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,166
The shape is very irregular
and uneven,

449
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,833
so it just doesn't stand out
like some of the others.

450
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,208
Standing out and being bright

451
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,750
doesn't always make things
better, you know?

452
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,416
Well, if I'm honest,
being bright

453
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,791
and standing out
isn't very me, anyway.

454
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,083
But I wonder, why is Pisces
considered part of the zodiac

455
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,750
when it doesn't even have
any third-magnitude stars?

456
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,416
It's a Piece of the PIE-cies.

457
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,833
That's a pun bomb.

458
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,916
Wow, I guess you're really
full of sur-Pisces,

459
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,416
aren't you?
D'oh! Pun bomb.

460
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,958
[BOTH laugh]

461
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,666
Seriously,
remember,

462
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,625
Pisces was included
because someone found it.

463
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,166
I guess that's true.

464
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,708
Someone must have seen it
up there.

465
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,208
Yeah.

466
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,708
[YUZUHA] So, there are people
who can recognize it

467
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,833
even though it doesn't
