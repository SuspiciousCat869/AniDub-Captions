00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,791
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
The Love Ritual.

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,458
A sacred ceremony that results
in the birth of a Star Child.

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,625
As is their duty, the maidens
of the twelve constellations aid

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,750
the Visitor in the creation
of these warriors...

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,041
[MANA]
Ah, we get it!

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,458
Are you ready?

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,250
Let’s do it.

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,875
[energy bursting]

9
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,208
[popping]

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,458
He’s born!

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,500
-Congratulations.
-Huh?

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,958
What do you mean, born?

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,208
How could that... ?

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,416
I haven’t...

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,916
I mean, you know.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,083
The Love Ritual
is not a sexual act.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,250
As you begin to bond physically
with each one of the maidens,

18
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,958
your heightened
emotional connection

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,166
is what actually gives birth
to the Star Child.

20
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,375
I don’t know what Mana
might have told you,

21
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,958
but this ceremony truly
is a holy ritual.

22
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,041
Try not to forget that.

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,458
Oh.

24
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,916
Look!
It’s your Star Child!

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,208
[VIRGO] It’s very nice
to meet you, Visitor!

26
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,833
My name’s Virgo. I’m of
the maiden constellation!

27
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,416
This is just weird.

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
You must grow into a powerful
warrior to aid

29
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,750
Itsuki in his fight.

30
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,375
I will!

31
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,000
Look how cute he is!

32
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,833
I was just thinking
the same thing.

33
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,916
Thank you for this,
Mahiru.

34
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,583
[MAHIRU]
Oh. Good morning.

35
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,791
’Morning.

36
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,333
Yesterday was, uh...

37
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,625
Yeah.

38
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,500
[MANA] How impressive. I believe
I’m already starting to smell

39
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,291
the sweet scent
of ripe fruit. Yum!

40
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,458
And it’s all thanks to the Love
Ritual, of course,

41
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,791
which really means
it’s thanks to you, Itsuki!

42
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,708
Well, let’s be clear here.

43
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,625
It’s not like we really
did it or anything.

44
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,000
[MANA] Come on, how are you
even holding back?

45
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,375
I think she might be even
more voluptuous today, too,

46
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,333
not that you didn’t enjoy
her curves last night.

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,375
Am I right?

48
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,125
[MAHIRU]
You perverted raccoon!

49
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,708
By the way, where’s our
Star Child? Do you know?

50
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,375
[MANA] I sent him off
to a foster home, of course.

51
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,791
[MAHIRU]
What? Why?

52
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,458
Is there some reason
he can’t live with us?

53
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,750
He’s not just the fruit
of the love between you.

54
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,375
The Star Child is a warrior born
with a mission.

55
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,041
He has to become strong in order
to fight alongside the Visitor,

56
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,375
you see? Otherwise, he'll get
beaten up by the impurities.

57
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,833
[MAHIRU]
I didn’t realize...

58
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,250
[ITSUKI]
Can we at least go visit him?

59
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,041
Of course you can!

60
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,250
But keep in mind, you two still
have a plenty of new duties

61
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,791
awaiting you as the Visitor
and a new maiden of the realm.

62
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,666
Right.
Guess that’s true.

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,833
And we really can’t go back home
till we’ve saved this world?

64
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,625
[MANA]
Nope. So hustle!

65
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,541
Hey, I just had a thought.

66
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,458
Why don’t we stop for a little
breather near that corner?

67
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,250
And, action!

68
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,041
I’m late, I’m so late.

69
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,458
[clanging]

70
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,833
Uh...

71
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,666
What are you looking at?

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,458
Oh, sorry.

73
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,875
Give that back, please.

74
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,208
[RUKA]
I’m late, I’m so late.

75
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,041
Why the heck do I have
to do this?

76
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,916
What was that big show about?

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,750
She’s not much of an actress.

78
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
[chuckling]

79
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,000
[ITSUKI]
Good morning.

80
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,666
Finally, I’ve been
waiting for you two.

81
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,958
First off, I’d like to introduce
you to the other maidens.

82
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,166
[MANA]
Ah, good, I see you all made it.

83
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,041
Welcome.

84
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,625
This is a class for the maidens
of the twelve constellations.

85
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,083
Mahiru will be
joining us, as well.

86
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,750
Go ahead, introduce yourselves.

87
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

88
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,958
My name’s Itsuki Yuge.

89
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
It’s good to meet everyone.

90
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,333
Mahiru Konatsuki.

91
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,583
Nice to meet you.

92
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,833
Don’t be shy.

93
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,666
Everyone, tell them who you are.

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,333
You can call me Arie.

95
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,250
I am the maiden of Aries.

96
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,708
And I’ve fully devoted myself
to the church.

97
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,833
Hey! My name is Tarua!

98
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,666
’Cause I’m the Maiden of Taurus.

99
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,791
Also, I’m the best delivery girl
ever. Nice to meet ya!

100
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,250
I’m Lilith, and I’m
a fortune teller.

101
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,416
I’m the Maiden of Gemini...
What the... ?

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,791
Mana, why do you keep
randomly hitting me?

103
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,666
See? Her whole
personality changes

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,000
when you give her a little bonk.

105
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,250
I’m Ruka.

106
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,291
The Maiden of Cancer.

107
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,541
[ITSUKI]
The one from this morning!

108
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,375
Anyway, you really don’t have to

109
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,625
remember my name or anything.

110
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,125
I’m Femiruna.

111
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,375
pleasure to meet you.

112
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,291
I am the Maiden of Leo.

113
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,333
And now that I am one
of the chosen ones,

114
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,291
world peace is, quite frankly,
a foregone conclusion.

115
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,666
I’m the Maiden of Libra.

116
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,916
Mirei. Most of what I do
is research magic.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,333
That’s all.

118
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,666
Hi, my name’s Sue.

119
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,083
Sagittarius.

120
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,291
I take care of animals
for a living.

121
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,416
But mainly I like cuddling them.

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,166
Hey there, I’m Falun!

123
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,916
Somehow, I ended up
as the Maiden of Capricorn.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,750
Truth be told,
I’m an adventurer,

125
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
but I’m working at a bar
right now, so, you know.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,791
I’m Collette and I’m a baker.

127
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,958
Although, today, I guess
I’m the Maiden of Aquarius.

128
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,291
But still, though,
please come buy some bread!

129
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,083
I promise it’s real good.

130
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,875
I, uh...
I don't know.

131
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,375
I’m never quite sure
what to say.

132
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,250
I’m Yuzuha and I usually
make paintings at home.

133
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,625
Apparently, I’m
the Maiden of Pisces.

134
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,208
And last, Mahiru’s
the Maiden of Virgo,

135
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,208
and I’m the Maiden of Scorpio,
which is my great pleasure.

136
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,791
We are the twelve maidens.

137
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,666
And I’m Mana, a maiden born

138
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,916
under the constellation
of Lewd, baby!

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,666
And that’s why
you’re my favorite one.

140
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,208
Geez, you’re such
a freakin’ player!

141
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,208
Keep in mind, Itsuki,
you’re gonna have to perform

142
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,833
the Love Ritual with every
single girl over there.

143
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,625
Any ideas on how to seduce them?

144
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,708
Nope, very few
experience points.

145
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,958
Say no more.
Read this and learn.

146
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,458
It’s a gift from me to you.

147
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,125
An autographed copy!

148
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,500
It’ll teach you some moves,
if you get me.

149
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,750
I have to admit,
that sounds amazing.

150
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,666
You’ll learn all about manners,
etiquette, and foreplay.

151
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,375
Here’s a sample lesson for
beginners: don’t turn off

152
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,500
the lights in the room
or the fire in the pants!

153
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,000
And here’s a phrase for
emergencies:

154
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,541
"Let's come together."

155
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,791
-Say it for me!
-Uh...

156
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,250
Let’s come together.

157
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,958
That’ll do just fine.

158
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,166
Let’s be real, the maidens
are all virgins

159
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,583
so it’ll be easy as pie.

160
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,250
Think so?
That’s a relief.

161
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,583
Hopefully the book will help me
level up a little, too.

162
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,958
Remember, the stronger your bond
with those lovelies,

163
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,291
the more powerful your
Star Children are going to be.

164
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,208
So, work on forming the kind
of connections

165
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,583
that make you wanna
write home to mama!

166
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,916
I’ll do it for the sake
of saving the world.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
-[crowd cheering]
-[MAN] Yeah! Visitor!

168
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
[ITSUKI] And so,
my totally surreal new life

169
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,291
in Granvania began.

170
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,416
[RUKA] I mean, I did exactly
as you instructed,

171
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,083
but I don’t really
understand the point.

172
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,166
According to my official manual,
bumping into each other

173
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,750
is the number-one most effective
meet-cute encounter in Sola.

174
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,333
And the "point" is to help

175
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,375
Itsuki create
a super-strong Star Child!

176
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,250
How are you two doing?

177
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,250
Are you getting accustomed
to living in this world?

178
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,583
Yeah, I guess I’m starting to.

179
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,250
What about business?

180
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,666
Have you made any additional
Star Children yet, Itsuki?

181
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,500
[ITSUKI]
No, not at all.

182
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,083
[sighs]
Man, this guy is useless.

183
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,208
Oh! I’ve heard that there’s
a romantic event

184
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,041
called the viewing of the cherry
blossoms in your world,

185
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,583
is that true?

186
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,708
[NARCISSTES] Today, we've
decided to cancel our class

187
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,125
so we can sit outside
and enjoy the cherry blossoms.

188
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,000
Let’s relax and have fun
together today

189
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,791
as a welcome party
for Itsuki and Mahiru.

190
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,583
[MAIDENS]
Cheers!

191
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,875
Everyone, enjoy!

192
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,791
And please eat to
your heart’s content.

193
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,291
-Yay! Let’s dig in!
-Hey!

194
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,458
One of you, grab me some of
that fried chicken, would ya?

195
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,458
So sorry. I lost control there,
you guys.

196
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,541
Wow, try these chocolates,
they’re incredible!

197
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,541
-Whoa, you’re right!
-Femiruna brought these for us,

198
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,916
and I’m certain I taste
a hint of brandy.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,375
Very similar to bonbons.

200
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,125
That could be true,
I don’t know.

201
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,625
We always get a ton of gifts

202
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,125
sent to the house
because of my dad.

203
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,000
I just randomly picked one
on my way out.

204
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,666
[MIREI] Not surprising,
since your family’s

205
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,083
the wealthiest in Granvania,

206
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,541
and that’s saying a lot.

207
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,541
I like your chicken,
it’s really cute!

208
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,708
Thank you,
his name’s Quelquelle.

209
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:28,500
Um, ’scuse me, would anyone mind
passing me some bread?

210
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,083
Sure, I’ll get some for you!

211
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,958
I baked this myself, you know!

212
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,208
Here, enjoy!

213
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,916
Thank you, Collette.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
Hey, where’d Ruka go?

215
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,958
I don't know. She was here
just a minute ago.

216
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,750
[ITSUKI]
I’ll go look for her.

217
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,291
[ITSUKI]
Hey, whatcha doin’?

218
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,083
[RUKA]
Oh, it’s just you.

219
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,541
I wanted to bring
some flowers back home.

220
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,750
Makes sense.

221
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
They’re beautiful.

222
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,541
You see,

223
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,416
I work at an orphanage, so,

224
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,041
I thought the kids might like
to have something pretty.

225
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,125
Cool, I’ll help you out.

226
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,166
[RUKA]
Sure. Thanks.

227
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,166
Uh, that’s a little close.

228
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,541
It is? Why, are you thinking of
something dirty and wrong?

229
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,875
So dirty that I shouldn’t
even get near you?

230
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,916
You can try to hide it,
but I can see everything.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
-Huh?
-It’s true.

232
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,041
Because I’m an esper!

233
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,750
What does that mean?

234
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,791
I have celestial powers.

235
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,750
They’re strong enough that I can
actually read people’s minds.

236
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,000
[ITSUKI]
Seriously?

237
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,375
That’s right.

238
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,291
And you might be a gentle
and thoughtful guy,

239
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,083
but I’ve learned that all men
have nasty thoughts

240
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,583
racing through their brains.

241
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,875
That’s just the way they are.

242
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,625
Well, that doesn’t seem fair.

243
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,000
Really?

244
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,250
Then why don’t you
go ahead and prove it

245
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,416
by letting me
read your mind right now.

246
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,208
But if you’re thinking something
even slightly inappropriate,

247
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,083
then you can forget about me
performing the ritual with you.

248
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,083
-[ITSUKI] The ritual?
-Well, yes.

249
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,125
I’m talking about
the Love Ritual.

250
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,916
That thing is really intense

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,833
and it requires me to be
very vulnerable with you.

252
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,208
[ITSUKI]
Read away if you want.

253
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,916
All right, I won’t hold back.

254
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,458
What? Why isn’t it
working with you?

255
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,250
Is that big head of yours empty?

256
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,708
I assure you, it’s not!

257
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,000
Right.

258
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,916
Maybe since you’re not
from Granvania,

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,750
it doesn’t work
the same with you.

260
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,041
[ITSUKI]
Are you satisfied now?

261
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,125
I guess I’ll have to be.

262
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,375
I can understand why you maidens
would be nervous about this.

263
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,250
I’ll do my best
to communicate my feelings

264
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,291
with you along the way.

265
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,458
[gasps]

266
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,916
[RUKA]
I need to get going.

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,541
Thanks for your help
and the talk.

268
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,000
How are you, Itsuki?

269
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,500
[ITSUKI]
Um. Are you okay?

270
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,208
I feel warm inside.
[hiccups]

271
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,875
Mahiru, have you been drinking?

272
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,208
[MAHIRU] What?
Of course not, you silly-head!

273
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,125
Maybe it was those chocolates!

274
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,416
Well, I did just savor
an adult-flavored candy.

275
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,041
Which, of course,
are the perfect sweets

276
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,250
for a grown-up lady like me!

277
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,125
I guess the bonbons made
in Granvania

278
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,291
are too strong
for people from Sola.

279
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,625
[MAHIRU]
You know,

280
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,083
I kind of wanted
to give you proper thanks.

281
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,875
[hiccups]

282
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,750
Once, back when we were little,

283
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,958
you saved me
from a bad situation.

284
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,125
The day those bullies
were waiting for me.

285
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,833
There was something about you
defeating the Impurity,

286
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,166
it reminded me of that.

287
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,500
[ITSUKI]
Did I really do that?

288
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,041
[MAHIRU]
Oh, look, I made you blush!

289
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,125
Another thing.
You made me a little promise

290
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,333
when we were
in elementary school.

291
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,875
-Do you remember?
-What promise?

292
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,583
Ten years ago,
during the autumn festival.

293
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,333
[ITSUKI] I'm sorry.
I don’t remember.

294
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,791
You know what? I actually
had a pretty strong feeling

295
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,291
that you wouldn’t!

296
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,583
Mahiru, are you angry?

297
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,333
No, not really.

298
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,750
This might be better.

299
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,500
It’d be complicated
if you remembered.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,666
I guess we should probably
head back to the others.

301
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,250
Chop, chop, let’s get going!

302
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,333
Your sole mission is to
produce strong Star Children.

303
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,750
Isn’t that right?

304
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,250
So, you should really focus

305
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,875
on getting to know
the other maidens.

306
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,625
A promise from ten years ago?

307
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,250
[MANA] So, I went through
all the trouble

308
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,958
to set up the cherry
blossom viewing,

309
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,041
and you still can’t produce
a Star Child?

310
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,083
-Guess not.
-You’re hopeless.

311
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,041
Follow me.

312
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,416
[MANA]
You’ll need to start preparing

313
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,750
for the labyrinth soon.

314
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,208
Just looking at
all these weapons

315
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,125
totally turns you on,
doesn’t it?

316
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,666
[ITSUKI]
Huh? Huh?

317
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
[MANA]
You want me to keep going?

318
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,833
[ITSUKI]
Please. Stop.

319
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,041
[MANA] I don’t know, are you
sure you really mean it?

320
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,125
[ITSUKI]
Great, now I’m hard!

321
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,708
Time to stop messing around!

322
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,791
Do not underestimate
the labyrinth!

323
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,416
Seriously.

324
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,625
It’s a treacherous place
and your life will be in danger.

325
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,833
Many warriors have fought the
Impurities and never returned.

326
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,541
Believe me, you’ll understand
soon enough

327
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,208
why I’m going to
such great lengths

328
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,333
to make the Love Rituals
as successful as they can be.

329
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,458
This is the foster home
I told you about.

330
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,833
Your Star Child is here.

331
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,333
Want to go see him?

332
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,166
[ALFIE]
Stop playing around!

333
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,708
You think you can defeat
the Impurity Lord like that?

334
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,333
You should be
extremely embarrassed,

335
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,666
Virgo!

336
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,125
[MANA]
Oh. I see you’re already at it.

337
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,833
Oh my!

338
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,083
You’re the Visitor!

339
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,333
So nice to meet you!

340
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,083
Hold on, did her character
just switch?

341
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,833
My job here is training
all the Star Children

342
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,041
at the foster home.

343
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,833
You can call me Alfie.

344
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,625
Watch it, Itsuki!

345
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,250
You’re only allowed to ogle
the star maidens!

346
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,666
Couldn’t help it.
Sorry.

347
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,833
Virgo! Our Visitor here
has come especially to see you!

348
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,125
[VIRGO]
Hi, Visitor!

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,500
I’ll work hard to
become stronger

350
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,166
so I can enter
the labyrinth with you!

351
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,250
Great.
Thank you for that.

352
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,625
[ALFIE]
Pardon me, Visitor?

353
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,125
Call me Itsuki.

354
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,000
Itsuki, then. You must
produce more Star Children.

355
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,958
Otherwise, the battle
in the labyrinth

356
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,375
is going to be more difficult
than you can ever imagine.

357
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,166
[MANA]
She’s right, you know.

358
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,250
You have to perform more
Love Rituals and make many

359
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,083
Star Children before the
king orders you to go.

360
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,833
[ITSUKI] Well, the main problem
is, aside from Mahiru,

361
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,833
I don’t really know
the other girls.

362
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,666
[MANA] Haven’t you perhaps
had a fateful encounter,

363
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,958
or someone who made a certain
kind of impression on you?

364
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,000
Ru-something, maybe?

365
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,500
[RUKA]
Hey. Not so fast!

[wailing]

368
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,875
There, there, come on,
it didn’t hurt that bad.

369
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,791
It just took you by surprise.

370
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,291
It’s all right now.

371
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,083
Don’t worry, little one.

372
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,625
[laughs]

373
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,083
[ITSUKI]
I need to ask a favor.

374
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,250
I understand.

375
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:27,333
Ruka, would you please...
bear my Star Child?

376
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,625
Well, I've known that this day

377
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,625
was coming for some time,
and yet...

378
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,958
It’s just,

379
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,875
I have to head
to the labyrinth soon.

380
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,666
I don’t really mind,
but there’s only one Star Child

381
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,000
to go with me right now.

382
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,000
I think he’d be kinda lonely.

383
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,541
There’s only one?

384
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,083
Yeah. So, I think,
if there was at least one more,

385
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,208
it’d be reassuring for him.

386
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,041
While it’s weird that
I can’t read your mind,

387
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,708
I feel pretty sure
you’re not lying to me.

388
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,250
Also, I wouldn’t want your new
Star Child to suffer.

389
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,750
That doesn’t seem fair.

390
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,250
You must really love kids.

391
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,125
I’m never happier than when
I’m close to them.

392
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,125
I work with kids because I want
to feel like I’m doing

393
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,291
all I can
to help them out. And...

394
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,375
if a maiden and the Visitor
communicate heart-to-heart

395
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,250
and perform the Love Ritual,

396
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,958
then a strong Star Child
will be born, right?

397
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,750
[ITSUKI]
Yes.

398
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,333
Then, if we’re having one,

399
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,333
I hope it’ll be as strong
as it is cute.

400
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,416
I mean, having a child truly
is a miracle!

401
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,250
[ITSUKI]
You’re really kind.

402
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,500
Anyway, this seems necessary
to save the world, too.

403
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,791
Thank you, Ruka.

404
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,375
So, what now?
Where do we start?

405
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,166
Well, I did start reading a book

406
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,541
to learn a little bit more
about what to do, but I...

407
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,875
Wait a minute!

408
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,708
At least turn off the lights.

409
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,166
Keep them turned on!

410
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,416
The lights and the fire
in the pants!

411
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,958
It was one of the tips
in that book.

412
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,333
[RUKA]
No fair.

413
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,333
I’m the only one
whose heart is pounding.

414
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,625
I feel silly.

415
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,250
[ITSUKI]
Don’t. I’m nervous, too.

416
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,333
Well, didn’t you learn a line?

417
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,041
Something that’ll lighten up
the mood at a time like this?

418
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,625
Um...

419
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,041
We are gonna come together.

420
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,833

[FEMALE NARRATOR]
At midnight tonight, someone new

422

[pop]

425
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,875
[SHANGRI-LA]
The fate of our world

426
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,416
rests in your hands, Visitor.
I’m counting on you.

427
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,083
Yes, sir.

428
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,458
Visitor Itsuki,
I give you these Star Wards

429
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,500
for the twelve constellations.

430
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,708
That is not what I imagined.

431
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,791
Star Wards are created
by the maidens.

432
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,458
As you see,
there are twelve of them,

433
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,041
just like the constellations,

434
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,000
and they’re able
to absorb Impurities!

435
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,541
Learn more at the website!

436
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,875
Listen carefully.

437
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,083
At the very deepest layers
of the labyrinth,

438
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,166
if you release all twelve
of the Star Wards,

439
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,041
the Impurities will be sealed,

440
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,083
and your mission as a Visitor
will be deemed a great success.

441
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,541
I understand.

442
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,708
Now then.
Allow me to guide you

443
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,500
to the entrance
of the labyrinth.

444
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,166
[MANA] The power of the maidens
of the twelve constellations

445
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,208
is needed to gain access
to the Stardust Labyrinth.

446
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,208
This gate is the entrance,
as you might guess,

447
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,458
and it has been prepared
for the Visitor.

448
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,625
The labyrinth was built
by Mirei’s ancestors

449
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,958
in order to seal
off the Impurities.

450
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,625
The time has come.

451
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,625
We will now commence
the Ritual of Star Wards

452
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,666
for the sealed gate
of the Stardust Labyrinth.

We’re all
counting on you, Itsuki.

00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,500
Thanks.

as a guide
to help you out for the day.

460
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,750
It’s good manners
to ease someone in

461
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,291
when it’s their very first time!

462
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
[ITSUKI]
It’s just like a maze.

463
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,125
How do you figure out
which way to go?

464
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,291
[MANA]
The Stardust Labyrinth

465
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,000
has twelve separate
bottom layers.

466
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,166
One dedicated to
each constellation.

467
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,291
See, you can think of it
just like this.

468
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,166
An Impurity Lord will be waiting
for you at each bottom layer.

469
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,916
You should treat each of them
as if they are the final boss.

470
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,208
[ITSUKI]
Are they strong?

471
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,791
Yeah, obviously.

472
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,291
Impurities are made
from negative energy

473
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,916
which is formed
by human interactions,

474
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,041
you see, and over time,
within the labyrinth,

475
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,416
they’ve become quite strong

476
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,333
through amalgamation
and synthesis.

477
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,750
But worry not!

478
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,708
You have your Star Children
with you!

479
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,875
Star Children!
Defeat the Impurity!

480
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,291
-Got it!
-Got it!

481
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,958
[MANA] Yeah,
that’s the way! Good job!

482
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,750
[yells]
Crap! There's the Impurity!

483
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,500
-It’s upside down!
-[ITSUKI] Oh!

484
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,166
[ITSUKI]
Don’t jump the gun!

485
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,916
You okay?

486
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,291
I’ll protect you both!

487
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,916
What do I do?

488
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,916
[STAR CHILDREN scream]

489
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,291
Virgo!
Cancer!

490
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,958
Oh, no.

491
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,833
[yelling]

492
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,375
[MANA]
Itsuki, no, they’re both down.

493
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:41,708
We have to turn back!
Listen to me, we gotta run!

494
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,250
[panting]

495
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,041
Now I understand
what you said before.

496
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,083
I can’t protect
anyone like this.

497
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,833
There’s a limit to what
I can do on my own.

498
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,125
I need stronger Star Children.

499
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,375
So, I’ll do it.

500
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,708
I’ll make more.

501
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,458
[MANA]
La, la, la, la, la, la...

502
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,000
La, la!

503
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,916
