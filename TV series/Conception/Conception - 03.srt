00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,750
Hello there, Visitor!
Thank you for saving us!

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,750
Wait.
So, you’re okay?

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,083
The Star Children are always
automatically protected

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,791
by holy Matryoshka dolls

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,750
when they’re in
any kind of danger.

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,041
Yep! So, you don’t
have to worry about us!

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,375
That’s incredible.

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,916
But what about your wounds?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,750
Are you saying that
you’re fully recovered?

12
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,833
Right!
We’re both as good as new!

13
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,375
I’m glad to hear it!

14
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,416
You stand no chance
against them right now!

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,750
Back to the foster home
for more training!

16
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,208
[VIRGO, CANCER]
Got it!

17
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,875
Itsuki, you must defeat
the Impurities next time.

18
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,083
Yeah, I know.
Apart from everything else,

19
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,666
I can’t stand seeing the Star
Children suffer like that.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,250
So, let’s try again!

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,791
Yes, honored Visitor!

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,333
Itsuki is beginning to develop

23
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,958
a rather moving sense
of duty as a Visitor.

24
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,375
[giggles]

25
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,125
All that’s left is to improve
his technique

26
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,166
for the all-important
Love Ritual!

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,208
After all, he was a total newbie
at sexytime stuff

28
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,666
’til just a few days ago.

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,416
So he could use a little help
with his [barking]

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,125
in their [meowing] and I’m
just the one to do it,

31
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,500
if I don’t say so myself.

32
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,875
[VIRGO, CANCER]
Help us, Visitor!

33
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,708
They’re way too strong!

34
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,125
Wow, already?
That's rough.

35
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,000
This isn’t good.
We can’t even get close to them.

36
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,375
We gotta have more training.

37
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,208
Don’t you get it?
This is weird!

38
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,166
Something’s really wrong,
Narcisstes!

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,708
[NARCISSTES]
Okay, calm down, Mana.

40
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,291
A typical Visitor
would’ve defeated

41
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,958
an Impurity Lord by now!

42
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,375
But he still can’t even seem
to beat a single minion!

43
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,625
[ITSUKI]
I’m sorry.

44
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,583
I know it has to be
my fault, somehow.

45
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,458
Hey, are you even listening?

46
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,333
I think you’ve forgotten, Mana.

47
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,208
The maidens of the twelve
constellations

48
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,208
have never all changed at once
in our entire history.

49
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,291
So, what’re you trying
to say is--

50
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,708
I’m saying that we’re in a real
state of emergency.

51
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,791
So, that’s it?
There’s no possible way

52
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,625
for me to defeat the Impurities?

53
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,208
That’s not what I said.

54
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,125
Our academics know what to do
thanks to ancient texts.

55
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,875
Though such writings
are often disregarded

56
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,291
as being stories
and legends.

57
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,541
Don’t tell me.

58
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,875
Do you mean... ?

59
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,875
Itsuki, listen well, now.

60
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,791
If we’re to get through
this crisis,

61
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,583
you have no choice but to
perform a Double Love Ritual.

62
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,708
[ITSUKI] Um, what's a
Double Love Ritual?

63
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
[giggling]

64
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,958
I bet you already know!

65
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,583
It’s a ritual where you have
two sexual partners at once!

66
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,916
Sounds fun, right?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,541
You obviously need
a lot of stamina

68
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,500
for this particular ceremony,
but if you can swing it,

69
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,500
it’s a practical buffet
for the senses!

70
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
A feast for your whole body!

71
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,666
Two arms and legs
may not feel like enough,

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,125
but remember,
you can always activate

73
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,958
Little Itsuki in the middle,
you pervert, you!

74
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,125
I don’t think I understand.

75
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,333
Fool!
It’s a three[bleep]!

76
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,833
A three[bleep]!

77
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,416
Would you grow a pair
and stop playing dumb?

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,958
I’ll put it as simply
as I possibly can:

79
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,500
it’s a lovey-dovey activity

80
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,416
performed by a group
of men and women.

81
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,750
Come on, you know you
wanna try it, right?

82
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,333
I can probably handle
a group activity, yeah.

83
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
You’re such a
good little pervert.

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,416
By the way, you can use these.

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,958
Believe me, this’ll be heaven.

86
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,583
Group cooperative play
that’s two times better

87
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,875
than sixty-nining.
A brand new thing!

88
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,666
That’s a little intimidating.

89
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,083
Don’t worry about a thing!
The Visitor can relax

90
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,625
and leave everything
to the maidens!

91
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,208
You know, it’s, what do you
call it? In Sola.

92
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,250
Oh, you know, the fish
that’s popular for sushi!

93
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,291
Are you talking
about tuna, my fave?

94
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
[MANA]
Yes! That! Tuna!

95
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,875
All you need to do
is be present and relax

96
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,083
and focus all of your attention
on one spot.

97
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,791
Just lay there like a dead fish

98
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,541
and the two maidens will happily
tussle and cook you right up!

99
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,750
[NARCISSTES]
According to the ancient texts,

100
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,583
the Star Children
who are born as a product

101
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,000
of the Double Love Ritual
are even more remarkable.

102
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,666
Supposedly, even stronger than
the ones you’ve already made.

103
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,458
Why, "supposedly?"

104
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,416
[NARCISSTES] For at least
the past few hundred years,

105
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,125
a Visitor capable of bonding
with multiple maidens at once

106
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,666
was not thought
to actually exist.

107
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,541
In other words, the Double Love
Ritual is uncharted territory,

108
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,000
even for us.

109
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,708
[ITSUKI]
No pressure, then.

110
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,916
On top of that, we really have
no way of knowing

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,166
what kind of damage
this could do to your body.

112
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,666
A Visitor’s bond with a maiden
is very intense.

113
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,250
Well, is there any other way?

114
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,666
[NARCISSTES] I’m sorry.
We can't find a better path

115
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,375
to defeating
the Impurities right now.

116
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,791
Just think about it:
the lucky Visitor with the duty

117
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,458
to bond intimately
with the beautiful maidens

118
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,333
of the twelve
constellations is you!

119
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,541
Isn’t that amazing?

120
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,875
Don’t you feel like
the luckiest?

121
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,458
You should be proud,
you’ll be a pioneer

122
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,666
exploring bold new frontiers!

123
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,125
Just give me
a minute to process.

124
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,041
[MAHIRU]
I wish Mana knew how not subtle

125
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,875
this outing actually is.

126
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,958
We have hot springs
in Granvania,

127
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,500
just like you do in Sola!

128
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,500
It’ll be a great chance
for you both to relax

129
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,791
and get some much
needed R and R.

130
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,000
Not to mention, doing it under
the big, open sky

131
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,333
is liberating as heck!

132
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,583
The only real drawback is,

133
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,041
you might totally
wear yourselves out

134
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,125
and be even more exhausted
when you get back!

135
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,750
[laughs]

136
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah, it’s pretty obvious
he’s up to something again.

137
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,791
What do you mean, "again?"

138
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,333
Well, there’s
this Double Love Ritual

139
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,750
he wants me to do-- Oh!

140
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,666
Oh, don’t stop now.
A Double Love Ritual, huh?

141
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,875
Yeah. Never mind.

142
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,708
Itsuki, you really are one
of the most frustrating people--

143
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,166
-[shouts]
-[ITSUKI grunts]

144
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,416
Don’t worry,
I’ll grab your bag.

145
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,625
What is this?

146
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,791
He’s not lookin’
very good, is he?

147
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey! That’s private!

148
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,250
Wait, is that thing
what I think it is?

149
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,875
Don’t get any stupid ideas!

150
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,625
I’m just keeping it
because it’s cute.

151
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,708
It has nothing to do with
the fact that you gave it to me

152
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,125
so get that out of your head!

153
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,250
Wow! I’ve never been to a hot
spring quite like this before!

154
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,000
[ITSUKI] It looks like
there’s only one spring.

155
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,500
[MAHIRU] Who cares?
We’ll go in together.

156
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,833
We used to take baths
together all the time.

157
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,083
Yeah, same same.

158
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,458
Are you kidding me right now?

159
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,500
We were, like,
five years old then!

160
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,458
Stop freaking out.
I’m getting in, so deal with it.

161
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,833
Mahiru, come on!
Cut it out!

162
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,541
Would you please get your dirty
mind out of the gutter?

163
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,166
I came totally prepared
for something like this.

164
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,375
It’s so good.
Feels like I’m about to melt.

165
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,291
Itsuki, aren’t you gonna get in?

166
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,250
Why are you making
such a huge deal about this?

167
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,000
Just take ’em off, already!

168
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,833
Just don’t look, okay?

169
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,708
'Course not.
I’m not the perv around here.

170
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,250
[ITSUKI] Wow.
This place really is wonderful.

171
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,000
Although, it does
sting a little bit.

172
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,041
What’s wrong?

173
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,333
[MAHIRU]
That mark.

174
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,666
[ITSUKI]
Oh, sorry.

175
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,791
Is there dirt on me
or something?

176
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,125
No, it’s not that.

177
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,958
Why do you have
so many injuries?

178
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
[ITSUKI]
I guess from training.

179
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,208
It feels like I’ve leveled up
kind of a lot.

180
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,541
Still not strong enough to beat
Impurities, though.

181
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,291
So, you’ll make more, then.
Star Children.

182
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,125
Yes, of course.

183
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,916
I have to try.

184
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,875
What’s wrong, Mahiru?

185
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,041
Hey.
You in there?

186
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,458
Listen well, warrior.

187
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,875
The battles may
be getting tough,

188
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,041
but you are not to die,
understand?

189
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,708
All of a sudden,
you’re concerned?

190
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,125
Shut up and listen to me!

191
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,458
I’m just saying
that you mustn’t die!

192
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,750
I get it. I’ll do my best
not to die

193
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,333
’til I can get you back home.

194
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,791
So is that a promise?

195
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,333
Come on, don’t worry.

196
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,875
The Star Children and I
are always getting stronger.

197
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,833
Next time, we’ll
beat the Impurities.

198
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,833
Despite how she may look,
Mahiru is really a huge crybaby,

199
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,875
so you should probably
keep protecting her.

200
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,958
Don’t worry,
I definitely plan to,

201
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,708
but Mahiru
isn’t really a crybaby, is she?

202
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,083
Yeah, it’s weird.

203
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,416
It’s not like me
to be insecure, is it?

204
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,541
But suddenly, here we are
in this strange place

205
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,875
and they’re telling us

206
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,416
we’ve been chosen
as Visitor and maiden.

207
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,541
And I really can’t believe
that just a few days ago

208
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,708
we were in a love ritual.

209
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,958
-[whimpering]
-[splashing]

210
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,125
[ITSUKI]
Hey, where’d you go?

211
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,333
Oh, my gosh.
What happened to me?

212
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,708
Passed out from the heat.
You okay?

213
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,583
How ya feeling?

214
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,208
[MAHIRU] Wow.
I’m sorry I’ve been such a pain.

215
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,541
[ITSUIKI]
You haven't.

216
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,958
It’s getting kind of
chilly, though.

217
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,708
We should head back.

218
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,291
[MAHIRU]
Okay, let’s go.

219
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,000
Wait, where’s my key chain?

220
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,791
Oh, sorry. I think I was just
so focused on trying

221
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,583
to save you
that I forgot about it.

222
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,000
I’m sure it’s down in the bottom
of the hot spring.

223
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, my gosh, it can’t
be gone. It can't.

224
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,625
Hey, what are you doing?

225
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,958
-[splashing]
-[MAHIRU] It’s freezing!

226
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,375
[ITSUKI] I heard this hot spring
turns into cold water

227
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,000
after sunset.
Why don’t you go get changed?

228
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,458
I’ll wait for you.

229
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,166
You’re the Visitor and the fate
of this world

230
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,791
literally rests in your hands.

231
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,000
I can’t let you catch
a cold or anything!

232
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,375
Don’t worry.
Wait here, okay?

233
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,458
’Kay.

234
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,291
Itsuki.

235
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,208
[ITSUKI]
Found it! Mahiru, I found it!

236
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,291
My sweet little key chain!

237
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,791
[ITSUKI]
Here. Try not to lose it.

238
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,041
I’m so relieved.
Thank you.

239
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,750
Hey, Mahiru.

240
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,916
Once we’ve grown up,
let’s stay together,

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,625
just like this, okay?

242
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,000
Itsuki.

243
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,875
No way, you actually remembered!

244
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,166
I did. Just now.

245
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,833
It was always my duty
to be at your side

246
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,583
when you needed help,
wasn’t it?

247
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,875
Sorry I forgot.
But you...

248
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,583
You remembered everything.
You haven’t forgotten

249
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,416
our promise this whole time.

250
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,333
It was silly.
It was just a promise

251
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,541
made between two kids.

252
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,083
I’m being stupid.
Ignore me. 'Kay?

253
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,791
Or don’t.
I don't know.

254
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,875
No way. That’s
the old Mahiru that I...

255
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,750
Sorry to interrupt, but please
hop inside this lovely carriage

256
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,458
and then pick up
where you left off.

257
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,416
You can enjoy deepening your
bond all the way to the shrine.

258
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,958
But don’t forget:
you have to hold it!

259
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,458
No premature anything!

260
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,416
So, keep that in mind
as you play!

261
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,250
You have to hold your bonds
at their peak,

262
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,375
and maintain that all the way
through the Love Ritual, okay?

263
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,875
What? But I...

264
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,041
[giggles] Don’t you worry about
a thing. In exchange,

265
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,083
I packed plenty
of recommended adult toys

266
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,708
for you to use
on your [squeaking]

267
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,125
and on her [squeaking]

268
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,208
and all I can say is, I think
you're gonna thank me, mister!

269
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,125
Ugh, why do you
have to talk about it?

270
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,291
I know where you’re coming from.

271
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,333
Girls in Sola are all waiting
for a prince

272
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,708
on a white horse, right?
If the prince wants some action,

273
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,833
then that’s fine
and dandy, isn’t it?

274
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,208
Oh, wait, I think I see
what’s happening!

275
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,875
Was the mere thought of
alone-sexy-time with

276
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,291
Itsuki enough to get
your [bleep] all [bleep]

277
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,375
and hot and bothered, Mahiru?
[giggles]

278
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,208
Well, if not, don’t worry.
I've got plenty

279
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,916
of lubricating
options in there, including

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,166
[bird chirping]-flavored,
so please, help yourself!

281
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,958
Would you just
say something, already?

282
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,541
This one’s not about to complain
about anything.

283
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,041
Getting in this
see-through carriage

284
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,875
is the dream
of every person in Sola.

285
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,416
Apparently, you’re all
kinky freaks

286
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,291
who get off on being watched
by strangers!

287
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,041
Anyway, long story short,
this carriage

288
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,208
makes the dreams
of both men and women come true!

289
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,000
Its name is:
The Granvania Dream Coach!

290
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,208
-This is seriously wrong, Mana.
-Itsuki?

291
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,625
Listen, guys.
This carriage would be very cool

292
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,083
if we could see out
while we’re together,

293
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,000
and nobody could see in,
but that’s not the case!

294
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,625
You can see everything!

295
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,458
It completely ruins all the
excitement and titillation!

296
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,166
[MAHIRU]
Okay. I'm leaving.

297
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,375
All I’m asking is that
you do something

298
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,250
to take care of his wounds!
Got it? I'm counting on you!

299
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,708
But I put so much work
into that particular plan!

300
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,625
It was a masterpiece that took
me ten years to complete!

301
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,000
[ITSUKI] Sorry, but the concept
was lacking.

302
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,833
[MANA] Shut up,
you ungrateful letch!

303
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,416
[REONE] You’ve become noticeably
stronger in such a short time.

304
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,125
[sneezes]

305
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,125
Oh, no. I’m afraid it isn’t
even flu season yet.

306
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,125
-What’s going on?
-Actually...

307
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,083
Long story short,
my perfect and fabulous

308
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,875
Double Love Ritual Plan
was completely ruined!

309
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,125
The legendary Double Love?
Did you really attempt it?

310
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,875
Heh, you bet I did!

311
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,666
I’m not so sure Itsuki should
