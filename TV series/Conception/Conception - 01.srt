00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,791
Wait, where are we going?

167
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,750
To Castle Granvania.

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,666
I want the two of you
to meet our ruler.

169
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,041
He'll be glad to see you.

170
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,000
My name is Narcisstes,
by the way.

171
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,875
I'm a court scholar
for the Granvania Kingdom.

172
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,875
[ITSUKI] And, uh,
that's where we are now?

173
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,208
[NARCISSTES]
Yes. And in our world,

174
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,208
we refer to your world
as "Sola."

175
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,708
[MANA]
Let me explain.

176
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,416
You see, Granvania exists

177
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,916
in an entirely different
dimension than your own.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,625
Many of the past Visitors
to our realm

179
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,583
have even referred to it
as a land of enchantment!

180
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,333
[ITSUKI] So, this world
and ours are parallel.

181
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,916
This is crazy.

182
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,041
[NARCISSTES]
I've brought them, your majesty.

183
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,958
[KING]
I'm very glad you're here.

184
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,041
I am the reigning
King of Granvania.

185
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,458
Call me Shangri-La.

186
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,208
I'm sure that the two of you

187
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,291
are more than a little shocked
and frightened

188
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,750
by this recent turn of events.

189
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,250
But if you would, I'd like you
to hear me out.

190
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes, of course.

191
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,250
I am not going to mince words.

192
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,666
Our world is being threatened
as it never has been before.

193
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,833
For that reason,
I'm looking to both of you

194
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,875
to save it for us.

195
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,875
You want us to save the world?

196
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,166
Why do you want us?

197
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,375
Are you really serious?

198
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,625
You two have
been chosen as Visitors.

199
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,416
You see, in our world, every
ten years, new Visitors come.

200
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,791
They appear from the sky

201
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,000
with constellation emblems
on their skin.

202
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,250
You have a very special power.

203
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,708
I'd like you to use it to carry
out this mission for us.

204
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,541
Or rather, I should say you have
no choice but to do so.

205
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,416
Understand, your power
is the only thing

206
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,125
that can possibly
save our world.

207
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,083
Let's be clear.
Are you saying

208
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,541
that unless we save
this world for you,

209
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,750
we can't go home?

210
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,000
[SHANGRI-LA]
Indeed I am.

211
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,541
You're very perceptive.

212
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,125
This is nuts!

213
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,416
I mean, we're seriously average
high school students!

214
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,416
And you want us
to save the world?

215
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,333
I mean, all of this is
just really sudden

216
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,125
and unexpected, right?

217
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,583
Mahiru!

218
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,958
[SHANGRI-LA]
Take her to the doctor.

219
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,833
[NARCISSTES]
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,791
[MANA] You must be
pretty tired, as well.

221
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,791
Maybe you should go rest
in your room.

222
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,083
[ITSUKI]
Where'd Mahiru get taken?

223
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,958
[MANA]
Why? Do you get a little anxious

224
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,166
when she's not around?

225
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,666
You creeper.

226
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,000
Always after it!
[giggles]

227
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,041
I can only imagine the
shenanigans you've gotten up to.

228
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,583
"Oh no, we can't!
The family's home!

229
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,833
"Not like this!

230
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,250
"Let's keep today our secret.

231
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,666
"Just you and me, okay?"
[giggles]

232
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,000
The two of you canoodling
under the same roof!

233
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,708
I'm so envious,
you Visitervert!

234
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,166
What's a Visitervert?

235
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,583
She's fine, you know.

236
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,958
She's just resting
in the doctor's office now.

237
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,750
The doctor said she's
simply a bit exhausted,

238
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,000
nothing more.

239
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,333
That's good news.

240
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,250
[MANA] We'll continue
this talk tomorrow.

241
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,125
I'll bring some food up
to you later.

242
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,708
You've got real hottie
taking care of you now,

243
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,458
so you should be
grateful, you know!

244
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,958
What hottie? Where?

245
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,791
Feast your eyes, handsome!

246
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Ah! You monster!

247
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,083
[GIRL 1] The honored Visitor
has finally appeared to us.

248
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,000
The time has now come
for me to fulfill

249
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,583
my solemn duty.

250
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:23,083
[GIRL 2] I really shouldn't.
They're so good, though!

251
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:34,958
[yelps]

252
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,416
[gasps]

253
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,250
What the hell is this?

254
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,625
Huh.

255
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,750
Your body's nicer than expected.

256
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,208
I actually feel encouraged
about entrusting you

257
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,791
with the fate of our world.

258
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,375
Huh?

259
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh. No, don't worry.

260
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,375
I won't be
taking your underwear off.

261
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,583
What's this?

262
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,416
Is it just me
or are you disappointed?

263
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,708
Maybe a little.

264
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,916
I'm the court doctor.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,291
My name's Reone.

266
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,666
Itsuki.

267
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,166
I want you to take a good look
at your body.

268
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,541
You'll notice, you now
bear emblems

269
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,583
representing all twelve
constellations.

270
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,958
See?

271
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,041
These mark you as a Visitor.

272
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,291
Physical proof.

273
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,708
What's next?

274
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,541
I mean, what are we
supposed to do now?

275
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,041
You're willing to
help us, then?

276
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,041
If it's the only way
to get back home,

277
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,916
we have no choice.

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,833
I know Mahiru wants
to return, too.

279
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,625
[REONE] Once you complete
your mission,

280
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,833
the gate of light
should appear to you again.

281
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,958
A Visitor's duty is to enter
the labyrinth

282
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,916
and quiet
the Impurities within.

283
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,083
Impurities?

284
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,791
The Impurities of the labyrinth

285
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,250
have turned into monsters.

286
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,708
They're extremely dangerous.

287
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,541
Did you say "monsters?"

288
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,125
[REONE] And at the deepest layer
of the labyrinth,

289
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,333
you'll find
the Lord Impurity.

290
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,916
It can't be defeated
by those of this world.

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,750
I'm sad to say, history
has already proven that for us.

292
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,166
[ITSUKI]
So how do I defeat it?

293
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,541
You'll retrieve the Star Wards

294
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,500
who have lost their power
from the labyrinth.

295
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,916
In addition, you will also need
to produce new ones.

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,625
That way, the labyrinth

297
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,000
will be able to contain
the Impurities again.

298
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,166
Star Wards, huh?

299
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,000
Look at this to learn more.

300
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,458
Do your best to figure
it out as you go.

301
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,708
[ITSUKI]
But...

302
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,875
I'm just a normal human being.

303
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,708
I don't have the power
to fight monsters.

304
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,125
[REONE]
I beg to differ.

305
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,625
You're a Visitor.

306
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,583
You're the hero who's
destined to save this world.

307
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,458
Also, you'll never be alone.

308
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,375
To help ensure that you're
a success,

309
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,208
the twelve priestesses will be
joining you on your mission.

310
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,625
[MANA] The twelve maidens
are chosen at birth

311
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,166
for their ability
to purify Impurities!

312
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,208
They aid the Visitor,

313
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,041
and using their special ability,

314
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,041
they're able to create a Star
Ward of their own constellation.

315
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,166
And until it loses its power,

316
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,458
they fulfill
their designated duties

317
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,291
as priestesses of our realm.

318
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,500
Not only that...

319
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,666
but she's one of them.

320
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,583
Huh?

321
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,500
May I introduce you?

322
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,583
This is the priestess of Virgo.

323
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,833
[ITSUKI]
Mahiru?

324
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,125
I was given
