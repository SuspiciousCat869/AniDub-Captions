[MANA] Maybe you make

[TARUA]
My deliveries are never on time

Uh, how can you tell?

210
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,833
There's only one way to tell
if it's male or female.

211
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,125
You have to open the shell

212
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,958
and see what color
the gonad has turned.

213
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,708
It's actually pretty simple.

214
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,833
[ITSUKI]
Uhh...

215
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,041
[COLLETTE]
If the gonad is white,

216
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,083
it's male.

217
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,666
If it's green,
female.

218
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,250
And by the way,

219
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,166
you can only tell
if it's a boy or a girl

220
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,958
once the liver has fattened
during summer or autumn.

221
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,750

my abalone bread.

Will you please try
my abalone bread, Itsuki?

224
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,916
You...said that twice.

I don't know why.

00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,958
But I can't slow down,
so I keep crashing,

227
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,916
and then I end up
being super late.

228
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,875
[MANA] Maybe you should
deliver less at a time?

Though most days,
it takes me twice as long

of work that he does, so.

00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,333
My master was kind enough
to teach me everything he knows.

But well...

245
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,333
he doesn't think

246
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,166
I can become as great
as he is at making deliveries.

247

324
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,625
and the festival committee said

325
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,416
this was the only
one they had left.

326
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,708
Sorry for butting in.

327
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,083
So then...

328
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,541
why are you two
selling these things anyway?

329
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,083
Doesn't Femiruna's father
own the sandwich company?

330
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,625
Because Mahiru and I

331
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,625
have been given
a very special mission today.

332
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,666
Femiruna's dad asked
if we would take her place.

333
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,750
He said something awful
has happened to her

334
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,625
and that's why
she isn't able to be here.

335
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,125
[MAHIRU] He said "I need you
to take my daughter's place

336
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,333
"at the festival today.

337
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,250
I can't seem to find her
anywhere."

338
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,208
Uh...

339
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,750
And you see,

340
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,833
I'm here because I collected
a hundred purchase stamps

341
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,166
from sandwich packs

342
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,875
and, even though
it's a little embarrassing,

343
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,500
Femiruna's father
and his company

344
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,708
have named me
Ms. Sandwich Pack.

345
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,041
Does this sash
look okay on me?

346
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,083
Oh, yeah.

347
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,291
It does.

348
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,750
[ITSUKI]
What should Collette and I do?

349
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,458
I never would've thought
Mahiru and Yuzuha

350
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,000
would be selling bread
so close by.

351
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,708
Hey!

352
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,458
What if we competed to see which
team sells the most stuff today?

353
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,708
-You in, Yuzuha?
-Mm-hmm.

354
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,083
And we will win!

355
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,000
Aw, yeah!

356
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,666
[sighs]

357
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,250
You know, I'm actually
pretty relieved.

358
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,041
Now I can help out Collette
without feeling guilty.

359
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,000
[running footsteps]

360
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,833
I better hurry to
the Holy Star Festival!

361
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,041
I don't want to miss it!

362
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,041
[MANA] Tarua!
Wait just one minute!

363
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,000
-Ahhh!

365
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,708
[MANA] Can you please
deliver this letter for me?

366
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,708
-[boing]
-[TARUA] Ow!

367
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,166
[MANA]
Thanks.

368
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,250
[COLLETTE squeals]

369
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,208
We're completely
sold out, Itsuki!

370
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,458
Can you believe it?

371
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,166
[MAHIRU]
Where are all your breads?

372
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,625
We keep getting more and more
sandwich packs

373
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,625
delivered by trucks
so we don't run out.

374
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,333
Holy...!

375
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,916
Femiruna's company
can mass produce,

376
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,750
so it isn't a fair competition.

377
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,500
My bakery is a failure.

378
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,833
Don't say that!

379
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,333
You put your heart and soul
into your bread,

380
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,708
and that's what's important.

381
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,000
[gasps]

382
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,583
I do put my heart
and soul into my work.

383
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,416
[COLLETTE] Maybe that's the kind
of baker I'm meant to be.

384
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,750
Someone who cares more about
making great-tasting bread

385
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,250
than selling out every day.

386
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,125
Thank you so much!

387
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,041
I think...you just
made me realize

388
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,208
what really matters
when it comes to baking.

389
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,791
Uh, wow, did I really?

390
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,875
Okay.

391
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,000
Follow me.

392
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,291
I want to show you...

my gratitude.

[COLLETTE]
My dear baking partner,

399
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
I want us to be like
the Happy Bread.

400
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,458
To become one now.

401
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,791
The perfect pair.

402
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,125
Coming together to make
something special.

403
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,625
[ITSUKI]
What?

404
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,333
[COLLETTE] Like my grandfather
always used to say:

405
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,958
"It's easier to do it,
than to worry about doing it."

406
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,708
You're saying
you want to have my...

407
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,166
I see.

408
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,333
Shall we become
a Chikuwa Sausage Roll?

409
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,166
Mm.

410
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,250
Let's make Happy Bread.

411
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,750
Oh, I'm ready for it.

412
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,125
[pop]

413
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,041
[sighs]
Well, we finally sold them all.

414
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:34,000
[YUZUHA sighs]
If we're all sold out then...

415
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,833
what should we do now?

416
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,500
[FEMIRUNA]
Maidens!

417
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,208
If there is no food left,

418
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,791
let the people
have panties instead.

419
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,166
I wonder if they got
any sandwiches left.

420

Uh--

421
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,041
So many ancient
mysteries to solve.
