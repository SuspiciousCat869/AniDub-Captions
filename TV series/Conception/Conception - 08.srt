[SUE]
Bateira! I love it!

162
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,291
Did you know it means
"small boat" in Portuguese?

163
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,416
[ITSUKI] My heart dips and sways
with love for you, Sue.

164
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,208
Will you accept it?

165
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,416
[gasping]

166
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,500
Thanks so much.

167
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,583
[barking, mooing, clucking]

168
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,375
Well, well.
That was kind of a shock, right?

169
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,750
Who would've guessed the bateira
sushi would be offered to Sue

170
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,750
so soon!

171
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,125
That's quite a turn of events.

172
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,666
Yeah, I agree!

173
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,416
But can you explain
something to me?

174
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,916
What is the sushi thing about?

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,333
Wait, are you kidding?

176
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,333
How do you not know that?

177
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,875
Fortunately, I'm prepared, so
just take a good look at this.

178
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,833
The Visitor is allowed
to make bateira sushi

179
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,875
for anyone
he's feeling drawn to.

180
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,208
More to the point, only maidens
who have been given the sushi

181
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,291
can remain in the competition.

182
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,250
[ALFIE]
Oh, now I get it!

183
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,000
Great. Let's catch up with Mana
back on the scene.

184
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,250
Mana?

185
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,416
-Hi, there!
-What are your thoughts?

186
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,041
The sushi, right off the bat!

187
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,750
Not enough prior stimulation
at all, if you ask me.

188
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,208
What do you mean, "stimulation"?

189
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,125
[MANA] Nothing!
The real battle has just begun!

190
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,541
I'll set up a dirty date filled

191
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,041
with all kinds
of nasty perversion

192
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,208
for you sickos to enjoy
in front of your TV!

193
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,833
Oh, you love it, don't you?
Don't you?

194
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,000
-Admit it!
-[continuous tone]

195
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,041
[MANA] I have some
wonderful news, ladies!

196
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,583
You've received a second
invitation from Itsuki.

197
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,000
This time, there's going to be
a group date!

198
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,416
The participants are:

199
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,458
Lily.

200
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,833
Arie.

00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,083
Femiruna.

Leone.

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,375
Mirei.

205
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,125
The Visitor's
a very mysterious

206
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,500
being from an alternate world
called Sola.

207
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,333
I can't think of a more
fascinating subject to research.

208
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,125
So, I will. I plan to discover
everything I can about Itsuki.

209
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,875
Research is the reason I'm here.

210
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,541
The only reason.

211
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,166
[MANA] Welcome, maidens,
one and all! Itsuki is waiting

212
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,416
in the room at the end
of these stairs in front of you!

213
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,250
Only the one who reaches
the top first

214
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,791
can advance to the private date!

215
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,208
Easy, right? Or is it?

216
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,708
This next part is a present
from me to you.

217
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,000
Enjoy!

218
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,708

Lotion! Isn't it nice?

00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,458
Moisten the heck outta
that skin, dear ones!

222
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,791
Let it saturate!

00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,125
Super soft and smooth flesh
for everyone!

Now, climb!

What's wrong, you ninnies?

227
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,291
You can't stop now!
Keep going!

228
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,250
Not good.
I can't hang on any longer!

229
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,166
No, wait!
Please don't let go!

230
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,791
Hold onto it!
Don't you dare!

[MANA] Whoa!
The one with the perseverance

238
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,458
to make it to the top is:

239
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,833
Mirei!

Mirei, you made it
over to see me.

242
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,208
Thank you for that.

243
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,583
No. You don't have to thank me.

244
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,875
You know, if you want to,
you can take a bath

245
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,875
and wash all that lotion off.

246
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,500
Yes, that sounds
wonderful, thanks.

247

I can't see too well
without my glasses.

I think my vision's
gotten a bit worse again.

249
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,666
[ITSUKI]
Here, give me your hand.

250
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,791
How's that?
Is this all right?

251
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,708
Yes, thank you.
[laughs]

252
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,208
Is something funny?

253
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,458
No. I just realized
how nice it is

254
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,958
to occasionally leave myself
in someone else's capable hands.

255
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,375
This rose scent is lovely.

256
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,000
Hey. Mirei.
Are you sure

257
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,708
you're comfortable
being this close?

258
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,583
I am. That okay?

259
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,375
You see, since my eyesight
is so poor,

260
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,583
I'm a little more sensitive to
touch than most people would be.

261
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,541
The sweet heat
coming off your body,

262
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,375
the unique texture of your skin.

263
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,333
Oh, yes, quite intriguing.

264
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,125
This is a feeling
I've never experienced before.

265
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,375
[ITSUKI] Mirei, are you sure
you're comfortable

266
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,958
with everywhere
we're touching?

267
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,375
[MIREI] Absolutely. Let's stay
right here for a while.

268
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:22,375
What's this? I can't see well,
but it's very hard.

00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,625
[ITSUKI]
Uh, that's, uh...

270
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,916
Is anything wrong?

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,333
[ITSUKI]
Not "wrong" exactly.

272
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,500
I just don't think
you get what you're doing.

273
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,708
Look at that!
What a fascinating reaction.

-Now to collect more data.
-[ITSUKI shrieks]

275

It's all for research,
you know.

276
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,208
See, since my vision's blurry,

277
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,875
it makes me want
to keep touching

278
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,708
and maybe... lean into you,

279
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,041
and depend on you a lot more
than I typically would.

280
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,125
So... I hope that's okay.

281
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,041
Before today, I've only
ever seen the super cool

00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,125
and collected side
of her, you know?

283
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,958
When she showed me
this part of herself,

284
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,833
my heart skipped a beat.

285
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,291
You wanna know where
she touched me

286
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,166
under the bubbles, huh?

287
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,666
You know what?

288
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,916
I think I'm gonna leave it
to your imagination.

-[ITSUKI] Mirei.
-Hmm?

[MIREI]
Thank you.

292
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,958
You've decided to keep me.

293
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,208
How brave, Itsuki.

[sighs]

296
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,666
I've decided.

297
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,416
You should stay with me
a lot longer for my research.

298
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,916
And you don't have to worry

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,458
because I promise
I won't do anything too scary.

300
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,750
Unless you want me to.
[chuckles]

301
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,333

And so,

302
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,250
Itsuki and the maidens
went on one gorgeous,

303
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,083
memorable date after another.

304
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,416
And the ones who remained
at the end were:

305
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,916
Mirei and Sue!

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,041
It's all come down to these
two maidens.

307
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,541
Who do you think he'll choose?

308
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,333
Get cozy and settle in
as we watch

309
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,458
how Itsuki decides to approach
these two very lucky ladies!

Meow.

313
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,666
The truth is, this kitty cat,

314
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,875
she can get pretty lonely
by herself.

315
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,541
So you have to take time
and play with her.

316
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,416
Are you willing to take
good care of her?

317
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,125
Yeah, of course.

318
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,416
I love animals and I've always
secretly wished I had a tail.

319
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,708
I mustered up my courage
and put it on today.

00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,541
It looks good on you.

321
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,583
You know something?

322
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,958
I get this really steamy
feeling in my heart

323
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,458
whenever I'm around you.

324
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,458
[ITSUKI]
Steamy?

325
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,416
[SUE] I don't know.
Warm and comfortable.

326
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,291
It's a similar feeling as when I
was embraced by my mom and dad.

327
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,916
But I think now I might be
getting a little scared.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,333
Scared of what?
Of me?

329
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,625
It's just that I've lived
alone all this time,

330
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,250
so I'm afraid, if you spoil me,
then I'll become weak.

331
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,083
And then I really might
not survive without you.

332
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,125
[ITSUKI] There's nothing wrong
with needing people.

333
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,416
[SUE]
But...

334
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,125
[ITSUKI]
Sue, you've been on your own,

335
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,916
struggling alone
since your parents left.

336
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,250
I actually think you deserve
to be spoiled a bit.

337
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,875
But what will I do
if you end up leaving me,

338
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,833
just like my mom
and dad did?

339
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,583
It could happen.

340
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,500
You could just
suddenly disappear.

341
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,750
Sue.

342
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,625
I don't want you
to go to the labyrinth!

343
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,875
I don't want you to
put yourself in danger!

344
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,291
I don't want to lose you,
Itsuki!

345
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,708
I'm scared.

346
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,375
Hey, don't worry.

347
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,541
Living in this world
for a little while,

348
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,375
it's made me want to protect
everyone who lives here.

349
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,625
That's honestly how I feel.

350
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,333
To make that happen,
though.

351
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,541
I'll need to create a stronger
Star Child than ever before,

352
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,208
using the Ultimate Love Ritual.

353
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,916
[SUE]
Okay.

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,041
I promise you.
I'll defeat the Impurities,

355
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,208
and then I'll come back to you.

356
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,250
[MANA] I sure hope
that wasn't private!

357
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,375
We've heard your entire
conversation!

358
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,041
Learning about Sue's story
has made me do a little deep

359
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,333
thinking and now, I do believe
I've reached a final conclusion!

360
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
What conclusion?

361
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,750
Well, Sue and Mirei
have been competing to be

362
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,375
selected by you as the winner.

363
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,708
But honestly, there's no reason
the Ultimate Love Ritual

364
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
has to be limited
to one on one!

365
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,083
So, you're suggesting...

366
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,375
[MANA] Yes, an Ultimate
Double Love Ritual!

367
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,250
Assuming that's all right
with Sue.

368
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,208
I want to respect her feelings.

369
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,000
For my part,
I wholeheartedly agree

370
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,375
to doing the ritual
all together.

371
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,708
It means I'll be able to gather
even more interesting data!

372
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,916
Wow, both of us
at the same time?

373
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,666
I think I'd be way
too embarrassed to do that.

374
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,458
There's just no way.

375
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,250
I'm sorry, Mana.

376
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,458
I won't force her.

377
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,333
She isn't comfortable with it.

378
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,625
Not a problem.

379
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,708
I was actually expecting you
to say that.

380
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,416
Now, I want you to trust me.

381
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,250
I'm a researcher, after all.

382
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,791
So, I'm fully prepared
for an event such as this.

383
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,958
I've been wanting to test it.

384
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,333
This medicine should improve
Love Rituals.

385
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,750
Why don't we give it a taste?

386
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,250
What?
Okay, wait.

387
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,875
What is that?
Mirei! Stop!

Stay back!
No!

Just a hypnosis gas
of my own design.

390
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,375
You'll see. Now Sue
won't be embarrassed,

391
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,416
and she'll be more honest
about her feelings, to boot.

392
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,916
You okay, Sue?

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500

bonus for you,

[NARCISSTES] The ancient

of the Impurities in this world.

477
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
In other words, the Impurities
will just be revived

478
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,958
all over again
unless we seal it, fast.

479
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,291
How can that be?

480
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,625
[NARCISSTES]
We haven't found the entrance

481
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,250
to the thirteenth
labyrinth, though,

482
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,083
or figured out how
we can prevent the revival.

483
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,583
We need to make a request
of you, our Visitor.

484
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,291
Will you offer the help
of the remaining

485
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,500
Star Wards of the constellations
in our search for the answers?

486
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,041
Absolutely.

487
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,916
It would appear the Visitor
now has a brand new duty.

488
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,791
Sealing off the thirteenth
phantom is no small feat.

489
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,791
I'm afraid it'll be an even
tougher challenge

490
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,375
than before, Itsuki.

491
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,708
[ITSUKI]
Yes.

492
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,541
What's on
your mind, Mana?

493
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,625
Well, before now,
there were 12 labyrinths

494
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,083
and 12 maidens.

495
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,125
But since the existence of
the thirteenth labyrinth

496
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,583
has come to light, I have
a feeling that must mean...

497
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,666
Congratulations!
I think we can assume from this

498
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,875
that there's also a thirteenth
maiden out there for you!

499
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,041
So, as soon as you finish
the Love Rituals

500
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,541
with the 12 maidens, you'll
have a new girl to discover!

501
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,916
Oh, no, nose-bleed time!

502
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,625
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,250
Wonder where she is.

504
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,208
Could it be me, by any chance,
I wonder aloud, hopefully?

505
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,916
I can learn to like beasts.

506
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Oh my, you've gone through
quite the transformation.

507
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,708
And anyway, I've got
someone else in mind.

508
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,583
Who says the maiden
has to be a girl?

509
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,625
The answer is, nobody!

510
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,291
Sure, maybe.

511
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,083
Oh, my wow!
So, you're saying,

512
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,083
maybe our next episode
can be a Boys' Love Ritual?

513
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,250
No! But you know what?
I actually wish it was.

514
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,041
Our female viewership
would go through the roof,

515
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,750
that's for sure!

516
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:07,541
Maybe goodbye, doesn't
really have to be forever.

517
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,000
Pizza Margherita.
