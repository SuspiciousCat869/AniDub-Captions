Ritual of the Great Star Ward?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
[SHANGRI-LA]
Yes. The Star Ward offered

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,666
to the Thirteenth Phantom,
the last remaining Impurity,

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,916
is called the Great Star Ward.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,666
What sets it apart
is that this ward

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,583
will be the Visitor himself.

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,958
Whoa, hold on!

What's gonna happen to Itsuki
after that?

10
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,125
Itsuki will need
to be sealed inside,

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,708
with the Thirteenth Phantom,
for all eternity.

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,958
Wait, what?

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,791
And you want us
to perform the ritual?

Are you serious?

15
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,916
Granvania will be doomed

[ALL gasp]

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,916
[NARCISSTES] Itsuki has accepted
the burden of becoming

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,791
the Great Star Ward.
This is what he wants to do.

19

That can't be.

Itsuki...

00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,291
About being
the Great Star Ward...

22
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,791
I think I'll have to pass.

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,625
Oh, why the sudden
change of heart?

24
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,375
I'm sure it's because now
he has something truly special

25
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,041
to keep living for,
isn't that right, sweetie pie?

-Sweetie pie?
-Huh?

Those two sure are
getting along strangely well.

28

Did something happen
between them?

Oh, I think
they've done it, for sure.

Probably why she's acting
like a new girlfriend.

It's just... I want to keep
fighting until the end.

my full support.

I'm pretty impressed that you

decided to fight the phantom.

[ITSUKI]
If I sacrificed myself,

40

[ITSUKI]
I'm not finished living yet.

43

You sure aren't! We have
a beautiful life, a happy home,

and a brilliant future
waiting for us, Itsuki!

Huh?
Uh, right.

46
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,166
Anyway, I have to fight
for my future,

47
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,041
but you didn't have
to join me, Mana.

48

[MANA]
You go, I go, silly!

after experiencing

50

such a passionate embrace?

51
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,208
When that happened, the little
ladybug in me came out

52
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,125
and started dancing the samba
for all she was worth!

Yes, of course I will!

So, it's obvious that I'm the
woman he cares for the most.

I don't really think
that's what he said.

No, also, she's not my mom.

Okay, you're missing
the point, here.

He's trusting me with his
most precious things.

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,250
Oh, gosh! This must be exactly
what housewives feel like

go off to work!

Wait, don't housewives cheat
on their husbands, as a rule?

I thought all they
did was seduce

their husbands' bosses
and neighbors and stuff.

I was going through
old documents in the castle,

150
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,833
and I discovered one ancient
sheaf in the library which said:

"If the Visitor is able to truly
bond with each of the maidens,

how it's accomplished.

155

It's likely a hopeless dream.

be a way to avoid

It's too much of a gamble.

Maybe so,
but we have to try.

160
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,041
I ask you, now.

161
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,916
Do what you can to help Itsuki!

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,583
You can change the fate
of this world!

163
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,416
He said yes.

164
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,041
Thank you!
I know that we can do it!

165
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
Let's go, you guys!

166
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,541
Are you sure about this?

167
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,750
I didn't feel right
about sacrificing him.

168
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,458
He doesn't deserve that.

169
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,791
What is this?

170
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,291
Everyone, get ready!

171
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,500
That's a really
powerful Impurity.

172
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,916
It's close.

[energy surging]

174

[ALFIE]
It's the Thirteenth Phantom.

175
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,333
That thing came out of there
alone, which means Itsuki...

176
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,791
It's our turn to fight back.

177
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,333
Remember, we have our
instructions from the Visitor.

178
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,833
It's our duty to protect
this world from them.

179
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,625
I don't know if I...

180
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,833
[VIRGO]
You stay here and protect Alfie.

181
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,166
Don't worry, we'll go
take care of that thing.

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,375
[MAHIRU]
He's right.

183

[ALFIE]
You guys.

184
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,333
We're here because
we'd like to help, too.

185
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,000
We cherish Granvania
as much as anyone.

186
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,625
We can't just stand by.

187
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,958
And we refuse
to sacrifice Itsuki.

188
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,416
So, we're here to support him
however we can!

It's like the maidens'

and Star Children's powers
have synchronized!

You just saved my life!

Hey, no worries.

195
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,750
It was a piece of cake.

196
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,208
[ITSUKI] So, the Ritual of
the Great Star Ward failed?

197
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,625
The maidens must have
decided to stop it.

198
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,750
[ITSUKI]
Mahiru and the others?

199
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,041
But then, what are we gonna do
about the Thirteenth Phantom?

200
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,208
[MANA] Well, there's only
one thing you can do.

201
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,541
You have to defeat it.

202
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:25,208
I won't remind you of the
burden to save all of Granvania.

203
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,875
Just think of it as
fighting to protect

204
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,541
-the ones you care about.
-Mana.

205
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,833
This is the very last thing
I can give you, Itsuki.

206
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
The last thing?
No, please don't say that!

207
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,750
Oopsie!
Where did that come from?

208
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,375
Okay, truth be told,
this is what I was saving

209
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:50,041
to invigorate you
for our first night together!

210
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,750
Don't tell, but I kinda
"borrowed" it from Shangri-La.

211
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,375
It's so you can save the world!

212
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,166
I've always known
I could count on you, Mana.

213
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,166
I support my man!

[MAHIRU]
That's supposed to be our line!

224
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,333
You made the decision
to sacrifice yourself alone?

What the hell were you thinking?

Now, I know.

I don't want to become
the Great Star Ward.

Which means that I've finally
fulfilled my sacred duty

I don't want you to worry
about me, okay?

Remember, this is what I was
meant to do, from the beginning.

I was born as a Star Child,
then became a maiden.

And later,

262
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,166
I was able to love
and protect you, Itsuki.

That makes me so happy.

Itsuki right up to the very end!

She was right. That's what we
should all be doing!

Absolutely.
We're all with you, Mahiru.

till this is done.

Let's just hurry up
and beat that thing!

Otherwise, it's gonna
destroy our whole world.

that from happening!
