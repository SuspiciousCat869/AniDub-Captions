00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,416
Hooray!
I've finally achieved my goal

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,833
of repeating important
information thirteen times!

164
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,916
Oh!

165
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,208
Itsuki is going to die?

166
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,958
As in, forever?

167
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,916
He'll leave us?

168
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,125
What am I gonna do?

169
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,750
After hearing all of that,

170
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,916
how could I possibly...

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,083
[MANA]
Oh, hey!

172
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
Fancy meeting you here,
Itsuki!

173
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,375
You didn't bring a girl
over to the castle, did you?

174
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,166
And a royal castle, no less!

175
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,375
Not quite your everyday,

176
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,250
run-of-the-mill
love hotel, is it?

177
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,916
You've got some game, as usual!

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,625
Mana, sorry.

179
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,250
No offense, but,
I'm just not in the mood.

180
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,666
[crowd chattering]

181
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,625
To think...

182
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,125
they can all be so happy.

183
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,041
Have such carefree smiles.

184
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,291
What a sight.

185
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,500
So beautiful, and yet...

186
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,000
I alone have to shoulder the
burden of protecting this place.

187
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,708
Please. Please don't die.

188
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,041
I don't want you to go, Itsuki.

189
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,458
[ITSUKI]
What should I do?

190
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,500
What can I do?

191
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,750
[GIRL] Oh, wow!
Thank you so much, Papa!

192
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,416
I love you so much!

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,833
I love you, too.

194
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,208
Wait, that's right.

195
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,333
I have to buy presents.

196
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,916
Don't do it, Itsuki!

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
That's a death flag!

198
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,083
Don't trigger death flags!

199
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,291
Such a gorgeous view!

200
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,250
Whoa!
Take a look at that!

201
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,041
[ITSUKI]
Here. Take this.

202
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,333
Huh? Take what?

203
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,166
I got you a Christmas present.

204
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,541
It's also a thank you gift

205
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,625
for helping me with so much
over the years.

206
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,583
That's so nice, it's creepy.

207
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,125
No, it's not.
I'm trying to-- gah.

208
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,083
Ugh, never mind.

209
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,625
Oh, come on.
I was only messing with you.

210
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,291
[ITSUKI]
Just take it.

211
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,083
[MAHIRU giggles]
Can I open it now?

212
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,291
Isn't this...?

213
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,958
[ITSUKI] The one I gave you
before is all worn out now.

214
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,833
So I got you a new one.

215
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,500
See? Look at it.

216
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,166
It's gotten all old and ragged.

217
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,583
And it looks like
the chain's about to break.

218
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,083
I wouldn't want you
to lose it.

219
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,375
I might not be able
to help you track it down.

220
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,166
Found it! Mahiru!

221
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,125
I found it!

222
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,500
I think it's fine and I
like it just the way it is.

223
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,125
I'll keep carrying it.

224
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,500
But only as a good luck charm!

225
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,208
Really?

226
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,333
Then I'll just
take this one back.

227
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,708
No, no. Don't.

228
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,708
You can have two charms.

229
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,875
Thanks a lot, Itsuki.

230
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,208
Sure.

231
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,000
-Hey, Mahiru.
-Hmm?

232
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,416
[ITSUKI]
I made you a promise, didn't I?

233
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,375
That we'll be together like this
even when we grow up.

234
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,000
[MAHIRU] Yeah, but that
was back when we were kids.

235
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,250
I still feel the same way
as I did back then.

236
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,875
No matter what happens,

237
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,291
I'll be with you.

238
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,166
I want you to know that.

239
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,791
What do you mean?

240
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,791
You know. I, uh...

241
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,958
If like I had to go away
or something,

242
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,958
you can remember me
with that gift.

243
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,125
The zombie's you?

244
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,125
[ITSUKI] Think of it
as like a beacon of hope,

245
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,041
so that you can make it
back to our world.

246
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
I mean, even if
you're by yourself,

247
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,750
I'll watch over you.

248
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,750
I don't really understand
what you're going on about.

249
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,500
We're gonna go back together.

250
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,291
Mahiru.

251
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,958
[MANA]
Itsuki!

252
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,208
-Itsuki Yuge!
-Yeah?

253
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,500
[MANA] Let's go back
to Japan together!

254
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,750
-Huh?
-But before we do that,

255
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,375
I just was wondering, uh...

256
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,958
You stupid jerk. Why isn't there
a Christmas present for me?

257
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,041
[crying]

258
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,041
[ITSUKI] Huh. It looks like
Alfie isn't here.

259
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,250
How are you feeling?

260
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,166
[ALFIE] Okay.
A lot better than I did before.

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,916
[ITSUKI[
I made you something to eat.

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,791
Hopefully it'll help.

263
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,208
[ALIFIE]
It looks great!

264
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,708
I'm feeling more
energetic already!

265
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,291
I'm glad.

266
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,166
And I couldn't help but notice,
your collection's grown.

267
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,000
It has.
You could call it

268
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,250
my way
of escaping reality.

269
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,166
What do you mean by that?

270
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,708
Whenever I look
around my bedroom,

271
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,000
I can kind of forget
about the real world.

272
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,375
Oh, hey, that reminds me.
One sec.

273
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,541
I got you a few little things
for Christmas.

274
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,041
[ALFIE] Really?
You shouldn't have.

275
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,000
[ITSUKI] I wasn't sure
if you'd like them.

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,333
[ALFIE]
Wait.

277
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,166
It's Ire-neko!

278
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,750
I don't really get the appeal,
but the guy who sold it to me

279
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,541
strongly recommended all
of these gifts in particular.

280
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,208
It's a super-rare item
that I've been wanting

281
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,041
for the longest time!
Thank you!

282
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,583
This seriously means
so much to me, Itsuki!

283
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,125
[ITSUKI]
Well, that's a relief.

284
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,333
Now, how about
another bite of soup?

285
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,750
[ALIFIE]
Yes, please!

286
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,500
I apologize for causing
so much trouble for you.

287
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,083
It's embarrassing.

288
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,041
[ITSUKI]
I should be apologizing.

289
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,833
I was wondering if your
Love Ritual with me

290
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,375
is the reason
you're not feeling well.

291
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,750
And for some reason,

292
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,625
I got the feeling
that the Star Child you bore

293
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,625
is a bit different compared to
all the other Star Children.

294
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,250
[MANA]
I can't believe it!

295
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,625
He really didn't
get me anything.

296
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,500
[ALFIE] Listen, Itsuki,
what I'm about to tell you

297
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,375
has to do with everything
that's been happening.

298
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,875
[MANA] I bet Alfie is
getting her presents now, too!

299
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,791
What are they chatting about?

300
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,750
[ALFIE]
The truth is...

301
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,958
about 30 years ago,
I was born from a maiden

302
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,708
and a Visitor
who came to this world.

303
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,083
What? Alfie is the child
of a Visitor and a maiden?

304
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,416
But then, one day the maiden
who gave birth to me

305
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,833
was killed by an Impurity.

306
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,083
They feared for my life, too.

307
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,833
And that's why
I was able to escape.

308
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,833
I was told that
I was special, so...

309
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,041
A special child?

310
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,125
You were?
But how?

311
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,791
I'm a Star Child born
with a unique ability.

312
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,250
I have the power of the maidens.

313
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,583
-That's crazy!
-What?

314
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,583
Alfie is a Star Child
who also has maiden powers?

315
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,708
Oh, wow. She's so beautiful
for a Star Child, as well.

316
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,458
And here I thought
all Star Children

317
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,416
would stay children forever.

318
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,625
But, the thing is,
I don't have the powers

319
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,500
of a Star Child any longer.

320
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,791
You see, I've lost my
immortality and my strength.

321
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,250
Wait, don't tell me.

322
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,291
Was this because of our
Love Ritual?

323
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,000
That's not it. There's no need
to worry about that!

324
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,000
Even if I've lost
all my powers,

325
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,000
I have my duties
as a Star Child.

326
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,333
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm prepared

327
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,958
to do anything to defend you,
my dear Visitor.

328
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,291
And so, even if I were
to lose my life,

329
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,250
these tears aren't decorations.

330
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,791
Alfie?

331
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,625
Huh?

332
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,708
The JPOP Best Top Ten!

333
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,208
And this week's
number one song is...

334
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,458
"Naked Season" by me, Alfie!

335
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,708
Fresh, fresh, heart beam!

336
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,250
[grunts]
Huh?

337
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:40,041
[singing] The I in idol
stands for "I love you!"

338
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,625
And that love stays true,
through and through.

339
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,250
After all, Alfie is...

340
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,791
Thirty!

341
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,250
[singing] So that's why...

342
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,500
[exclaims]

343
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,875
When I see you like that,
Itsuki,

344
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,333
I feel...

345
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,166
So good.

346
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,041
Okay?

347
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,041
My fingers don't sink
into the paper piano!

348
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,625
Itsuki.

349
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,375
What is that?
What's going on?

350
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,333
Always remember,
you've gotta do it!

351
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,125
You've gotta do it.

352
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,916
You've gotta do it!

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,375
Come on!
You do it too, Itsuki!

354
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,833
If I have to, then, okay.

355
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,291
-You've gotta do it.
-You've gotta do it.

356
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,375
[BOTH]
You've gotta do it.

357
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,208
[BOTH]
You've gotta do it!

358
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,000
[BOTH]
You've gotta do it.

359
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,083
[BOTH]
You've gotta do it!

360
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,166
I never realized how strong
Alfie's determination is.

361
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,041
I've... got to do it.

362
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,833
Itsuki.

363
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,583
It looks like you've
made up your mind.

364
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,000
No. I can't be crying for him.

365
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,583
Even though I didn't get
anything from him,

366
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,083
he needs me now
more than ever!

367
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,291
Oh, why hello there, Itsuki.
You're back already?

368
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,708
I am.
I'm glad you're here.

369
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,500
You need
something from me?

370
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,708
You got a weird look
on your face.

371
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,250
I've been waiting for you.

372
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,166
Here you go.
It's your Christmas present.

373
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,958
What? Just some candy?

374
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,791
Hey.
I'm not a kid, you know!

375
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,500
[ITSUKI]
Of course.

376
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,375
That's definitely not enough.

377
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,791
But first of all,

378
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,458
I need to double check.

379
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,416
You do, um, fall into
the female category, right?

380
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,416
What?
Isn't that obvious?

381
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,250
How could you ask me that
after all we've been through?

382
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,458
[ITSUKI]
Mana, thank you so much

383
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,208
for supporting me
all of this time.

384
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,958
[MANA whimpering]

385
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,291
Uh, wait. Hang on a sec.
You're not...

386
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,125
You're not gonna tell me
to give birth to your child

387
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,291
or anything, are you?

388
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,750
[ITSUKI]
I am.

389
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,958
[MANA laughs nervously]

390
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,583
[ITSUKI]
Am I not good enough for you?

391
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,750
[MANA]
No, you are.

392
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,083
Wait, don't look at me!

393
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,750
It's embarrassing.

394
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,750
How could you be embarrassed?

395
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,958
You're so cute, Mana.

396
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,875
Come on.
Let's move that tail.

397
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,208
[MANA]
I'm so vulnerable!

398
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,666
But I'm also really happy.

399
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:53,666
I wonder if this is the last
time I'll get to see you sleep?

400
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,583
[MANA whimpers]

401
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,583
[MANA snoring]

402
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,250
[sighs]

403
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:30,083
Huh, wait. Itsuki?
Did you ditch again?

404
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,208
You are the worst!

405
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,791
Don't go off without me!

406
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,541
Did our night mean
nothing to you?

407
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,750
And after I taught you the
importance of sticking around

408
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,000
after you're done?
You get back here!

409
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,333
[ITSUKI]
Oh, man. Nice day.

410
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,083
Morning, Mana.

411
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,666
Uh, good morning.

412
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,666
Did you sleep well?

413
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,166
Listen to me, Mana.

414
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,208
It's time. Today,
I'm gonna head out.

415
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,083
[MANA]
And go where?

416
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,916
I'm gonna go to the labyrinth
and seal the thirteenth phantom.

417
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,208
Oh. Is that so?

418
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,500
[ITSUKI]
Let's not waste time.

419
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,583
Ba-bam!
