161
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,916
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Goodbye!

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,250
[MANA] Well, do you think
that means

163
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,791
it'll somehow be forbidden
in another way?

164
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,500
-Where should we go?
-Huh?

165
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,791
What?

166
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,333
[MANA] How about a Love Ritual
with optional play?

167
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
Get off me!

168
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,083
[MANA]
Or maybe some sibling love?

169
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,875
You're like a big brother to me!

170
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,250
Or a hot stepmother?

171
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,375
Oh, sweetie, yes,
but are you really sure?

172
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,583
I don't have
a little sister or stepmother!

173
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:58,500
I see. Are you suggesting that
we should step outside the box?

174
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,041
Next episode title:
Itsuki and the Horsey.

175
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,291
Have you lost it?

176
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,541
[baaing, oinking, crowing]

177
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,916
Are you off to Sue's farm

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,666
to find your next
sexual partner, then?

179
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,291
You're gonna drive the legal
team crazy, aren't you?

180
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,583
They're all such darlings.
Which one would you like?

181
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,375
You can pick from all the cutie
patooties here.

182
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,875
Who do you think
you're going to have?

183
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,375
Or maybe they'll have you!

184
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,250
[whimpering]

185
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,791
I won't! Ew!
Don't worry!

186
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,958
[MANA] Welp, what are we
gonna do, then?

187
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,833
Second round.

188
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,416
I'll just go through
a second round

189
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,708
to make the next Star Child.

190
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,000
[MANA]
Second round?

191
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,833
Start over, with Mahiru.

192
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,625
[MANA] This is the second round,
so it should be a piece of cake.

193
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,541
I'm feeling pretty confident
this time.

194
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,416
Why?

195
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,708
Men are so simpleminded,
don't you think?

196
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,416
Why are you trying
to play it safe?

197
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,416
Come on, they're called
"maidens," after all.

198
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,208
Can't we just
leave it alone?

199
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,708
But don't you see?
This isn't about second rounds.

200
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,958
What we specifically need
is a thirteenth maiden.

201
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,416
I mean, revisiting
storylines is good,

202
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,708
but we need
a new character, here!

203
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,541
I'm just trying
to think it through.

204
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,708
It feels like some kind
of betrayal to Mahiru

205
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,875
and the others.

206
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,166
[MANA]
Fascinating.

207
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,750
But how exactly
do you figure that?

208
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,708
It's not like you've been
monogamous up to this point.

209
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,125
Just think of the one phrase
you've said

210
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,958
to every single maiden.

211
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,166
Please have my child.

212
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,958
[yelling]
I'm despicable!

213
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,208
[MANA]
I didn't mean to make you cry.

214
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,291
I guess maybe you'd be
despicable in Sola,

215
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,666
but in Granvania,
remember,

216
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,958
those are the words
that will save the world!

217
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,916
[MANA]
What are you gonna do?

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,416
-[neighing]
-[MANA] Go for horses?

219
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,875
No, horses are out.

220
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,125
All right!
Good call!

221
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,666
[MANA]
I guess this is pretty much it.

222
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,958
Mana, come on, there have
to be other choices.

223
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,000
But, how can we introduce
a whole new character, now?

224
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,916
That's just so cheesy and it
would be way too convenient!

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,750
It would obviously be
visually pleasing with a hottie.

226
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,708
[licking, slurping]

227
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,708
I mean,
are they even qualified?

228
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,958
Huh?

229
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,750
You know.
Have they ever... ?

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,708
Oh! You mean, are they open
to being with another guy?

231
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,500
That's not what
I'm talking about!

232
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,750
Isn't it one of the main rules

233
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,333
that all maidens
have to be chaste?

234
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,041
Oh. Now I get it.

235
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,208
You're asking if these guys
are virgins.

236
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,791
Well, let's look at it.
Narcisstes reads

237
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,708
ancient documents
and researches all day long,

238
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,666
so I'm betting his only partners
have been books.

239
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,791
Yes, that's right, I want
to be bound up and put away!

240
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,208
Bind me and stash me
on a high shelf!

241
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,083
[MANA] Seiya, as you know,
is quite the playboy

242
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,083
and has the appearance
of doing well with women,

243
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,500
but guys like that
never want girls

244
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,958
to know they're
actually inexperienced

245
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,750
and often tend to
throw away opportunities

246
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,166
when there's a real chance.

247
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,458
No action for me, yet again.

248
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,416
[ITSUKI] Wait, there's no way
it's the King, right?

249
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,375
Here's the way you'll know
who the maiden is:

250
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,708
they'll be willing and able
to perform the Love Ritual

251
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,375
when the time is right.

252
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,041
Tell me something.

253
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,541
Why do you seem way
less invested in this one?

254
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,333
Have you just given up now,
or what?

255
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,750
No, why would you
suggest such a thing?

256
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,750
Listen!
We have to remember,

257
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,250
the entire point of all of this

258
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,708
is to save the beloved
kingdom of Granvania!

259
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,083
To seal the thirteenth
labyrinth!

260
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,458
We need a new Star Child
and we need it now!

261
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,958
There's no time
for hesitation.

262
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,458
Sorry, this is a new territory.

263
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,541
[MANA] I totally understand,
but you have to consider

264
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,083
the peace and future
of Granvania.

265
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,333
[SEIYA]
Itsuki!

266
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,333
I've been working on a shoot
for a book I'm putting together.

267
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,000
[ITSUKI, MANA]
So, selfies again?

268
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,541
Yeah, busted.

269
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,416
Hey, is everything okay, Itsuki?

270
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,250
Looks to me like
you're kinda down.

271
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,875
Anything I can do?

272
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,583
I'm a pretty good listener,
if you'd like to talk.

273
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,500
[laughing]

274
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,666
[MANA]
Well, would you look at that?

275
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,541
Your prey has come on his own!

276
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,958
[sighs]

277
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,458
The theme of my next photo book
is "vampires,"

278
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,875
if you haven't already guessed.

279
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,208
Wow, that's interesting.

280
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,250
So, what's up with you?

281
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,416
I don't know.

282
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,583
What am I supposed
to say?

283
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,958
"Are you into guys?"

284
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,916
"Are you still a virgin?"
No way!

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,250
Maybe you should consider

286
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,125
taking a little time
for yourself.

287
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,166
Man, I just can't
do this with a guy.

288
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,750
I'm sorry.
I know it must be hard for you.

289
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,125
Huh?

290
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,125
First, you're brought
to Granvania from Sola

291
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,583
as the Visitor.

292
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,833
You don't know anyone.
There's nobody to lean on,

293
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,833
and you have to spend your days
here alone as an outsider.

294
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,583
Actually, Mahiru is a close
childhood friend of mine.

295
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,875
And on top of that, you have
the duty of saving Granvania.

296
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,083
That's a lot!

297
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,041
I know the loneliness
you feel!

298
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,416
It's the same for me.

299
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,333
They say I'm the number one
womanizer around.

300
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,916
The definition of a playboy.

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,541
I do it because I think
it's what I'm supposed to do.

302
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,791
Then I make photo books
so I can escape myself.

303
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,416
Don't you have any friends,
though?

304
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,958
How could I have them?

305
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,708
This isn't the real me.

306
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,458
Sorry.
I got a little worked up.

307
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,000
[ITSUKI]
Stop. Please, come on.

308
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,916
Stop looking so sad.

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,416
[SEIYA]
Itsuki, I'm the only one

310
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,458
who can understand
your loneliness.

311
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,416
So, why don't we warm
our lonely bodies together?

312
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,875
Huh?

313
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,333
Is it me, or is this
wildly different this time?

314
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,666
Compared to how it went
with the others?

315
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,666
Obviously, all the other
maidens have been girls,

316
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,041
so there's that.

317
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,416
But there's something
more than that going on.

318
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,958
Wait a minute!
I know.

319
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,416
It's the fact that
I'm being seduced

320
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,958
rather than
the other way around!

321
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,625
Uh... I, um...

322
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,000
What, are you nervous?

323
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,916
Not really nervous,
it's more like...

324
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,333
That's good.

325
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,500
Wait, what's good?
What are you saying?

326
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,083
[whimpering]

327
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,625
We can live together,
or we can die alone.

00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,083
Change your angle of thinking.

330
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't know.

[camera shutter clicking]

332
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,458
Relax a little bit more.

333
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,833
I...

334
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,916
Take two. Okay?

335
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,791
I can't.

336
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,041
Sorry!
Just give me a sec.

337
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,416
I need a break!

338
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,083
Just think, you could've
stayed the night.

339
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,875
[shrieking]

340
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,291
[MANA]
What happened?

341
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,833
What made you run out
like that, Itsuki?

342
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,375
You seemed so close!

343
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,916
Yeah, if we were any closer,

344
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,250
he would've been
on top of me!

345
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,041
Seriously, Mana,
if we'd kept going,

346
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,666
I would've been the one
to give birth!

347
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,125
Who cares who's the one
giving birth?

348
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,416
What the heck
does that matter?

349
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,125
I very much care
whether I'm giving birth

350
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,291
for another man!

351
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,541
[MANA]
Oh, well. Let's try

352
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,416
-for the next one, then.
-What next one?

353
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,958
I've got to admit,

354
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,416
I never would've thought
you'd come here

355
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,333
just to see me.

356
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,166
[MANA] Well, I thought maybe
I should learn a bit more

357
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,875
about the thirteenth labyrinth
before proceeding.

358
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,958
Smirk.

359
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,666
Stop being so ridiculous.

360
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,291
I appreciate that attitude.

361
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,625
However, I'm afraid
there remain several mysteries

362
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,125
surrounding
the thirteenth labyrinth

363
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,583
and I'm still in the midst
of my research.

364
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,583
So, I need more time.

365
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,791
No prob. See you.
Bye.

366
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,041
Hey, you can't just
turn around and leave!

367
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,291
[NARCISSTES]
Itsuki.

368
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,666
Sorry, yes?

369
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,416
[NARCISSTES]
Don't burden yourself too much.

370
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,375
The sudden responsibility.

371
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,125
Shouldering the fate of the
entire kingdom of Granvania

372
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,416
all by yourself.

373
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,875
I know that's something
I'll probably

374
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,958
never be able
to fully understand.

375
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,333
I'm so thankful, from my heart.

376
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,875
This kingdom and everyone
in it really needs you.

377
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,583
I don't even know
what to say.

378
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,458
[NARCISSTES]
I have a question for you.

379
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,458
Ancient hieroglyphs can be
very hard to interpret.

380
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,500
[ITSUKI]
Oh. I'll help if I can.

381
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,458
[MAN]
Oh, yeah!

382
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,208
[shrieks]
Pardon me!

383
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,500
My body feels weird!
[yelling]

384
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,750
[MANA]
Itsuki!

385
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,500
[sighs]

386
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,416
Well, according
to the ancient documents,

387
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,583
human culture is traditionally
difficult to understand, so...

388
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,166
Shutting it down right
before the action, yet again?

389
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
Why do you tease me so, Itsuki?

390
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,833
Well, I guess, because he's
a man, and I'm still freaked!

391
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,791
I don't understand
why that bothers you so much.

392
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,833
Why not just go for it?

393
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,625
[ITSUKI] I don't know, it just
isn't coming naturally to me.

394
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,666
I've never been open to it,
so it's hard to change.

395
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,666
In my experience,
a person can change

396
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,166
if they really want to.

397
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,041
If a person can change
that easily,

398
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,416
then they must not know
themselves well to begin with.

399
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,083
Did you know I used
to be an Impurity?

400
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,166
No, I didn't.
Is that true?

401
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,291
It is.

402
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,125
A magician in this
wonderful nation

403
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,333
brought me out of a labyrinth

404
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,833
right around
a hundred years ago.

405
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,333
And they just let
an Impurity roam around?

406
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,208
No, they definitely didn't.

407
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,041
I've been told that
the magician was trying

408
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,625
to give consciousness
to Impurities

409
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,750
so he could find a way
for us all to coexist.

410
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,791
But I'm afraid the magician
tragically died

411
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,083
before he could finish
his good work,

412
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,750
leaving me behind.

413
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,708
I was an Impurity
in a new place with no guidance.

414
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,208
And I was all alone.

415
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,583
I was so confused and didn't
know what I should do.

416
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,041
Not only that, but when
the government found out

417
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,500
about my existence here,

418
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,333
they actually tried
to "cleanse" me.

419
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,416
What does that mean,
"cleanse" you?

420
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,750
They thought Impurities
shouldn't exist at all.

421
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,250
But surprisingly,
that Visitor refused to kill me

422
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,041
and he ended up choosing
to protect me, instead.

423
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,458
And I have been loyally serving

424
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,125
the wonderful nation
of Granvania ever since.

425
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,375
What ever happened
to that Visitor?

426
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,500
It was Shangri-La!

427
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,125
[ITSUKI]
What? The King?

428
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,625
Check the website for details!

429
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,666
[ITSUKI]
Hey!

430
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,958
[MANA]
Anyway, the point is,

431
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,375
if a person wants to change,

432
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,041
they can,
if they put their heart into it.

433
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,208
At least it's not
so bad for you, Itsuki.

434
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,208
As the Visitor, you're
automatically welcomed

435
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,333
by everyone.
Not to mention adored.

436
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,291
But as a former Impurity,
by rights,

437
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,416
I shouldn't even
be allowed to exist here.

438
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,166
Sometimes I hate myself
and my tainted past.

439
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,625
Itsuki?

440
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,083
Listen to me.

441
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,375
I don't want you to blame
yourself like that.

442
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,166
Oh, Itsuki.

443
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,416
I bet it must
really be hard for you.

444
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,250
Aaah!

445
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,291
I feel so close to you
right now!

446
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,166
Wait a minute.

447
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,291
I think I've just had
kind of a breakthrough.

448
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,375
Mana.
I think I can do it!

449
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,083
[MANA giggles]

450
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,458
The more you deny yourself,
the more you end up wanting it.

451
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,541
I see how you are.
Please be gentle, though, lover!

452
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,208
Where the heck did you go?

453
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,750
I'm getting very mixed signals,
here!

454
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,625
If I connected with Mana,

455
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,000
I just know I can do that
with another guy!

00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,541

We're all just people inside.

I want to get past old barriers
and ideas,

Very well said, Itsuki!

Now, if you'll both
just follow me,

it's kinda cool

475
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,708
Back up?
What are we waiting for?

476
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,208
Come on!
Let's do this!

477
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,250
Which of us would you choose?

478
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,750
Yes.
Which one of us would you pick

479
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,541
as the thirteenth maiden
if it were up to you?

480
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,750
[ITSUKI]
Both of you.

481
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,791
I don't care whether
it's a man or a woman,

482
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,125
or both from now on!

483
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,375
But this time,

484
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,291
I think the two of you
are the maiden.

485
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,333
I want the three of us
to save Granvania!

486
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
Unless, you can't.

487
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,458
[SEIYA]
Are you kidding, Itsuki?

488
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,125
[NARCISSTES]
We have no choice.

489
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,375
Who could turn you down
when you're this passionate?

490
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,208
This committed to the cause?

491
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,083
Not to mention the fact
that you're...

492
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,708
Obviously sexy.

493
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,291
So, you'll do it?

494
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,750
You'll have my child?

495
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,416
Will we even be able to?

496
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,208
I say we trust and follow
your gut on this.

497
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,333
I agree. I'm in.

498
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,083
Same.
Let's do it.

499
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,333
Here we go, then!

500
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,125
Open the forbidden door!

[ocean waves breaking]

505
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,291
Wow, that was
quite a sight to behold,

506
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,083
and not something
I'll soon forget, either!

507
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
Mana, what just happened?
Were neither of them the maiden?

508
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,125
No, of course
they weren't, silly!

509
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,375
Huh?

510
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,500
The purpose of the ritual
is to procreate.

511
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,375
How could it ever have been
between men?

512
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,750
So, you've been playing me?

513
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,583
Do you think this is
some kind of joke?

514
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,458
No, let me explain, Itsuki!

515
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,041
Basically, we've all just been
watching you level up!

516
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,500
What do you mean?

517
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,250
Well, for you humans,
evolving means opening up.

518
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,875
Becoming more open-minded.

519
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,500
So, you're saying
I've progressed?

520
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,958
I admit, it's been
very fascinating to watch.

521

You knew?

522
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,083
Now you can delve
into your relationship

523
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,333
with the thirteenth maiden
with fresh eyes.

524
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,041
I do see things differently.

Me, too. Now I only picture you
with dudes!

526

You're a stronger person
than you were yesterday.

Granvania thanks you for that.
Truly.

I can't believe
you guys knew all along!

[ITSUKI]
It's not about men.

534
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,625
And it's not about women.

535
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,375
It's about connecting
with another human being

536
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,083
on a real level
and experiencing that bond...

women or men.
