Commence attitude control.

Resume rotation and
establish gyro stability.

All generator satellites
tracking and reorienting.

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,240
Worker vessels also in position.

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,440
‐ Chairman Ronan, Ms. Martha.

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,700
It has been far too long.

15
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,220
‐ What is the Nahel Argama's position?

16
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,980
‐ It's engaging a Neo Zeon fleet

17
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,110
in the vicinity of Industrial 7.

18
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,840
The special operations machine launched

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,790
from the General Revil has also
arrived at the battle line.

20
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,870
‐ I can't say I'm surprised.

21
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,750
It looks like the honeymoon is over

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,270
for the Federation in Neo Zeon.

23
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,470
Chairman Ronan, are you listening to this?

24
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,800
There's no doubt that Laplace's Box

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,590
is located within
Industrial 7's Magallanica.

26
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,530
When ever either party reaches it,

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,880
you know what must be done.

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,820
‐ You have a clear line of fire, sir.

29
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,220
We are ready for your order.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,440
‐ With this act, Laplace's
Box will be lost,

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,960
and a new arc will be born.

32
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,990
That this secret was sealed for good

33
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,580
will be the heinous truth
that cost of a colony.

34
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,130
We will be creating a new Box

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,790
that will allow the collusion between

36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,000
the Foundation and
governments to continue.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,870
‐ [Bright] Did you say Gryps 2?

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,910
‐ Its codename is System.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,440
Apparently, it was repaired

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,540
when they reorganized
the Earth Orbital Fleet.

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,130
If you listen to the rumor mills

42
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,040
the control center is probably located

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,070
at Cheyenne in North America.

44
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,570
Just think if Federation and
Vist Foundation top brass

45
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,890
have gathered there‐‐

46
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,300
‐ Are they intending to
incinerate everything?

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,040
‐ That's my guess.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,440
The Foundation doesn't care about

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
preserving the Box anymore.

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,430
Before they see it handed
over to a third party,

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,640
they would much rather‐‐

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,430
‐ The Nahel Argama is engaged in battle

53
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,920
and I have no means of warning them.

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,800
And from the looks of things

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,720
it may already be too late
to evacuate Industrial 7.

56
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,910
‐ That's a tough decision
you have Captain Bright.

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,620
‐ Attention all hands!

58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,630
Prepare for atmospheric entry!

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,130
Ready the ship for Earth fall.

65
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,410
Black Unicorn right away.

66
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,350
Please, the Banshee is
a dangerous machine.

67
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,980
‐ Stay outta this.

68
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,330
‐ [Man] Leading units have made contact

69
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,530
with enemy mobile suits!

70
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,030
In position and now engaging!

71
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,310
‐ [Liam] What's the Unicorn's status?

72
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,740
‐ [Man] 150 kilometers aft,
still engaging the enemy.

73
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,850
‐ [Man] ECOAS Team, EC‐01,
Mega Bazooka Launcher connected

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,170
to main gun power supply and in position.

75
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,540
‐ [Man] Anti‐air combat
preparations complete.

76
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,009
‐ Fire when ready.

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,690
Enemy suits have breached
our defense line!

Approaching at high speeds!

81
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,850
‐ They've located us.

82
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,634
Anti‐air interception!

Come on, we don't have
time for this nonsense!

00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,070
Full Frontal is going to‐‐

87
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,070
‐ I'm in this mess because of you.

88
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,870
‐ Our suits are attempting
to provoke each other.

89
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,900
I can't hold it back any longer!

90
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,060
‐ You've been holding the Unicorn back?

91
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,160
How much longer do you have to insult me

92
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,570
me before you're satisfied?

93
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,140
I've had enough!

94
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:36,299
‐ [Banagher] Ensign Riddhe don't.

[blasters firing]

97
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,910
Take a good look around you.

98
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,520
There's no reason for us to be fighting.

99
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,245
‐ [Riddhe] That's not true.

100
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:06,078
I have a duty to keep you people‐‐

101
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:07,370
‐ Is that that Ensign Riddhe speaking?

102
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,880
‐ Wait a minute, but why are the Gundams

103
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,720
fighting each other?

104
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,680
‐ [Riddhe] And as a member
of the Martianist family.

105
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,140
‐ [Banagher] No that's just an excuse‐‐

106
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,480
‐ Ensign Riddhe.

107
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,420
Why is he‐‐
‐ You're just a kid

108
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,580
letting the New Type go to your head.

109
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,890
You made a mess of everything!

110
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,770
‐ New enemies detected!

111
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,480
Company size, Rose mobile
suit confirmed, as well!

112
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,726
‐ Is it Lieutenant Angelo?

[guns firing]
[energetic music]

114
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,840
‐ My captain, the King
of the Dispossessed,

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,060
is the only one worthy to hold the Box!

116
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,800
You ignorant fools need
to comprehend that.

117
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,224
You people are a blight and
I'll get rid of you all!

[blasters firing]
[dramatic music]

119
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:29,930
‐ The FCS circuits have been severed.

120
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm heading down to Fire Control.

121
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,170
‐ Bridge, Marida Cruz here.

122
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm launching in the Kshatriya.

123
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,943
‐ Captain!

124
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,190
‐ You have to stop her, Ensign Mihiro!

125
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,020
She's still recovering and
in no shape to be fighting.

126
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,853
Right, Captain?

127
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,000
‐ No, you should let her go.

128
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,190
‐ [Audrey] Zinnerman?

129
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,750
‐ [Zinnerman] We'll position
the Kshatriya to our rear

130
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,090
and keep the Black Gundam occupied.

131
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,130
Then we can send the Unicorn

132
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,660
to deal with the enemies up ahead.

133
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,840
‐ But Lieutenant Marida
isn't in any shape to even‐‐

134
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,540
‐ If we do nothing, we'll
all be killed anyway.

135
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,900
We'll deploy the firepower
of the Full Armor Unicorn

136
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,750
ahead of us to punch our way through.

137
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,780
As they're doing that we can use the

138
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,830
mobile suits' trajectory data to determine

139
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,850
the enemy mother ship's position.

140
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,330
And while the Unicorn has the attention

141
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,450
of the enemy's forces, we slam them

142
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,820
with the mega particle cannon

143
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,670
and sink the Rewloola's escort ships.

144
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,810
‐ [Otto] Marida, did you hear the plan?

145
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,780
Are you up for it?

146
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,813
‐ I am.

147
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,120
‐ [Otto] Don't overdo it.

148
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,360
Neither you nor the
Kshatriya are at 100% yet.

149
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,260
‐ [Marida] I know.

150
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,460
Thank you.

151
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,740
Kshatriya launch.

152
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,920
‐ [Otto] Captain, take the
Chief Gunnery Officer's seat.

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,060
‐ But Captain!

154
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,560
‐ I'm going to need a combat advisor.

155
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,910
Is that all right with you?

156
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,343
‐ Yes.

157
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:51,434
[blasters firing]
[energetic music]

158
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,990
‐ Damn Newtypes.

159
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,100
The subspecies of humanity that embodies

160
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,980
the curse of Laplace's Box.

161
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,870
I'll do whatever it takes to exorcize you,

162
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,280
even sacrifice myself.

163
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:17,320
The Marcenas family may have left curse,

164
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,930
and the Vist Foundation kept it hidden.

165
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,860
As the heirs to each,
if we both disappear,

166
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,270
so will the karma of the past 100 years!

It wasn't intended to
be a curse but a prayer!

If only you Newtypes hadn't come along

we wouldn't be in this mess.

You'll be swallowed by
the machine if you don't.

If I destroy this mutant breed

that's adapted to life in space

177
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,970
losing my soul is a small price to pay.

Don't you see you're a Newtype, too!

Everyone is worried about you.

I'll take care of this one.

You clear a path for the Nahel Argama!

They claim to be devoted to the cause,

213
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,180
but their deficiency has ruined the world.

214

Soon I won't have to, you'll die!

Are you seeing the same
thing we're seeing?

222
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,620
‐ My best guess is those
funnel‐like objects

223
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,200
might be emitting some
sort of jamming signal.

The psycho‐waves that control the psycommu

225
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,220
are technically a type of wave,.

226
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,100
If they slam into even
more powerful waves,

227

it should be possible to negate them.

It's an illusion.

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,940
The psycommu must be

Nahel Argama has breached Neo Zeon line.

341

‐ It's almost time.

342

Begin the preparations.

343
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,390
‐ It's still too soon.

344
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,960
The Box has no meaning in and of itself.

345
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,130
There's no reason for us to act rashly.

346
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,760
We could wait and see what
they intend to do with it.

You don't have to go at this alone.

We've got your back.
‐ Right.

You really didn't have to
come to come with me you know.

‐ I also have a right to see this through.

361

Or rather, I have a duty to.

362

‐ Too many people have died over it.

Whatevers inside it better be
worth all this loss of life.

Mr. Conroy, the Vist Mansion,

370

‐ [Man] Motion detected
inside the habitat.

No change in Magallanica.

The command module seems to be deserted.

‐ No readings from harbor center, either.

375

Communications appear to be cut off.

376
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,940
‐ Done at the behest
of Magallanica's lord,

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,370
the master of the Vist
Foundation, no doubt.

378
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,340
Should we go inside, as well?

‐ Are you serious?

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,180
‐ The Nahel Argama is at her limit.

381
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,130
If we seal the gate behind us,

382
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,640
we can use Magallanica as a shelter.

383
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,150
‐ Just a moment.

384
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,400
I've surveyed the damage.

385
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,290
Under Zeon command, she'd
be deemed fit enough

is still out there.

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,550
And we don't know what Full Frontal's

390
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,480
plan of attack is yet.

391
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,680
Additionally it concerns
me that the General Revil

392
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,240
hasn't turned up yet.

393
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,090
I would keep your ship on standby,

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,340
that way any trouble arises‐‐

At least that's what Lieutenant
Marida's warning was.

This time, it's the adults turn.

399
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,730
It's our chance to protect him.

‐ [Conroy] Banagher, are you there?

403
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,950
Magallanica's rotation
is coming to a stop.

404

What's your status?

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,383
‐ Commander?

‐ I have been waiting

409
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,960
for there is one thing I must tell you.

410
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,040
The offspring of my own flesh and blood

411
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,160
and the princess of
Zeon, one could not find

412
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,690
two other people more fitting to entrust

413
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,109
the contents of Laplace's Box to.

414
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:10,206

Relaying data for analysis.

‐ [Man] Neo Zeon fleet
is hiding in shoal zone.

They are most likely reorganizing
their remaining forces.

421
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,263
Situation remains unchanged.

422
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:33,272
‐ So the seal is about to be broken.

[dramatic music]

424
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:02,068
‐ [Syam] It took a
billion years for the life

425
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:05,340
that arose from the sea
to make its way onto land.

426
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,530
And then it took another billion
years of countless changes

427
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,630
and repeated cycles of
success and struggles

428
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,320
before that life could
ultimately take human form.

429
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,020
That is how evolution works.

430
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,050
It is not something that
can be charted or even felt

431
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,700
within the limited
lifespan of an individual.

432
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,890
However, Newtypes embody an
expansion of cognitive ability.

433
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,920
One in which triggers the reformation

of an individual's consciousness.

435
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,410
The final night of the old calendar.

The instant the Universal Century began,

437
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,460
that's when its first strands were woven.

438
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,843
‐ Wait a minute.

439
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:09,980
That's the Universal
Century Charter monument.

440
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,890
‐ That monument, look right there!

441
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,997
It's different from the one we all know.

442
00:36:20,997 --> 00:36:22,247
It has one extra article.

[gentle music]

444
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,750
It says here, in the
future should the emergence

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,490
of a new space‐adapted
human race be confirmed,

446
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,280
the Earth Federation shall give priority

447
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,790
to involving them in the
administration of the government.

448
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,950
A new human race?
‐ Newtypes?

449
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:25,290
‐ That is Laplace's Box.

450
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,190
This is the truth behind the curse

451

that has cast its spell on
us for the past 100 years.

452

It's Captain Otto.

00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,240
Come back, to the ship.

456
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
You're still a Nahel Argama crew member.

If you can hear us, please respond.

[Mihiro gasping]

Captain Otto.

461
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,710
There was nothing I could do.

462
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,690
No, that's not true.

463
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,730
There were plenty of other options.

464
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,653
So why did I?

465
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,480
Captain, have you wondered
why the Federation

466
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,810
always tries to prove that Zeon is wrong.

467
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,000
They're labeled devils
who dropped a colony.

468
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,580
But that was the result, not
the cause of the problems.

469
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,600
The real issue is the Newtypes.

470
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,590
In the future, should the emergence

471
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,440
of a new space‐adapted
human race be confirmed,

472
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,670
the Earth Federation shall give priority

473
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,720
to involving them in the
administration of the government.

474
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,170
That prayer, woven a 100 years ago,

475
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,390
became a curse the
instant that Zeon Deikun

476
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,050
began proposing his Newtype theory.

477
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,340
‐ Then that must mean‐‐

478
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,160
‐ Ricardo Marcenas, the first
Federation prime minister,

479
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,886
added the article titled Future,

480
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,650
as if he were attempting to atone

481
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,320
for discarding Earth's
overpopulation into space.

482
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,290
But after he was killed,
he was turned into a martyr

483
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,400
for the Federation political system.

484
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,590
The Universal Century
Charter was rewritten,

485
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,260
and that really should
have been the end of it.

486
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,450
If the original charter hadn't fallen

487
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,640
into the wrong hands, into
the hands of Syam Vist,

488
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,890
a terrorist involved in the
assassination, none of this...

489
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:42,030
[gentle music]

490
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,090
‐ [Gael] This is Syam Vist,

491
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,400
the founder of the Vist Foundation,

492
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,160
as well as your great‐grandfather,
Master Banagher.

493
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,390
‐ You've been watching us?

494
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,520
Everything that's happened,
you saw it all yet you didn't‐‐

495
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,437
‐ Banagher.

496
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,000
Syam Vist, you have been using

497
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,860
this secret to extort concessions

498
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,740
from the Federation
government for many years now,

499
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,910
why would you suddenly
want to give that up?

500
00:40:12,355 --> 00:40:16,080
‐ Four years from now,
in the year U. C. 0100,

501
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,460
the autonomy of the Republic
of Zeon will be revoked.

502
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,180
Eventually the name of Zeon,
along with his ideology,

503
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,400
will gradually sink into oblivion.

504
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,910
Likewise the word Newtype
will be forgotten as well,

505
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,980
and the curse of the Box
will return to nothingness

506
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,990
like the prayer it represents.

507
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Without giving in to despair,
and without being stymied,

508
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,090
we can face the God
called possibility again

509
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,700
with this prayer.

510
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,410
However if we miss this opportunity‐‐

511
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,970
‐ But if we do this a
war will break out again.

512
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,803
If this was has been signed

513
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:01,790
by representatives of every nation,

514
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,710
then this monument
carries the weight of law.

515
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,090
If an anti‐government
group like the Neo Zeon

516
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,750
were to get their hands on it,

517
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,440
it'd be the perfect weapon
to bring down the Federation.

518
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,710
If that happens, we'll see
a repeat of the One Year War

519
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,840
and that price is too steep
to pay for a noble idea.

520
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,830
That is why I want to entrust it

521
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,080
to Newtypes like the two of you.

522
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,820
‐ The La+ Program is a
system that was designed

523
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,560
to identify true Newtypes.

524
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,480
Because unlike those of Cyber‐Newtypes,

525
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,440
the psycho‐waves of true Newtypes
are actually immeasurable.

526
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,330
And that's why it is the key
that leads a true Newtype

527
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,720
to the Box, whoever that may be.

528
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,480
That is what the Unicorn Gundam is.

529
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,010
Cardeas Vist was the one behind it all.

530
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,280
He never considered putting you in it,

531
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,110
not even in his wildest dreams.

532
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,520
Although, I'm sure he'd be...

533
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,530
‐ All this for something that trivial?

534
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,030
‐ [Riddhe] He was a very clever man.

535
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,510
Even though he was
blackmailing the government,

536
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,800
using the monuments existence as leverage,

537
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,150
he never made unreasonable demands.

538
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,190
He fostered the development
of Anaheim Electronics,

539
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,160
which was still a start‐up at the time,

540
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,940
he founded the Vist Foundation.

541
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,760
‐ And that's how its
symbiotic relationship

542
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,060
with the Federation began.

543
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,540
And then the two parties maintained it

544
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,450
by aggrandizing and keeping
the the original monument,

545
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,870
Laplace's Box, hidden.

546
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,710
Whatever is actually inside
of it no longer matters

547
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,030
for the Box now symbolizes
the current world order.

548
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,210
‐ In the beginning it was
nothing more than a scandal

549
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,210
to threaten the existing administration.

550
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,310
The Principality of Zeon's
rise to power changed things.

551
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,790
Whether or not Newtypes
actually exist isn't the issue.

552
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,560
The very fact that the Federation

553
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,430
swept that article under the rug

554
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,950
would become the ultimate weapon

555
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,450
for those who believe in Zeon.

556
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,870
They had no choice but to remain silent.

557
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:25,830
It would keep this world
from going to Hell.

558
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,290
And yet, in the end, Hell came anyway

559
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,160
in the form of the One Year War.

560
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,700
The sheer magnitude of the death toll

561
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,580
and then the existence of Newtypes,

562
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,780
which was verified by the war,

563
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,870
gave more weight to the Box's curse.

564
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,580
That's why my father and the others

565
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,590
had no choice but to keep the secret.

566
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
Fearing that another
devastating war would break out.

567
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,110
They chose the path of
making the populace docile

568
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,820
under a warped political system.

569
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,080
But what is this order they've
tried so hard to protect?

570
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,340
I heard her voice.

571
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,470
There's no doubt who I
heard was Marida Cruz.

572
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,240
Until then I didn't even know her name.

573
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,450
But yet, her voice.

574
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,460
We can understand each other.

575
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,810
Human beings have that
possibility within them.

576
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,490
Even though I had sworn to protect her,

577
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,600
I didn't believe in the
person I was protecting.

578
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,750
I've let everyone down.

579
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,022
And now I've lost everything.

580
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:37,689
[Riddhe crying]

581
00:44:50,737 --> 00:44:51,850
A direct hit?

582
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,460
That didn't come from a ship.

583
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,170
It must have been a mobile suit.

584
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,180
‐ Send out an alert.

585
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,590
It might be Full Frontal!

586
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,360
Keep your eyes peeled.

587
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,890
‐ Damn it, Full Frontal.

588
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,421
[soft music]

589
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,410
‐ There is no reason to be concerned.

590
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,180
Magallanica was built in
anticipation of this day

591
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,830
so it can withstand a great deal.

592
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,790
It seems the Black Lion ended
up coming to our aid as well.

593
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,920
‐ Anticipation for what?

594
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,380
‐ I have spent decade after decade

595
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,740
serving as the Box's guardian,

596
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,200
staying far too long in this old body.

597
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,820
And during that time I have
had but one single desire.

598
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,610
If Newtypes in actuality existed,

599
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,240
I wanted to entrust the
Laplace's Box to their care

600
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,790
for I truly believe that
they would be the ones

601
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,990
who would be able to put
the Box to a better use

602
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,780
and reclaim for the world the
future that was meant to be.

603
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,660
And now that technology is being perfected

604
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,300
so that it can touch the
human psyche, the soul.

605
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,710
I want to use it to prove
the existence of them.

606
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,130
And that is my only desire.

607
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,540
There are as many my only desires

608
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,500
as there are human beings in the universe.

609
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,740
You can choose to leave the Box unopened,

610
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,370
or you can even choose to
destroy it if you wish.

611
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,740
And if neither of those
two options satisfy you,

612
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,060
you are even welcome to
strike this old fool dead.

613
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,660
And what might your only desire be?

614
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,200
What do you wish for from
the depth of your heart?

615
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,000
‐ If it's true that Newtypes
are the future of humanity

616
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,060
it's unlikely that current humans

617
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,940
would even be able to identify them.

618
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,570
If that's the case, I
just can't be certain

619
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,570
that either one of us have the
qualities you're looking for,

620
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,030
and I don't know what's best.

621
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,068

[gentle music]

623
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,720
Even so, as a human being, I
want to believe in the future.

624
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,380
In people and the possibility
that humans possesses.

and broadcast system in existence.

629
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,130
Even with all the power and influence

630
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,530
of the Vist Foundation, this
was no small feat to set up.

631
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,280
There is precious little time.

632
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,190
The Federation will do
everything in its power

633
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,850
to try and stop you.

634

Now you must hurry before you...

636

You're about to lock possibility away.

637
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,030
You should keep the
contents of the Box secret.

638
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,840
You could then use it as leverage

639
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,530

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,520
You're nothing merely
made in Char's image.

647
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,120
Everything you do is an
attempt to fulfill his role.

648
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,080
How can you be sure that the
Side Co‐Prosperity Sphere

649
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,650
you speak of isn't simply
a part of your programming?

650
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,160
A man who never believed
in humanity's future

651
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,993
has no right to‐‐

652
00:50:01,993 --> 00:50:04,020
‐ That may have been the case at first.

653
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,540
But I am no longer empty.

654
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,090
It is not I who desired to come here

655
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,760
and see the true contents of
the Box with his own eyes.

656
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,870
So who's desire was it?

657
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,740
Whose thoughts are in this vessel.

658
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,180
I would also like to know
the answer to that question.

659
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,870
But alas I do not.

660
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,640
Syam Vist, patriarch of the Vist family.

661
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,050
As leader of Neo Zeon,

662
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,880
and as one who speaks for all Spacenoids,

663
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,230
I'd like you to place
Laplace's Box in my care.

664
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,450
‐ To be clear, this is not something

665
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,380
that's up for negotiation.

666
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,630
I ask that you do not interfere

667
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,820
as you did during the keys handover.

668
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,770
‐ There very well could be
truth in what you have said.

669
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,250
It may be that the Box
should remain unopened

670
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,140
so that humanity may go on living

671
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,200
in the reality they have always known.

672
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,570
‐ Then why?

673
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,490
‐ Let me explain.

674
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,260
The contents of Laplace's Box
do not belong in the hands

675
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,720
of any individual who would only utilize

676
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,020
its unveiling as a bargaining chip.

677
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,730
Men such as you and I.

678
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,180
Listen to me, Ghost of Char.

679
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,020
The Universal Century will
reach the 100 year mark soon.

680
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,330
It's clear this is no longer our time.

681
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,060
Is it so unthinkable
that the time has come

682
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,360
for us to turn over the
reins to the children?

683
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,900
‐ You believe that these
two are true Newtypes, then?

684
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,780
‐ That is of little consequence.

685
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,510
They followed the path
that led to the Box,

686
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,210
and they have made their decision.

687
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,530
I intend to abide by
whatever their decision is.

688
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,403
‐ As you wish.

689
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,360
I do not care to engage in
any further acts of war.

690
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,980
However, if you will
not accept my request,

691
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,860
I will have no choice but to take

692
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,430
the Universal Century charter by force.

by an unknown psycho‐machine.

the truth to the whole Earth Sphere.

703
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,120
‐ [Geal] Without fail, sir.

704
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,670
But what about you?
‐ Never mind me.

705

You are up against Full Frontal.

Do not let your guard down.

Fall back, that thing is dangerous!

I don't sense any hostility.

A new society, a future

No sign of reinforcements, either.

still, no ordinary machine.

Can't we launch the mobile

emanates from everyone.

it's all for nothing.

what sort of future will
all this give rise to?

758

Then again it's possible
that nothing will change.

It is nothing more than words.

that best suits one's interests.

If the Box is opened,

763
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,210
naturally there will be
some evil for awhile.

764

There might even be a movement
to enforce the decree,

written in the hidden passage.

766
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,840
But it begs the question,

767
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,190
do Newtypes actually
exist in the first place?

768
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,130
And even after all the
debates, discussions,

and investigations have ended

770

they still won't reach a conclusion.

And the whole issue will
be completely forgotten.

protecting this monument

01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,710
Look, Banagher, take a look for yourself.

808
01:04:12,788 --> 01:04:17,788
[exotic music]
[Banagher grunting]

809
01:04:24,863 --> 01:04:27,280
[epic music]

810
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,420
This is the place where it all began.

811
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,240
I take it you can see it as well.

812
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:40,530
In that case, let us travel
together to the end of time.

813
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,363
Come Banagher.

814
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:45,175
[epic music]

815
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,690
Witness it for yourself,

816
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,410
complete nothingness, devoid of light.

817
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,870
Even the passage of time
does not exist here.

818
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,168
This is how the world ends.

819
01:06:28,168 --> 01:06:30,460
A world which has reached
the end of its time.

820
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,130
Struggle against it all you like,

821
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:34,020
but the outcome will not change.

822
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,360
Surely you must understand this.

823
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,660
Hope and possibility are
nothing but fleeting dreams

824
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,520
glimpsed at from the
doorstep of this nothingness.

825
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,360
Illusions that offer no comfort.

826
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,500
They lead people astray and
create meaningless conflict.

827
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,750
Only Newtypes understand this truth.

828
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,090
One shouldn't place
irrational hope in a life

829
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,430
that fades away after its brief existence.

830
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,680
‐ [Banagher] But even so.

831
01:07:02,274 --> 01:07:04,857
[gentle music]

832
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,750
‐ That heat.

833
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,350
The warmth from this light.

834
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,350
Gather up as much as you like.

835
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,790
It will change nothing.

836
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,820
Yes, nothing.

837
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:30,650
‐ [Woman] But this heat it
warms the universe, doesn't it?

838
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,980
‐ I suppose it's time.
‐ Indeed.

839
01:07:35,324 --> 01:07:36,530
The thoughts and ideals you had

840
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:41,500
when you were captain have been heard.

841
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:00,763
‐ This light, it's...

842
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,400
‐ [Full Frontal] It's in your hands now.

843
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,910
Do what you believe you must.

844
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,110
‐ [Riddhe] Banagher.

845
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,360
‐ [Banagher] Ensign Riddhe,
Magallanica is being targeted!

846
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,540
This sector is in danger!

847
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,180
Contact everyone, hurry!
‐ Banagher!

848
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:48,070
‐ Are you sure about this?
‐ Yes.

849
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,240
Let's leave the rest to them.

850
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:55,920
‐ [Bright] Wait a minute.

851
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,510
Do you really intend to fire that thing

852
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,740
with the Nahel Argama still there?

853
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,840
‐ Any damage to the colony
will be kept to a minimum.

854
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,673
‐ But you'll still‐‐

855
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:06,710
‐ This is all to protect
the Federation's interests.

856
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,120
There are times when you
find you must sacrifice

857
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,730
the lives of the few so
that the many might live.

858
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:15,320
Silly me, of course a
military man like yourself

859
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,580
already knows that.

860
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,583
‐ You're wrong.

861
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,970
What's being protected is
the Foundation's interests.

862
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:27,290
Sacrifice the lives of the
few so the many might live.

863
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:30,100
It was one of my father's
favorite sayings.

864
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,590
I couldn't live with myself doing that.

865
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:35,050
That's the reason why I sided with you!

866
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,760
So why are you doing this?

867
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,060
You've always said that you
reject the logic of men,

868
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,200
so why are you doing this?

869
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,033
Why?

870
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,790
Let go of me.

871
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,010
I know you heard it.

872
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:59,080
That voice was unmistakable.

873
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,530
Don't deny it.

874
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,210
‐ You must be suffering
from exhaustion, Alberto.

875
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:12,240
‐ [Man] Report from
System's fire control HQ.

876
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,010
Reaching 95% of critical output.

877
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,530
‐ Chairman Ronan.

878
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,890
If you insist on going through with this

879
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,100
you can consider me an
enemy of the Federation

880
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,530
from this moment forward.

881
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,670
‐ Then I call your bluff.

882
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:31,350
You have a family too do you not?

883
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:34,420
Are you sure that you want to
drag your children into this?

884
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,300
‐ There's one thing I'm pretty sure of,

885
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,470
I would want my children to have

886
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,070
a father they aren't ashamed of.

887
01:10:46,023 --> 01:10:46,856
‐ [Man] Maintain firing attitude

888
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:48,850
via gyro‐stabilizing rotation.

889
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:52,267
‐ [Man] Minor adjustment
of attitude control

890
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:56,040
fully shifted to angular
velocity stabilizers.

891
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,190
‐ Execute.
[alarm sounding]

892
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,020
‐ [Man] System here.

893
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,040
Approval code for firing
order received and confirmed.

894
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,590
‐ [Man] Five minutes until firing.

895
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,766
[multiple men talking at once]

896
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,260
‐ [Man] Auto‐tracking in progress.

897
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:15,190
Final targeting adjustment,
L1 reference coordinates.

898
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:19,934
‐ Ensign Riddhe is out there!

899
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:23,090
‐ [Man] 7‐2‐0, North 7‐4‐4‐1‐8.

900
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:25,590
‐ The one piloting the
Banshee's is Ensign Riddhe.

901
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:28,689
I was the one who approved his request!

902
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:32,667
[alarm sounding]

903
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,403
Why?

904
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,913
Why are you?

905
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,100
‐ [Man] Shadow observed in
the vicinity of Luna II.

906
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,510
Displaying at maximum magnification.

907
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:48,600
It's huge!

908
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,590
Measurements show it to be
object the size of a colony.

909
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,240
‐ Colony laser?

910
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,073
No way.

911
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,200
‐ I hadn't heard anything
about Gryps 2 being repaired!

912
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,250
When did that happen?

913
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,587
‐ Evacuate the Nahel Argama
from this sector right away!

914
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,900
I'll put up a psycho‐field
in front of Magallanica.

915
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,160
‐ Banagher.

916
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,040
‐ Banagher, no

917
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,873
‐ [Man] That's crazy!

918
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:17,540
The properties of a psycho‐field
are completely unknown!

919
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,450
‐ Audrey, you can hear me too, right?

920
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:21,420
I want you to evacuate to Industrial 7

921
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,700
and take Syam with you.

922
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,720
‐ Banagher?
‐ That damn kid.

923
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,200
‐ [Audrey] We're not
leaving, we're staying here.

924
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,200
‐ [Banagher] Audrey!

925
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,130
‐ [Audrey] You're confident
you can do this aren't you?

926
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:38,720
Then go prove it.

927
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,600
And make sure you come back.

928
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,650
Breaking your word will not be tolerated.

929
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,810
‐ She's right, it's
important that you come back.

930
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:48,360
‐ Don't you dare die, Banagher.

931
01:12:49,841 --> 01:12:51,530
Far too many people have died already.

932
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,870
‐ [Haro] Don't die Banagher.

933
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,480
Don't die Banagher.

934
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,390
‐ Banagher, we can go
back to school together.

935
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:57,840
What do you say?

936
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,920
If you're gonna get a job
with the Federation Forces,

937
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,600
you're gonna have to finish high school.

938
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,990
‐ You guys.

939
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:07,160
‐ Let me join you.
‐ Ensign Riddhe.

940
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,430
‐ The Banshee is a psycho‐machine, too.

941
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,020
It could be useful.

942
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,770
The issue of Laplace's Box,

943
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:14,670
it doesn't just involve your family.

944
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,130
The ones who ushered in
the Universal Century,

945
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,270
our ancestors, weren't just discarding

946
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,390
their surplus people into space.

947
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:25,400
They embraced that glimmer of
hope for the distant future

948
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,000
and sent it out as the
greatest a prayer they could.

949
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,230
But will it be turned into
a curse or a possibility?

950
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:35,230
That's the question.

951
01:13:36,415 --> 01:13:38,520
[dramatic music]

952
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,710
There's no harm in knowing the truth.

953
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:44,330
All of us, we were all blessed
when we came into this world.

954
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,800
‐ If they'd told us
that in the first place,

955
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,670
it would've been easier.

956
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,260
‐ It's the same old story,

957
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,210
fathers never say enough to their sons.

958
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,430
Children are always forced

959
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,180
to fill in the blanks on their own.

960
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,340
‐ It's too bad, isn't it?
[dramatic music]

961
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,353
‐ Yeah.

962
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,500
‐ Abort it now.
‐ It can't be done.

963
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,860
It's already approaching critical!

964
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,290
If I abort now, there's no telling

965
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,750
what kind of accident will happen!

966
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,320
Gryps 2 has over 1,000 people on board!

everyone of this secret.

Simply from this context,

1045
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,920
as another human being
who lives in this world.

1046

The Charter of the Universal Century

1047
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,210
was enacted at the dawn
of the Universal Century.

1048
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:26,250
And as I'm sure you all know,

1049
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,740
this monument is the foundation
of the Federation government

believed that the monument

1052
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,630
which was erected within Laplace,
was lost immediately after

1053

it had not been lost.

While a replica was displayed

1056

that we have never seen before.

do you say we get as drink?

1074
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,010
‐ [Audrey] That provision was written

1075

in the chapter entitled Future Deal.

1076

is to seize Magallanica

1084

‐ [Audrey] And they'd be able
to understand each other.

1085
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,520
Zeon Deikun proposed his Newtype theory

1086
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,410
more than 40 years after the
creation of this charter.

1087
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:16,510
I believe that this one article

1088
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,190
which was buried along with the truth

1089
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:22,020
of the Laplace Incident was a prayer,

1090
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,730
an offering to the distant future.

1091
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,290
But that coincidence has transformed

1092
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:30,810
all the good intentions in
this charter into a curse.

1093
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:33,020
What would happen if this one article

1094
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:36,610
were linked to Zeon's Newtype
theory, and gave a new impetus

1095
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:40,120
to the Spacenoid Independence Movement?

1096
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,570
This monument, which
originally did nothing more

1097
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,440
than reveal the truth behind what occurred

1098
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,230
during the Laplace Incident,

1099
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,820
has since become an object of fear.

1100
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:52,280
Something which could topple
the Federation government.

1101
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,060
Fearing its very existence,

1102
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,930
the Federation conspired
with the Vist Foundation,

1103
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,150
which had the monument in its possession,

1104
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:02,220
to keep it sealed away,
calling it Laplace's Box.

1105
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:06,950
While this may have been
a moral transgression,

1106
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:09,500
it was also a decision that had to be made

1107
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,950
in order to maintain peace.

1108
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:16,090
However, since this decision
gave birth to an institution,

1109
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,570
the original intent of the Box was lost,

1110
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:22,340
and the mindset of shunning

1111
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,530
anything resembling Newtypes took root.

1112
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,970
After the nightmare of the One Year War,

1113
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,740
that mindset became the very core

1114
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,290
of the Federation
government's inflexibility.

1115
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:37,650
‐ [Man] Wait, but that
isn't a colony builder.

1116
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,800
It's him.

1117
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,150
He's relaying the
transmission to the Unicorn

1118
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:42,980
by resonating the psycho‐fields.

1119

‐ I want the General Revil
dispatched out there at once.

1120
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,910
We can take care of this.

1121
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:50,470
How many people do you think
will actually comprehend

1122
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,920
the true meaning of this broadcast?

1123
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,920
This will merely rile the extremist

1124
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,360
but will amount to nothing.

1125
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,300
The government simply needs to
say that this is fabricated‐‐

1126

‐ The military will take
the appropriate action

1127
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,710
to handle this, however,
you, a civilian, have no say

1128
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:08,110
in what that action will be.

1129
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,580
‐ It's time to let it go, Aunt Martha.

1130
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:15,190
The magic the Box once held is gone.

1131
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,513
‐ Alberto...

1132
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:20,810
‐ It's really over.

1133
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,360
Come, let's make a fresh start.

1134
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,750
‐ Martha Vist Carbine.

1135
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,780
If you don't mind I have
a few questions for you

1136
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,940
regarding the details of this incident.

1137
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:34,773
Come with me.

1138
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,179
[gentle music]

1139
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:14,791
‐ The choice is theirs to make.

1140
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,740
We have no alternative but to accept it,

1141
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:23,200
because that's what fathers do.

1142
01:23:55,555 --> 01:23:58,138
[gentle music]

1143
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:12,103
‐ Captain.

1144
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,410
‐ [Audrey] In the future
should the emergence

1145
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:31,310
of a new space‐adapted
human race be confirmed,

1146
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:33,670
the Earth Federation shall give priority

1147
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,570
to involving them in the
administration of the government.

1148
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,340
On that last night‐‐
‐ Attention.

1149
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,990
Mobile suits launched
from the General Revil

1150
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:41,823
are headed this way.

1151
01:24:41,823 --> 01:24:43,480
A whole swarm of them.

1152
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,850
‐ [Man] We'll move this
behemoth to a safe zone.

1153
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:48,170
Nahel Argama, do you think
you'll be able to keep up?

1154
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,930
‐ Don't worry about us,
we'll be able to manage.

1155
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:53,470
Just keep going until
this transmission ends.

1156
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,420
We'll do everything possible
keep Her Highness safe!

1157
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,880
‐ We'll be there too.

1158
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,590
Banagher, your job is finally over.

1159
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,450
Laplace's Box has been opened.

1160
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:07,470
Head back to the ship and get some rest.

1161
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:12,110
After all, you're a new entity, Banagher.

1162
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:24,940
Is that a perfected Newtype?

1163
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,000
You're always rushing
into things prematurely,

1164
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,080
but nobody wants the
outcome that you seek.

1165
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,380
Just having the possibility,
should be enough.

1166
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,410
You and I have to go on.

1167
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,660
We still have a lot of things

1168
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,050
left to do in this world don't we?

1169
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:45,540
I'm gonna drag you back here
if it's the last thing I do.

1170
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,373
Banshee!

1171
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:59,490
How are you supposed to be
with Mineva if you become that?

1172
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,980
I'm gonna steal Audrey from you, Banagher!

1173
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,940
‐ [Audrey] Everyone who is
listening to this broadcast,

1174
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:16,540
please discern the truth for yourselves.

1175
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:20,297
Open your eyes and then,

1176
01:26:20,297 --> 01:26:23,123
just as people a century ago did,

1177
01:26:23,123 --> 01:26:25,834
I'd ask you to usher in the next century

1178
01:26:25,834 --> 01:26:29,082
with goodwill in your hearts.

1179
01:26:29,082 --> 01:26:31,982
And believe in the God called possibility

1180
01:26:31,982 --> 01:26:34,649
that lies dormant within us all.

1181
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:07,853
‐ [Banagher] Audrey.

1182
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:10,686
[energetic music]

1183
01:27:31,743 --> 01:27:35,576
[singing in foreign language]
