this is the only break they'll get.

have a chance to talk, you and I.

47
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,580
What do you say, Banagher Links?

48
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,390
‐ Do you believe it's possible

49
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,730
that we, the people of Neo
Zeon and the Federation,

50
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,280
will be able to work together?

51
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,790
Even when Laplace's box
is within our reach?

52
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,370
Banagher, you know, when I was on Earth,

53
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,440
I saw so many new things:

54
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,170
things I had heard about.

55
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,440
But to see them for myself is different.

56
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,930
It's only after experiencing them

57
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,530
does a person realize something.

58
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,410
I know now how ignorant
I was about the world.

59
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,450
‐ It was the same for me.

60
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,360
I felt and saw new things, too.

61
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,820
Then it hit me.

62
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,360
It's hard to work together.

63
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,420
Even if people try to
understand each other,

64
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,860
we can't escape from
what we were born into,

65
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,170
and the obligations it brings.

66
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,620
And yet we still ...

67
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,480
Cardeas Vist fought it.

68
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,690
He wanted Laplace's Box opened anyway.

69
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,510
‐ I want to believe it, too.

70
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,160
That people are good.

71
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,750
‐ The final coordinates
of Laplace's Box are ...

72
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,650
‐ [Soldier] Object detected!

73
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,483
It's a ship!

74
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,316
Checking registry.

75
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,890
‐ [Soldier] That's the ship
that attacked the Garuda,

76
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,723
no doubt about it.

77
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,910
Where is it been hiding
out these past two days?

78

‐ Attention, camouflaged
Sleeves freighter.

79
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,750
Halt immediately.

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,140
I repeat, camouflaged Sleeves freighter.

81
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,900
Heave to immediately.

Attention, camouflaged Sleeves freighter.

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,310
Heave to immediately.

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,400
I say again.

85
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,270
Heave to immediately.

Geez, he's still mad over being knocked

89
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,190
into the ocean by the Unicorn.

90
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,009
‐ I'll make that thing stop.

[blasters firing]

92
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,360
‐ It's far too quiet.

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,770
Watts!

94
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,830
Come back.

95
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,430
Get away from that thing, hurry!

96
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,502
Watts, Watts!

97
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,070
‐ This is all your fault.

98
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,170
You were the one who provided the Unicorn

99
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,730
with the means to escape.

100
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,450
You were lured all the way

101
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,270
to the opposite side of the Earth.

102
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,769
I'll bet the Nahel Argama
and the main Neo Zeon fleet

103
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:07,930
are probably well on their
way to the moon by now

104
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,410
thanks to what you've done.

105
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,280
‐ I admit that things did not unfold

106
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,950
as I had anticipated.

107
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,510
I didn't think Full Frontal
would act so quickly,

108
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,690
nor capture the Nahel Argama.

109
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,780
My actions backfired.

110
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,650
‐ How does one lose track of a force

111
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,380
large enough to drive
away the General Revil.

112
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,010
‐ Due to the clandestine nature

113
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,640
of the General Revil's mission,

114
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,950
the fleets that normally
patrol the Earth's surroundings

115
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,790
were conveniently
withdrawn from that area,

116
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,410
a decision that I'm sure
was influenced by pressure

117
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,870
from a civilian entity.

118
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,215
Miss Martha, why would Neo
Zeon resort to such measures?

119
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,580
And what exactly is this Laplace's Box?

120
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,860
‐ Do you know about the tapestry

121
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,110
that has been handed down for generations

122
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,300
in the Vist Family?

123
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,220
The chest in it is
guarded by a white unicorn

124
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,840
and a black lion.

125
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,220
If they can't protect
it, we'll obliterate it.

126
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,870
The Londo Bell's services
will no longer be required.

‐ I see.

130
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,600
‐ I was just getting used
to the controls, too.

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,130
It's a shame since I finally felt

132
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,560
like I could fill Gilboa's shoes.

133
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,070
She somehow fit in

134
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,970
and she was a part of the Garencieres.

135
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,430
How many years has it
been since you pulled her

136
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,620
out of that cesspool?

137
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:11,690
At this point she's probably
closer to us than our own...

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,300
my plan was to wait for
a chance to hijack it.

142
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,230
But now I could care less about that.

143
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,163
If you're alive,

‐ Ridiculous.

153
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,910
They actually stand the mobile
suits upright like this?

154

‐ Yeah, only people whose souls

155
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,436
have been bound by gravity
would think to do that.

I did come up with some
ideas for the Unicorn Gundam

167
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,980
if you're interested.

168
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,810
I mean the Unicorn has stored in it

169
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,400
all the data for the battles it fought

170
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,430
since Industrial 7, doesn't it?

171
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,160
So if I can analyze it
and work my magic then ...

172
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,993
Banagher?

173
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,350
‐ [Soldier] Hold up on any
work around the cockpit area.

174
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,530
‐ With all that's going on,

175
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,920
we have no way of knowing who the Unicorn

176
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,970
will be fighting after we've enhanced it.

177
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
‐ Mr. Takuya?

178
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,640
I was wondering how Miss Micott was doing.

179
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,730
I haven't seen her at all

180
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,480
since we've been on board the ship.

181
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,700
‐ She's running errands for
Mr. Gibney in the engine room.

182
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,650
You know, she's really been on
edge since all this started.

183
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,210
‐ And you?

184
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,140
How are you holding up?

185
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,380
‐ Yeah, I'm okay.

186
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,680
So what are you gonna do now?

187
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
I mean you already know the
coordinates to Laplace's Box.

188
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,730
It's gonna be impossible for you

189
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,370
to keep them hidden forever.

190
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,000
Those sleeves are playing nice for now

191
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,950
but who knows how long it'll last?

192
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,030
‐ [Man] Bridge, we have a
situation in the engine room.

193
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,480
It's an emergency.

194
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,313
‐ No way!

195
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,520
Over my dead body!

196
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,160
You're not getting past me.

197
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,580
‐ What's going on here?

198
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,310
‐ Chief Engineer Sydow.

199
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,510
‐ Commander Liam, I've had enough!

200
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,530
I want you to get these
people off our ship right now.

201
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,940
Ridiculous.

202
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,780
When did we hand our
ship over to Neo Zeon?

203
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
‐ Chief Zydow.

204
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:41,320
[guns cocking]

205
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,430
‐ We feel exactly the same way.

206
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,490
‐ Us too.

207
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,950
You can't possibly approve
of what's going on here,

208
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,110
can you, Commander?

209
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,560
‐ The General Revil was sent out here

210
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,290
with the intention to destroy us.

211
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,630
For now our hands are tied.

212
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,350
‐ That's the reason for letting Neo Zeon

213
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,530
occupy the ship?

214
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,360
The enemy of my enemy is not my friend,

215
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,030
and my men shouldn't
have to put up with it.

216
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,480
‐ Those people are strutting around

217
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,720
the Nahel Argama like they own the place.

218
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,240
They even told me I had to let them

219
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,446
station troops in the engine room!

220
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,990
[soldiers muttering]

221
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,070
‐ In honor of all our
comrades who have fallen

222
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,640
at those peoples' hands, we
simply cannot allow this.

223
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,937
‐ Listen up, Neo Zeon, we
want you off of our ship!

224
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:19,964
[agreeing]

225
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:21,034
‐ Who do you think you are?

226
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,185
This is our ship.
‐ Get out of here!

227
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:25,380
‐ What's the meaning of this?

228
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,180
If you are all going to go at it,

229
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,070
why didn't you invite any of us?

230
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,620
‐ Commander Conroy?

231
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,930
‐ Yeah, you ECOAS boys should help, too.

232
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,420
‐ Your commander and a lot of your men

233
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,330
were killed by these people, right?

234
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,340
‐ I think you've made your point.

235
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,880
But if we refuse your demands,

236
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
what are you going to do about it?

237
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,600
‐ Then we'll just throw you
off by force if we have too.

238
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,260
You shot down those
Federation mobile suits

239
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,370
under the pretext of defending us!

240
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,880
‐ What we were defending
was the box's key.

241
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,480
We couldn't care less about what happens

242
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,870
to any of the rest of you.

243
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,440
‐ There's no denying the fact

244
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,340
that you saved us in our time of need,

245
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,050
and we're grateful for that.

246
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,790
But you can't expect us to
welcome you with open arms,

247
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,010
not when you've killed
so many of our comrades.

248
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,940
‐ I assure you, the feeling is mutual.

249
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,190
‐ Angelo.

250
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,600
I won't tolerate any rash behavior.

251
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:25,200
[dramatic music]

252
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,660
If any offense was given, I apologize.

253
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,830
But for the time being we
must rely on one another

254
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,280
in order to survive.

255
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,480
I urge everyone, please calm down.

256
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,280
‐ Tell me, what were
you doing down on Earth?

257
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,240
Things have only worsened since then.

258
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,080
You said it was important.

259
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,021
You said it was something on you could do.

260
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:48,021
[suspenseful music]

261
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,709
[whistling]

262
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,290
‐ Ahem, this is the captain speaking.

263
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,060
I would like your undivided attention.

264
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,450
As you are all aware we have been caught

265
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,860
in the middle of a conspiracy
involving Laplace's Box

266
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,640
and are now fleeing from none other than

267
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,540
our very own Earth Federation forces.

268
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,350
Joining forces with Neo Zeon

269
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,180
was the only way to extricate ourselves

270
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,750
from this unfortunate
situation we were forced into.

271
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,970
I would like to clarify
that we have not surrendered

272
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,340
and the Neo Zeon have no intention
of occupying this vessel.

273
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,320
In order to survive we will
work together with them

274
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,010
for the time being.

275
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,440
I expect all of you to
conduct yourself respectably

276
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,880
and with restraint.

277
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,713
That is all.

278
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,300
‐ You heard the man.

279
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,160
‐ I appreciate your cooperation.

280
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,440
‐ You should know I have no intention

281
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,280
of siding with Neo Zeon,

282
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,480
even if it means being
fired upon by my own forces.

283
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,540
I'll be damned if I allow the Earth Sphere

284
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,220
to be thrown into chaos
again by letting you people

285
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,170
get your hands on Laplace's Box.

286
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,030
‐ That doesn't change
the fact that your ship

287
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,880
has no other means of survival.

288
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,700
Thanks to the decoy
provided by the Garencieres

289
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,180
the Ra Cailum is probably
nearing Luna II right now.

290
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,810
By the time they have turned around

291
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,600
and are able to rendezvous with you,

292
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,790
we will have reached our destination.

293
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,210
‐ The destination?

294
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,400
Smack dab in the middle of a shoal zone.

295
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,690
‐ This shoal zone is all that remains

296
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,680
of the Battle of Loum.

297
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,700
If the purpose is to make us retrace

298
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,730
the trail of mankind's conflicts

299
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,150
in order to convey to us

300
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,640
the significance of obtaining the box,

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,290
well then, it would not be surprising

302
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,860
if the final coordinates led us there.

303
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,120
‐ You've been intercepting the data

304
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,980
from the Unicorn, haven't you?

305
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,100
So you already know the exact coordinates

306
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,490
of the final location?

307
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,630
‐ All we know is that it is
somewhere in that shoal zone.

308
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,310
We were not able to intercept
anything beyond that.

309
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,143
‐ Why not?

310
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:02,250
‐ I suspected it's because
the Unicorn wouldn't let us.

311
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,400
Ever since it chose Banagher as its pilot,

312
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,060
it has been exhibiting abilities

313
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,760
that weren't in its
original specifications.

314
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,230
For the time being why
don't we simply focus

315
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,160
on finding Laplace's Box?

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,590
Besides, the box can serve as a trump card

317
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,370
that may save your lives.

318
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,820
This is probably something
Banagher has already considered.

319
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,580
Sooner‐‐
‐ What's your excuse?

320
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,330
What are you going to do with
the box once you find it?

321
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,950
For a man they call the
Second Coming of Char,

322
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,300
I find it hard to believe

323
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,240
that all you wanna do
is simply revive Zeon.

324
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,260
I think it's about time

325
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,720
you reveal what your real intentions are.

326
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,410
‐ I would like to hear that as well.

327
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:50,288
[suspenseful music]

328
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,690
Well then, Captain, what
are you really after?

329
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,460
We're waiting for your answer.

330
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,770
‐ As you wish.

331
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,590
‐ If you wouldn't mind?

332
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,830
‐ Not at all, no.

333
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,040
What we spacenoids desire most

334
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,690
is the establishment of
our right to self rule.

335
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,500
However, the Federation
will never consent to this.

336
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,330
They know that the instant they do,

337
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,280
the roles of master and
servant would be reversed.

338
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,180
It's obvious, isn't it?

339
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,330
At present, life in the Earth Sphere

340
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,080
is dependent on the
existence of the Seven Sides

341
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,370
and the Moon for energy production,

342
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,000
food production, and
economic activity itself.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,080
The fact is that on its
own Earth is no longer

344
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,480
even capable of feeding the 2 billion

345
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,022
earthnoid mouths it has.

346
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:04,570
Spcaenoids on the other hand

347
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,840
will have no trouble supporting themselves

348
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,110
if they were to sever ties with Earth.

349
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,980
If I was Zeon Deikun,

350
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,160
I would've taken advantage
of this situation.

351
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,910
However, while he may have
been a great philosopher,

352
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,830
a great politician he was not.

353
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,090
Whether it's the Zabi family manipulating

354
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,160
the Zeon ideals in a war for independence,

355
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,040
or the two Neo Zeon wars,

356
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,450
it boils down to the same thing.

357
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,540
Until we abandon the goal of forcing

358
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,300
them to formally acknowledge us,

359
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,980
there will be no victory
against the Federation.

360
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,380
We will strengthen the ties

361
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,210
between the Moon and the seven Sides

362
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,420
and create an economic zone
without the Earth at the center.

363
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,390
That is to say, we shall establish

364
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,259
the Side Co‐Prosperity Sphere.

365
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,280
‐ That actually makes sense.

366
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,170
‐ If all the sides enter
into an economic partnership

367
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,820
and boycott the Earth,

368
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,250
with no economic value,
it will be abandoned

369
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,330
until it withers away into nothingness.

370
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,730
Subsequently, the Federation government

371
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,510
probably won't survive either.

372
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,900
The only entity capable of
acting as mediator for this

373
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,990
is the Republic of Zeon.

374
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,170
Although it may be a Federation puppet,

375
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,980
it has been granted a certain degree

376
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,730
of autonomy from the government.

377
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,270
However, the Federation is scheduled

378
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,020
to revoke the Republic's autonomy

379
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,070
in just four short years.

380
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,350
If it reverts back to being Side 3

381
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,550
and is no longer permitted

382
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,400
to act as anything more
than a local government,

383
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,020
we will never be able to establish

384
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,200
the Side Co‐Prosperity Sphere.

385
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,410
‐ So you are at a crucial junction.

386
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,890
Then the Vist Foundation came forward

387
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,030
and they proposed turning over

388
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,850
Laplace's Box to you, right?

389
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,270
‐ Yes, although I highly doubt

390
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,100
that Cardias Vist had any awareness

391
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,650
of what we were planning.

392
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,750
From the timing of it, I suspect

393
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,850
that he hated the idea
that the controlling

394
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,050
Federation order would be more entrenched

395
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,930
when the Republic was dissolved.

396
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,820
It is common knowledge that it
is the Federation's intention

397
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,250
to eradicate Zeon once the
Republic has been dissolved,

398
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,790
as is evidenced by the Unicorn Gundam,

399
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,240
a device designed to
destroy the Newtype myth.

400
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,020
‐ So then what you truly hope to gain

401
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,960
by obtaining the box is time?

402
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,480
By threatening the Federation

403
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,230
and postponing the
disillusion of the Republic,

404
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,570
you gain the time to create

405
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,680
this Side Co‐Prosperity Sphere of yours.

406
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,560
‐ That is an accurate assessment.

407
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,400
‐ Now that I hear it said
out loud it seems so petty.

408
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,750
You'll establish the
Side Co‐Prosperity Sphere

409
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,640
and exclude the Federation.

410
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,570
Instead of asking for change from those

411
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,810
who have resisted reform,

412
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,730
you choose to ostracize them.

413
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,190
That couldn't be further removed

414
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,670
from the ideals of Zeon Deikun

415
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,550
who trumped of reforming humanity.

416
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,860
And it is also world's
apart from the passion

417
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
and madness of Char who tried to render

418
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,220
Earth uninhabitable and move
all humanity into space.

419
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,290
Now are you sure that
is what you really want?

420
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,760
If this Side Co‐Prosperity Sphere yours

421
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,180
comes to past, the earthnoids will likely

422
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,710
accelerate the redevelopment
of their planet,

423
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,430
an attempt to support
an economy of their own.

424
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,610
It would be a return to the old AD era.

425
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,200
Most likely the new
generation of earthnoids

426
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,490
will grow up in poverty,

427
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,430
will even plot to retaliate
against the spacenoids.

428
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,513
Familiar?

429
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:16,050
It's just like when Zeon
started the One Year War.

430
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,590
No harmony or reform.

431
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,210
Only the strong and weak endlessly

432
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,480
trading places for eternity.

433
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,640
Is that what a man who
decided to reveal himself

434
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,630
to the world again really wants?

435
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,670
‐ I can imagine how you
must feel, Your Highness.

436
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,980
But this is not a matter
of what's right or wrong.

437
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,390
It is merely how the world operates.

438
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,470
A vessel does not think for itself.

439
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,720
It acts in accordance
with the collective will

440
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,330
that has been poured into it.

441
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,070
It does this to ensure
humanity's survival.

442
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,910
‐ You talk like it doesn't affect you.

443
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,400
But you're talking about
your own people's feature

444
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,920
and what you're saying sounds cold

445
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,320
and detached like you're
somehow not part of it.

446
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,050
The light that enveloped
the Unicorn Gundam

447
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,640
that last time was warm,

448
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,500
like it somehow held all the feelings

449
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,600
of everyone I know.

450
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:20,730
What if that kind of
possibility is inside humans?

451
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,840
‐ I've also seen that same light before.

452
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,660
But the light was even larger.

453
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,380
I suspect that it may have been the result

454
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,710
of gathering the
subconscious of every human

455
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,250
in the Earth Sphere via the psycho frame

456
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,130
and converting it all into energy.

457
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,900
It was a psycho field that
deflected the asteroid Axis.

458
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,860
‐ The Axis Shock?

459
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,430
‐ Yet even when they faced
such overwhelming possibility

460
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,620
people still did not change.

461
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,440
To maintain the status quo,

462
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,710
humans will sweep even
possibility under the rug.

463
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,280
It's what they do.

464
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,240
All we can do is hope to find peace

465
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,560
and stability given that reality.

466
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,350
And what's more you should be aware

467
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,160
that this possibility that you speak

468
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,280
so fondly of has been the
trigger for many a war.

469
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:18,410
‐ The Char Aznable that I knew

470
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,730
truly is dead.

471
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,670
It is at Industrial 7.

472
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,480
It is the colony builder, Megalonica.

473
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,010
That is the final set of coordinates

474
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,910
given by the Laplace Program.

475
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,313
‐ Oh.

476
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,550
‐ The burden was too heavy
for that boy to bear.

477
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,550
‐ I'd like you to kindly
confirm this, if you would?

478
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,363
Thank you.

479
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:59,800
I'll be going back to
the Rewloola for a bit.

480
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,940
I would like you to join me, Captain.

481
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,420
I'm leaving you in charge here, Angelo.

482
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,173
‐ Sir!

483
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:12,059
[engines shutting off]

00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:16,135
[hatch opening]

485

486
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
from getting their hands on the box,

487
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,340
the Vist Foundation and
Federation Government's interests

488
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,550
are completely aligned.

489
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,820
In the face of that threat,

490
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,570
the continued existence of the box

491
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,010
is no longer of vital importance.

492
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,490
The Banshee is a machine
that was originally created

493
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,500
to be manned by Cyber Newtypes.

494
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,380
‐ Banagher was able to master his.

495
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,790
I'm sure I'll do the same.

496
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,030
‐ There's just one more thing.

497
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,550
It's a favor.

498
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,220
I would like for you to recover Ple 12,

499
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,120
the Cyber Newtype abducted by the slaves.

500
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,430
As to why I'll keep that to myself.

501
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,630
Now, I went to considerable lengths

502
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,690
to recommend you as the
Banshee's pilots, Ensigne Riddhe.

503
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,200
That's because I trust you
to carry out this request

504
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
without informing my aunt or her cronies.

505
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,770
In the event that you and the Banshee

506
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,680
are unable to destroy the Unicorn,

507
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,250
then the Vist Foundation will be forced

508
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,010
to use its final option.

509
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,020
Should that happen
everything will be lost,

510
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,640
and I highly doubt that's something

511
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,650
you would want to transpire.

512
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,160
‐ What you're talking about would mean

513
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,420
killing your own half brother.

514
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,470
You would do that?

515
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,880
‐ The road we're headed
down is already bloodied.

516
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,450
It was an accident.

517
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,030
Well, no it wasn't really.

518
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,810
Truth be told, the members of my family

519
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,540
have a history of killing one another.

520
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,670
One of the reasons why my
Aunt Martha became so callous

521
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,330
is because her father, my grandfather,

522
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,910
was killed by Siam Vist,
our great grandfather.

523
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,860
"Revenge against a world
ruled by the logic of men."

524
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,030
Her words, not mine.

525
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,980
Nevertheless not something
a man could easily abide by.

526
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:27,740
But then again perhaps this world

527
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,550
ought to be given a clean slate.

528
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,632
[boosters firing]

529
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,420
Although a species that would create

530
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,710
demons like Unicorn and the Banshee

531
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,450
is probably standing on the
threshold of destruction anyway.

532
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,926
[beeping]

533
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:38,907
‐ Banagher.

534
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:40,324
Visitor, visitor!

535
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,240
‐ Miss Marida?

536
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,370
Should you be out of your‐‐

537
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,203
‐ Here.

538
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,500
Help me finish these off.

539
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,560
They taste awful.

540
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,960
They're supposed to help
patients with their recovery

541
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,120
but I can't stomach them.

542
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,953
‐ Banagher, help help!

543
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,971
They taste awful.

544
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,300
‐ You're right, it's disgusting.

545
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,880
‐ I told you.

546
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,650
‐ Miss Marida, what kind of
foods do you normally like?

547
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,140
‐ Why do you ask?

548
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,690
‐ I'd rather know what you
like than what you hate.

549
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,900
‐ I've never really thought about it.

550
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
‐ Well, what do you think taste good?

551
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,210
There has to be something.

552
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,151
Like something sweet maybe?

553
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:29,984
‐ Do you think?

554
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,067
Do you think?

555
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,930
‐ Let me think.

556
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,560
Ice cream.
‐ All right then.

557
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,200
I know a great ice cream
parlor at Industrial 7.

558
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,921
We can ...

559
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:40,754
Oh.

560
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,770
‐ Those things the Captain
said, he's right, huh?

561
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,730
‐ Yeah, probably but
it's always like that.

562
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,520
And yet it doesn't matter.

563
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,000
Everything ultimately still
just blows up in my face.

564
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,100
It doesn't matter how hard I try or fight.

565
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,230
However, if it weren't for your efforts

566
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,080
I wouldn't be sitting here
talking to you like this.

567
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,390
You know, the way you feel isn't wrong.

568
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,770
Trust in the possibility that lies within.

569
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,880
And try with all your might,

570
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,030
do what you feel is correct.

571
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,730
That belief isn't a curse.

572
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,040
The one who told you that
probably lived that way

573
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,840
following that tenant,

574
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,610
never knowing if it was true.

575
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,580
Simply believing it was right.

576
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,440
‐ But that's so irresponsible of him.

577
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,490
He couldn't do what he wanted on his own.

578
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,090
‐ That might be true.

579
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,690
But still, even so.

580
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,350
He was lucky to be able
to entrust his dream

581
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,820
to someone who wasn't a stranger.

582
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,620
This is how the world progresses
one tiny bit at a time.

583
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,510
If you hold on to your dreams,

584
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,710
if you never give up, if you
don't become close minded.

585
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,840
I know your chance will come.

586
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,440
When it does, don't hesitate.

587
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,870
Get into the Gundam.

588
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,220
Princess.
‐ Are you feeling better?

589
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,053
‐ Yes.

590
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,421
‐ Forgive me, Marida.

591
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:21,900
I ...

592
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,380
‐ I hope that you, Princess,
can follow your heart, too.

593
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,100
‐ I told Mr. Conway what we're up to

594
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,400
and he said to be careful.

595
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,270
‐ Since we don't have
the support of the ship

596
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,320
we'll proceed as is.
‐ Right.

597
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,590
IF we use as our opening

598
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,810
we'll be able to drive them off the ship.

599
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,643
‐ Hey, Micott.

600
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,130
What do you think of that Zeon girl?

601
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,110
Do you think she's planning
on doing something?

602
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,380
I mean she did give Full
Frontal the box's coordinates.

603
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
0 It was to throw 'em off guard.

604
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,280
‐ Are you sure?

605
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,040
‐ Whenever a woman lies,
my skin gets tingly,

606
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
and she means business.

607
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,360
‐ I don't understand women at all.

608
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,260
‐ What are you doing?

609
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,490
‐ That thing doesn't have legs.

610
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,790
‐ If it weren't for the General
Revil's surprise attack,

611
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,840
you would have hijacked the Nahel Argama

612
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,410
with or without us, am I right, Captain?

613
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,630
‐ That's what you
brought me down here for.

614
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,370
‐ Does it seem meaningless now?

615
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,250
For all those years you clung
on to that hatred of yours,

616
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,350
never being able to get rid of it.

617
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,690
But now you have other dreams.

618
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,110
Was it the boy who somehow changed you

619
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,470
or was it Lt. Marida?

620
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,430
‐ I couldn't let go of this hatred

621
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,010
even if I'd wanted to.

622
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,100
But I wouldn't exactly
call it meaningless now.

623
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,950
I suppose I'm tired,

624
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,150
tired of huddling in the darkness,

625
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,470
of the me who has given up on everything.

626
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,780
It makes me wonder.

627
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,450
Back then when Char Aznable chose

628
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,980
to create the world of Newtypes
that his father dreamed of

629
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,700
instead of seeking revenge
against the Zabi family,

630
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,350
I wonder if maybe he was in the same

631
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,110
state of mind as I am in right now.

632
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,010
‐ If by chance Char Aznable

633
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,380
happen to still be alive today,

634
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,040
I think there's a possibility that

635
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,300
he would no longer be entirely human.

636
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,300
Go ahead.

637
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,740
‐ [Soldier] Captain, we've detected a ship

638
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,760
heading this way.

639
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,960
It appears to be a
Federation patrol vessel.

640
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,110
‐ [Soldier] This is Patrol Vessel El Faro

641
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,670
with the L1 Patrol.

642
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,900
Londo Bell vessel, Nahel Argama,

643
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,550
we have received your distress signal.

644
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,800
Please respond.

645
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,699
‐ What are they talking about?

646
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:57,940
How did they get a distress signal?

647
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,028
We didn't send one.

648
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,797
It's just one ship and yet ...

649
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,520
Ensign Mihiro.
‐ Sir!

650
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,850
‐ Get rid of them as quickly as you can.

651
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,330
The Neo Zeons will not sit idly by

652
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,890
if you let that ship hang around.

653
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,870
‐ Understood.

654
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,550
‐ [Soldier] Londo Bell
vessel, Nahel Argama.

655
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,130
Respond at once.

656
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,560
Wait a minute.

657
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,870
We're detecting Neo
Zeon vessels around you.

658
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,488
Two Musaka class, one Rewloola class.

659
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:23,220
Both are transmitting
Federation forces IFF codes.

660
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,680
Requesting an explanation.

661
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,500
If necessary we will go to combat alert.

662
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,680
Please respond.

663
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,230
Londo Bell vessel, Nahel Argama,

664
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,630
state your mission and your destination.

665
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,670
I say again‐‐
‐ Your orders, sir?

666
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,790
‐ Blow them out of the sky, Captain.

667
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,240
‐ [Soldier] Why are you not responding?

668
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,410
‐ Hurry up and give the order to attack.

669
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,470
‐ Don't be ridiculous.

670
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,440
That ship is one of ours.

671
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,010
‐ If you don't, they will
call for reinforcements.

672
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,590
What will your chances be then?

673
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:56,860
You will take responsibility.

674
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,980
It seems some misguided
souls aboard your ship

675
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,640
have put our joint front at risk.

676
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,736
‐ You mean they sent
out a distress signal?

677
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,910
‐ We could easily fire
on them from our ships

678
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,780
but this is your mess so
you should be the ones

679
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,750
to clean it up.

680
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,620
If you refuse to attack
we'll take it to mean

681
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
that you are dissolving our joint front.

682
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:26,610
It's your decision, yours alone, Captain.

683
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,910
‐ [Soldier] If you continue
to maintain radio silence,

684
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,193
we will deal with you‐‐
‐ This can't be happening.

685
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:35,193
[suspenseful music]

686
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,680
‐ Make your decision quickly.

687
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,540
You have civilians aboard this ship!

688
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:01,244
‐ I dare you to lay a finger
on a single one of them.

689
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,530
If you do I'll rip your head off, boy!

690
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,120
You people are no soldiers.

691
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,950
You're nothing but a bunch of terrorists,

692
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,450
and I do not negotiate with terrorists.

693
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,660
Any arrangement we've had
with your people is now over.

694
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,190
‐ Yeah, you tell 'em, Captain.

695
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:25,253
[guns firing]

696
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,000
‐ You bastards!

697
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,612
[groaning]

698
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,330
‐ Explain our situation
to the patrol ship.

699
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,510
Have them get clear.

700
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,780
‐ Roger!

701
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,030
‐ How dare they while
the Captain's not here!

702
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,440
‐ What should we do?

703
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
‐ Why are you asking me?

704
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,300
To the mobile suit deck.

705
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,590
We'll go secure the
Garancieres team's suits.

706
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,130
‐ Fleet members are headed towards

707
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,991
the mobile suit deck.
‐ That you, Banagher?

708
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:19,263
Get down to the mobile suit deck.

709
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:20,460
‐ [Soldier] Seal off designated air locks.

710
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,000
‐ Get into the Gundam
and smash the cockpits

711
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,960
of all the Neo Zeon mobile suits.

712
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,090
We'll keep unnecessary
combat to a minimum.

713
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,263
‐ Right.

714
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:30,060
‐ And Banagher ...

715
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,000
Be careful.

716
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,130
The commander saved your life
so you better not waste it.

717
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,120
You got that?

718
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,335
‐ Got it!

719
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:43,335
[suspenseful music]

720
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:49,436
[guns firing]

721
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,630
‐ [Conroy] Don't let those Neo
Zeon bastards off the ship.

722
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,550
We can use them as hostages
against the Rewloola.

723
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,010
‐ [Soldier] Engine block secured!

724
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,240
‐ [Soldier] Two hostiles have escaped

725
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,310
towards the bow of the ship.

726
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,440
‐ [Soldier] What is the current status

727
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,510
of the mobile suit deck?
‐ Mobile suit deck here.

728
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,565
Still engaging enemy forces.

729
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:06,506
Requesting reinforcements.

730
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:07,986
‐ [Soldier] Hangar controls secured.

731
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:08,895
We're getting repaired.

732
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,823
‐ [Soldier] Whatever happens,
do not let the enemy pilots

733
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,895
reach their mobile suits!

734
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:15,395
[guns firing]

735
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,420
‐ This is as far as you'll get.

736
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,270
I suggest you not try anything foolish.

737
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,180
Now that we know where the box is located

738
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,630
we no longer have an incentive
for keeping you alive.

739
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,950
We could destroy the Unicorn as well.

740
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,050
Why do you refuse us?

741
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,450
If the Federation gets a hold of the box

742
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,130
it will ensure the continuation

743
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,000
of the current flawed system.

744
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,070
Isn't that in direct conflict
with your late father

745
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,270
whose last wish was to
bring about reformation?

746
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,140
Only Zeon has the ability to use the box

747
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,230
to grant the abandoned spacenoid people

748
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,420
their long cherished dream.

749
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,050
What can you do?

750
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,480
How are you planning to
utilize Laplace's Box?

751
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,260
‐ There's one thing I do know.

752
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,110
I would use it for everyone.

753
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,920
Not just Federation, not just
for Zeon, space or earth.

754
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,340
I'd use Laplace's Box for everyone.

755
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:23,301
‐ Captain!

756
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,300
‐ And what exactly do
you mean by everyone?

757
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,260
One man cannot be the voice

758
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,950
for the wishes of the entire human race,

759
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,030
not unless he becomes a vessel.

760
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,610
But to become a vessel he
must release everything

761
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,210
and go beyond his own madness

762
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,120
and emerge from the other side.

763
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,900
That is no simple accomplishment.

764
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,420
Still, you do possess talent.

765
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,630
If you truly wish to become a vessel,

766
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,340
then come with me.

767
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,980
You've been entrusted
with your father's dreams

768
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,450
and forced to undergo training
not unlike a Cyber Newtype.

769
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,690
Now that you have
exhibited the power of one,

770
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,950
you can never go back to
being a part of that everyone.

771
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,340
One day you will run headlong

772
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,760
into the same despair that I did.

773
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,540
‐ [Marida] Keep telling
yourself even so Banagher.

774
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:21,390
‐ Just die already!

775
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,200
‐ [Mineva] Withdraw your
forces, Full Frontal!

776
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,840
We do not choose to walk
the same path as you.

777
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,910
‐ Audrey!

778
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,260
‐ [Mineva] The second
coming of the Red Comet.

779
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,830
There was a time when we
clung to your strength.

780
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,840
We were being hounded by the Federation

781
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,010
and we had nothing else to hold on to.

782
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,270
But you are not Char.

783
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,960
The Char Aznable that I knew

784
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,510
was a man who believed
in human possibility!

785
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,550
‐ Why do you insist on refusing to accept

786
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,880
the Captain's ideas?

787
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,080
[groans]

788
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,390
Garancieres team,

789
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,830
officers and soldiers of
Neo Zeon, listen to me.

790
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,480
Whatever Laplace's Box turns out to be

791
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,370
it will mark a profound
turning point for us.

792
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,500
It may even be capable of bringing about

793
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,890
the future that Full Frontal speaks of.

794
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,390
He may be correct.

795
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,010
It may be the only
realistic option that exists

796
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,920
to ensure humanity's survival.

797
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,420
However, do you truly want
to make that the future?

798
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,490
Isn't the future supposed
to refer to a time

799
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,960
that is different from the present?

800
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,500
A world that is better
than the one we have now?

801
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,170
The harmony and human evolution

802
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,870
that Zeon Deikun dreamt of

803
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,140
do not exist in that future world.

804
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,010
As successors to those who brought about

805
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,810
the tragedies of the One Year War,

806
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:42,240
we have not only
inherited the name of Zeon

807
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,460
but we have inherited responsibility.

808
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,630
If we simply accept the
status quo as a fixed reality,

809
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,240
we cannot fulfill that responsibility.

810
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,080
The light the Unicorn showed us...

811
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,210
‐ [Zinnerman] Marida
Cruz, open your cockpit.

812
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,660
‐ Marida, don't!

813
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,450
‐ How can the last Sazabi
heir say such a thing?

814
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:13,395
‐ Audrey!

815

‐ That's enough.

816
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,980
Come out of your cockpit and
bring the Princess with you.

‐ Marida, snap out of it.

Marida!

819
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,240
Zinnerman, are you still
a prisoner of your past?

820
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,730
You have Marida now.

821
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,730
Take responsibility and
live in the present.

822
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,560
Things were different ever since that day

I couldn't do anything.

828
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,800
They must have been so scared.

829
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,040
It's so much pain.

830
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,310
And I did nothing.

you let me have my way?

This will be my final order to you.

This is how you always act!

Irresponsible.

845

Weak!

846

That is why ...

847
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,090
We need something more
powerful than humanity,

848
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,340
and the Captain has transcended humanity.

849
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,820
‐ It's humanity's future.

850
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,750
So shouldn't it be built by humans?

851
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,180
It's true, people are weak and flawed.

852
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,680
That's why we need each other.

853

We pass all our dreams to one another

854

Well, what do you think we should do now?

‐ If I asked you to put
me out of my misery,

would you be willing to do it?

Besides, there's still a whole mess

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,140
that needs to be done
by me and you, Captain.

We have just set a course for Industrial 7

00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,740
to carry out our mission.

886
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,760
That mission is to locate
and secure Laplace's Box.

887
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,600
Although it may seem like we have returned

888
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,350
to our original assignment,

889
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,120
this mission is not being conducted

890
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,190
on orders from the military.

891
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,110
We do it to survive.

892
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,330
We are conducting this operation
under our own auspices.

893

We cannot allow the box to
fall into Full Frontal's hands,

whether it be his Side

or the future Princess Mineva described.

The crux of the conflict
is humanity's potential.

897
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,400
Of these two I do now know
which path is correct.

898
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,540
But we will not be the
ones to make this decision.

899
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,550
Rather it will be our children,

the youth who are alive today,

901

and their children, the youth
that are yet to be born.

902

And in order to entrust
this choice to them

903
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,900
we must return from this alive.

904
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,210
We must return with the box in hand

905
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,000
and then let the world face the truth.
