00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,050
Object ball has been placed
in pyramid spot, sir.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,140
‐ Attention!

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,980
Initiate Phase Three.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,480
This ship will now breach enemy

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,060
airspace at maximum combat speed.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,870
We will launch a hyper
mega particle cannon attack

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,230
against the Neo Zeon stronghold.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,630
This one strike will determine

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,710
the success of the entire mission.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,399
I expect all crew members
to be at their best.

12

[dramatic suspenseful
music with heartbeat]

13
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:15,280
‐ Nashiri Team is proceeding to Phase Two.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,730
‐ [Captain] Good. Proceed
to target extraction point.

15
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,840
On my mark.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,850
I'll wait until Banagher
Links has been retrieved.

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,420
Once I have confirmation,

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,110
we'll join with Team Alpha
to recapture the Gundam.

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,880
‐ This will be a
strike‐and‐fade operation.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,500
After the advance team has separated

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,900
Palau's four asteroids,

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,710
we'll fire the hyper mega particle cannon

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,550
to seal off the military port.

24
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,570
The plan is to retrieve Banagher Links

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,880
and the Unicorn during the confusion.

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,630
‐ So then, you will only attack
Palau's military facilities?

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,260
‐ Yes. The Federation
has spies there, too.

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,200
Do you really think that we'd risk

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,020
endangering the residential block?

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,070
That look on your face

31
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,770
says thar you'll go back and
warn them if you have to.

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,060
Guess you'll just have to trust me.

33
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,172
‐ [P. A. System] Commence
at 2200 hours to the

[dark music muffles intercom]

‐ We may be at our closest point in orbit,

36
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,120
but it's still two days to Earth.

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,830
I could only scrounge up a
little bit of food and water.

38
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,110
‐ I'm prepared to do what I must.

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,630
‐ What's going on, Mr. Ensign?

40
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,540
Were you helping her escape?

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,410
I mean, isn't she a prisoner of war?

42
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,297
‐ Hold on!

43
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:33,047
I know what this looks like, but...

44
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,277
‐ Ensign Riddhe!

45
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:40,360
The Ensign and I are going to Earth.

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,540
Just because he's
accompanying me does not mean

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,690
in any way that he's a traitor.

48
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,180
He's not betraying you or the Federation.

49
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,500
I realized that given my
current circumstances,

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,770
there is something that only I can do.

51
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,040
Likewise for Ensign Riddhe.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,870
‐ Like I could believe
anything from the mouth

53
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,410
of the Zeons' princess!

54
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,180
‐ This is a very important matter.

55
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,370
To prevent this conflict
from escalating further,

56
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,930
I have no choice but to go.

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,510
Ms. Micott ‐‐

58
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,510
‐ Don't assume this means I forgive you.

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Let's say you owe me one.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,370
Now go to the Earth and do
whatever you have to do.

What's with these last minute orders?!

64
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,560
I don't understand,

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,710
you just got home!

66
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,870
‐ Don't you worry, I'll be fine.

67
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,730
Just look after the family for me.

68
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,996
‐ O‐Okay...

69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,640
‐ The kid made a run for it, huh?

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,630
‐ My apologies, Master.

71
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,800
‐ He won't be able to get off Palau.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,990
Still, I may have underestimated him.

We're about to enter enemy airspace!

Inertial flight.

79
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,420
Transfer all power to the
hyper mega particle cannon!

80

‐ Disperse Minovsky
particles at combat density!

‐ Hyper mega particle
cannon, ready to fire!

‐ Prepare to attack once we've
reached the designated point!

85
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,870
And remind all friendly suits to stay

clear of our line of fire!

Bridge to all mobile suits.

00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:07,910
It's the Nahel Argama!

171
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:16,812
Come on...

172
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,750
Come on, hurry!

173
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:33,970
You have to let me go!

174
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:37,447
If you don't, the Federation
will keep attacking!

175
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,980
Do you want to turn Palau
into a battlefield?!

176
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:51,582
Why?!

177
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,730
Why wouldn't you listen?

178
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,450
‐ Did we walk into a trap?

179
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,850
‐ You had better go.

180
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,450
You have an obligation to help your team.

181
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,790
‐ But I'll be fighting your own forces.

182
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,660
‐ Don't worry.

183
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,100
That's not your concern.

184
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,480
You can't turn your back on them now.

185
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,430
Follow your heart.

186
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,630
If you don't, you'll regret
it for the rest of your life.

187
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,540
You know that.

188
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,060
‐ You got me.

189
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
I'll break away once our forces withdraw.

190
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,800
Sorry, but you're with me until then.

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,633
‐ All right.

192
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,960
‐ That should give you an excuse!

193
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Now go home!

194
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:58,290
‐ [Princess] Here comes another one.

195
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:03,932
That's the Unicorn Gundam!

196
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:04,932
‐ But who...

197
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:08,162
‐ Must be a new Federation model.

198
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,440
‐ Banagher! Banagher Links,

199
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,060
that's you in there, isn't it?

200
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
‐ Audrey?

201
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,290
Audrey, is that you?

202
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,330
‐ You're all right, Banagher!

203
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,800
It's me, Mineva.

204
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,384
I mean Audrey Burne.

205
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:27,550
I'm so glad that you're safe.

206
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,850
‐ What are you doing here?

207
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,520
Are you piloting that suit?

208
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,390
‐ And I'd like to know what
you are doing in the Gundam.

209
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,360
What happened to the ECOAS team?

210
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,193
‐ Who are you?

211
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,230
Ensign Riddhe Marcenas, remember?

212
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,730
You caught my good‐luck charm.

213
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,498
‐ Oh, Ensign Riddhe?

214
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:48,415
‐ Banagher!

215
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,120
‐ I'm taking her to Earth.

216
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,280
We have to go.

217
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,050
‐ To Earth?

218
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,940
‐ I've given this a great deal of thought.

219
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,080
Ensign Riddhe's father, Ronan Marcenas,

220
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,740
is a member of the
Federation Central Assembly.

221
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,070
He's an influential figure
on Spacenoid policy.

222
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,540
I will meet with him and tell him

223
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,660
everything that has happened.

224
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
As the heir to the Zabi bloodline,

225
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,170
It's important that I resolve
this situation peacefully ‐‐

226
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,710
‐ Slow down there a second!

227
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,650
‐ I get that this is a
lot to take in so fast.

228
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,170
I understand your confusion,

229
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,880
but we're looking for the best solution.

230
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,940
‐ You have to return to the Nahel Argama.

231
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,560
The Federation will cease their attack

232
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,360
once they have you and the Unicorn.

233
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,490
‐ Mineva... I mean, Audrey will be fine.

234
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,940
I give you my word.

235
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,680
This Delta Plus is equipped
for atmospheric reentry.

236
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,130
We've got everything we need.

237
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,850
‐ Audrey, just answer one question.

238
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,730
Is this what you really want?

239
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,910
‐ Yes. I believe that it is.

240
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,890
‐ [Banagher] Alright then.

241
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,390
Ensign Riddhe, I'll take your word on it.

242
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,480
I expect you to take care of Audrey.

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
‐ He sure knows how to motivate someone.

244
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,350
We've burned up too much fuel already.

245
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,340
We have to use that mass driver.

246
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,860
‐ But Ensign, Banagher is going ‐‐

247
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,280
‐ I know that.

248
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
This is between me and Banagher now.

249
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,660
I'll ask you to stay out of it.

250
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,140
‐ Hey, did he give up already?

251
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,080
That damn quad‐wing!

252
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,643
What?

253
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:03,030
‐ Securing that mobile
suit has top priority,

254
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,030
even if all that remains is the cockpit.

255
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,120
No war is justified, is it?

256
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,405
‐ Ms. Marida, is that you?

257
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,205
‐ How did he ‐‐
‐ It's Banagher!

258
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:24,680
Banagher Links!

259
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,380
If that's you, you have to listen!

260
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,110
‐ Surrender immediately Banagher Links.

261
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,210
If you don't, I'll toast the cockpit.

262
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,640
‐ What are you doing in there?

263
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,270
‐ Who I am doesn't matter.

264
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,160
Right now, you and I are nothing more

265
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,370
than combat units called pilots.

266
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,710
Shut down your main generator right now ‐‐

267
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,543
‐ Combat units?

268
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,610
You're wrong, you're Ms. Marida!

269
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,450
That's how I knew it was you.

270
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,620
I could feel you.

271
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,190
Palau is your team's home, right?

272
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,240
If the Federation gets the
Unicorn back, they'll retreat.

273
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,680
‐ [Marida] That's the
rhetoric an enemy pilot.

274
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,080
‐ Audrey's here, too!

275
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,010
She came to stop all the fighting!

276
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,030
‐ [Marida] The Princess?

277
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,570
Tell me where she is.

278
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,280
‐ Please consider not
fighting, just for now.

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,160
Think of all the civilians at Palau.

280
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,010
Like Mr. Gilboa and his family,

281
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,630
they could die!

282
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,770
‐ If you surrender to me

283
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,810
and tell me where to find the Princess,

284
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,270
we'll withdraw our forces, too.

285
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,200
Look at you!

286
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,430
You talk about how you want
all the fighting to stop,

287
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,130
but you're perspective on it
is that of the Federation.

288
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,240
‐ I'm not! I'm not on their side.

289
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,960
You people are too single‐minded!

290
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,470
That's why Audrey doesn't
want you to have the Box!

291
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,470
‐ More rhetoric from the enemy!

292
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,630
‐ Damn you, you stubborn idiot!

293
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,523
‐ Gundam!

294
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,040
‐ NT‐D activation confirmed.

295
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,810
The enemy has engaged the Kshatriya.

296
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,770
‐ Poor psycho‐monitor reception might

297
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,180
force us to come out from behind Palau.

298
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,810
Keep a close eye out for
enemy ships, as well.

299
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,770
‐ A task fit for a cyber‐Newtype, then?

300
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,300
‐ Why are you leaving
Marida to fight alone?

301
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,990
‐ This is a job that only
the Lieutenant can perform.

302
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,990
The way to activate the NT‐D

303
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,280
is to get him to fight someone

304
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,000
who could be a Newtype.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,500
We've installed a psycho‐monitor
aboard the Unicorn.

306
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,170
We'll intercept any Box data

307
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,500
that gets revealed by the
activation of the NT‐D.

308
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,910
Since we cannot analyze
the La+ Program itself,

309
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,040
the best option is to
break the seals one by one.

310
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,100
To accomplish that,

311
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,680
we had to use the Federation's inside man

312
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,620
to bring Banagher back
to the Unicorn Gundam.

313
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,350
It is of course regrettable

314
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,010
that I had to leave you
in the dark, Captain.

315
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,110
‐ But Marida is a ‐‐

316
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,240
‐ Yes Captain, I know.

317
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,090
A cyber‐Newtype can't be said

318
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,180
to be a pure Newtype.

319
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,750
But then again, what
exactly is a "pure" Newtype?

320
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,980
No one has the answer to that.

321
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,560
What we need at this moment is a

322
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,520
catalyst that will trigger the NT‐D.

323
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,130
Until now we haven't seen what
this Gundam is capable of.

324
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,880
We're going to have Lt. Marida
draw out its true nature.

325
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,015
‐ Funnels!

326
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:36,055
Funnels!

327
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,481
Don't you recognize me?

328
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,170
Impossible, who are you?

329
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
‐ What's going on?

330
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,580
Is it the boy that's making that happen?

331
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,900
‐ [Char Clone] Not exactly.

332
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,630
At this point, the pilot is
just a processing mechanism

333
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,960
for converting received
psycho‐waves into hostility.

334
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,900
‐ Then what exactly is
piloting that Gundam?

335
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,060
‐ That would be the NT‐D.

336
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,520
It stands for Newtype Destroyer System.

337
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,710
If it identifies the enemy as a Newtype,

338
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,370
the suit's performance
limiters are disengaged.

339
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,860
It combines the paranormal
interface of the psycho‐frame

340
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,960
and the power to control an
enemy's psycommu weapons.

341
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,910
A Newtype hunting machine.

342
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,090
‐ But that's impossible.

343
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,690
No normal human could
handle something like that.

344
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,320
‐ Indeed they could not.

345
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,800
Which is precisely why
you need a cyber‐Newtype,

346
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,940
an enhanced human‐being.

347
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,120
Should a machine ever be
able to destroy a Newtype,

348
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,100
that is the day they will
all be consigned to history.

349
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,220
Universal Century is
approaching its hundredth year,

350
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,580
the UC Project was aptly named, indeed.

351
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,720
‐ Or more simply put,

352
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,830
you threw Marida out there to be bait ‐‐

353
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,300
‐ Ple Twelve.

354
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,670
That is her designation.

355
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,480
She is an artificial Newtype,

356
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,530
who has been engineered

357
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,080
through cloning and genetic modification.

358
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,560
The 12th in a series of prototypes.

359
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,260
‐ Master, you died?

360
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,093
Why?

361
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:07,164
What should I do, Master?

362
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:09,070
‐ [Female] What a foul little girl!

363
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,240
‐ [Male] What will you do
with a child like this?

364
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,390
‐ [Master] You'd be surprised
what some of my clients want.

365
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,930
Starting today, I'm your new Master.

366
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,040
‐ But she's so young!

367
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,190
‐ [Female] You've had that
dead weight removed, right?

368
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,170
Come on!

369
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,410
What army?

370
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,130
If you're some kind of Zeon fugitive,

371
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,670
I'm calling the police.

372
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,040
‐ That's enough.

373
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:40,285
[dramatic music]

375
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:48,660
‐ This is...

376
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,690
This is all too sad.

377
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,900
‐ Compassion alone can't save people.

378
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,870
It can't erase sin or
wash away our impurities.

379
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,930
‐ But in spite of it all...

380
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,700
‐ But in spite of it all...

381
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,690
‐ [Male] Roger that.

382
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,310
We'd like to observe the inspection

383
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,240
of the captured suit, over.

384
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,150
‐ Tactically it makes no sense.

385
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,610
It almost looked as if that quad‐wing

386
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,650
was intentionally sent
out there to fight alone.

387
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,990
This whole thing just doesn't feel right.

388
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,930
Can we be sure they
didn't rig it with a bomb?

389
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,700
‐ I seriously doubt they'd need to resort

390
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,010
to such tactics only to
take out the Nahel Argama.

391
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,380
That said, it's possible that
the boy was allowed to escape.

392
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,330
If this was for nothing,
I'll be very disappointed.

393
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,580
‐ You're not the only one.

394
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,070
[station chatter]

395
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:00,387
‐ Banagher...

396
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,820
‐ Looks like it's over.

397
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,960
And the Gundam has been taken
aboard the Nahel Argama.

398
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,440
Along with that quad‐wing.

399
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,780
They'll probably say I
was killed in action.

400
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,720
We have no choice but
to keep moving forward.

401
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,830
There's no going back, for either of us.

402
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,050
‐ The NZ‐666 Kshatriya.

403
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,170
Judging from the model number,

404
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,950
it's probably made by Neo Zeon.

405
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,760
There's a psycho‐frame
installed around the cockpit,

406
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,370
but it's an old one.

407
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,590
I bet they repurposed one of
the old Anaheim prototypes.

408
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,490
They could have had those left
over from Char's rebellion.

409
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,613
Captain Otto?

410
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,920
‐ You said that only Granada on the moon

411
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,610
has psycho‐frame manufacturing facilities?

412
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,590
‐ Yes, sir.

413
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,190
Since development of the technology

414
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,480
was officially halted,

415
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,040
they're completely responsible for it,

416
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,740
including maintaining its secrecy.

417
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,290
‐ And why was it halted?

418
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,200
‐ I heard it was because there
were just too many unknowns.

419
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,580
Even with the Unicorn,

420
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,890
you've noticed that
when the NT‐D is active,

421
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,210
you can see a glow from
the exposed psycho‐frame

422
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,700
between the armor.

423
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,490
Well we don't know why it does that,

424
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,370
and we're the ones who built it.

425
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,920
And sometimes that glow can be

426
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,130
converted into physical energy.

427
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:21,320
Um... I didn't see any
of the combat records,

428
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,370
but I bet it was a pretty
one‐sided fight, right Captain?

429
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,520
‐ Captain!

430
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,130
Message from sickbay.

431
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,970
The prisoner's vitals have stabilized.

432
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,620
In addition to her external injuries,

433
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,210
she seems to be in a weakened state,

434
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,340
so she won't stand an interrogation.

435
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,970
‐ About these scars from burns

436
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,640
and lacerations all over her body?

437
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,870
What caused those?

438
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,940
Dr. Hasan said that

439
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,460
her reproductive systems were also...

440
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,570
In the final days of
the First Neo Zeon War,

441
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,850
a Newtype Corps made up entirely of clones

442
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,390
was sent into battle,

443
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,060
but they were all supposed
to have been wiped out.

444
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,410
‐ It would seem one of them survived.

445
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,280
So this is what became of her?

446
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,490
We'll leave her interrogation to HQ.

447
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,323
‐ Understood, sir.

448
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:09,571
[grunting and wailing]

449
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,770
I sure hope this is the last ‐‐

450
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,210
‐ Detour we'll make?

451
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,480
I hope so, too.

452
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,400
‐ I don't think that will be necessary.

453
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,233
‐ Of course it is.

454
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:21,840
She's a cyber‐Newtype.

455
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,300
If she doesn't get her medication,

456
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,450
won't she go berserk?

457
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,070
She's the type that was genetically

458
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,480
designed from the ground up,

459
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,950
so there's no need to suppress

460
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,300
her immune response.

461
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,133
‐ But Doctor ‐‐

462
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,840
‐ Even her emotional state is stable,

463
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,200
and besides, her injuries are severe.

464
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,100
As a doctor, I can't allow my patient

465
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,840
to be put into a straitjacket.

466
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,770
‐ But she's a Neo Zeon, remember?

467
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,610
She might even try to hurt you!

468
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,793
‐ Ms. Marida would never do that!

469
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:46,626
‐ Banagher,

470
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,800
I didn't realize...

471
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,900
‐ How are you feeling?

472
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:53,070
‐ A straitjacket.

473
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,140
Are you serious?

474
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,570
‐ This is none of your concern, Banagher.

475
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,770
‐ She's hurt.

476
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,970
Plus Ms. Marida's an officer.

477
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,300
Don't you people have rules

478
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,960
for how to treat prisoners of war?

479
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,730
‐ The Sleeves are terrorists.

480
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,270
Even if she's an officer,

481
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,450
she's still a criminal.

482
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,660
‐ But she's, she's not.

483
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,020
‐ What happened to you at Palau?

484
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,650
Were you brainwashed?

485
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,140
She's the pilot of that quad‐wing!

486
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,710
She's the one responsible for all

487
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,060
the destruction at your own colony.

488
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,140
I can't begin to calculate

489
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,240
how many of our people she's killed.

490
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,180
‐ I know.

491
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,750
But if you can't see the enemy
for who they really are ‐‐

492
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,300
‐ We'll put her under guard.

493
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,880
Please notify us when
you intend to move her.

494
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,910
‐ Yes, ma'am.

495
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,830
Think about it.

496
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,040
Not even Ensign Riddhe came back, did he?

497
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,520
‐ What are cyber‐Newtypes, anyway?

498
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,770
‐ The result of a delusion.

499
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,920
That one might be able to
create Newtypes artificially.

500
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,140
To make a long story short,

501
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,620
that was the sophistry they used

502
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,850
to violate their ethics so they
could create human weapons.

503
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,960
You know the basic Newtype concept?

504
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,930
‐ Yeah, by living in space

505
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,300
we'll be able to understand each other

506
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,880
without misconceptions.

507
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,642
‐ That's right.

508
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,740
‐ But if we could be like that,

509
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,010
then there wouldn't be any
reason to go to war anymore,

510
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,843
would there?

511
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,810
‐ You know, somebody once said to me

512
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,030
that mankind was constantly at war

513
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,900
because we were stuck on the cusp

514
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,220
of a new stage of our evolution.

515
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,800
And that if there is any chance
for us to become Newtypes,

516
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,820
he said cyber‐Newtype
research should be allowed.

517
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,490
If we leave evolution to Mother Nature,

518
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,010
mankind will never make it.

519
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,090
We'll kill ourselves off

520
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,040
long before Mother Nature
has a chance to fix us.

521
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,620
‐ I think that's a pretty
sad way of looking at things.

522
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,570
‐ I agree.

523
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,710
That's why we have to work
on understanding each other

524
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,380
with whatever limited
abilities we have right now.

525
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,480
‐ It seems our roles have been reversed.

526
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,080
Don't stare at me like that.

527
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,930
‐ I'm still a bit fuzzy.

528
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,890
Can you tell me what happened back there?

529
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,520
‐ You must have been
swallowed up by the machine.

530
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,760
A psycommu backflow.

531
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,370
You think you're controlling it,

532
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,430
but then suddenly it's controlling you.

533
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,950
I sensed a powerful negative intent.

534
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,700
It was probably the instinct of that

535
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,830
system embedded in the Gundam.

536
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,950
To seek, hunt down, and destroy Newtypes.

537
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,640
Even artificial Newtypes.

538
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,390
A machine isn't capable of discerning

539
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,510
natural from artificial.

540
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,340
But people are another story.

541
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,520
They can feel the difference.

542
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,510
‐ But even you ‐‐

543
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,570
‐ I have a Master I must follow.

544
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,760
Even if I was created artificially,

545
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,790
my entire being is devoted
to serving him and his will.

546
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,390
My master's desires are my desires

547
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,240
and I oppose what my master opposes.

548
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,340
‐ But that's like a curse.

549
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,130
You're killing yourself little by little,

550
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,660
don't you see that?

551
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,090
‐ I saw inside you.

552
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,010
You and I might be two of a kind.

553
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,030
‐ What is that supposed to mean?

554
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,630
‐ If I don't see you as an equal,

555
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,540
then losing to you would
be too humiliating.

556
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,810
Still, the Gundam did stop.

557
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,810
Your will...

558
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,120
your foundation forced the
system into submission.

559
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,240
‐ My what?

560
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,960
‐ People like me don't have that.

561
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,020
That's why we can merge our
consciousness with machines.

562
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,853
‐ Ms. Marida ‐‐

563
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:26,686
‐ Never mind me.

564
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,763
From now on,

565
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:31,010
you're going to be forced to make

566
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,880
some much harder decisions.

567
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,470
Just remember, keep telling yourself

568
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,260
in spite of it all,
stay who you really are.

569
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,970
It's the foundation of
what makes you yourself.

570
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,290
The power that awakens that other system,

571
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,280
the one sleeping inside that Gundam.

572
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,390
The Box was

573
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,580
entrusted to it so it could...

574
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,265
‐ Ms. Marida!

575
00:29:57,265 --> 00:29:58,098
Ms. Marida!

576
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:58,931
‐ What's wrong?

577
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,345
[Marida screaming]

578
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,995
‐ Banagher look sad.

579
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:18,040
Banagher look sad.

580
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,330
‐ No one knows the princess is gone.

581
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,310
The Captain and the others

582
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,320
aren't about to let that one slip.

583
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,495
I just wish we could tell Ensign Mihiro

584
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,340
that Ensign Riddhe is alive.

585
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,850
She's all torn up.

586
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,655
‐ I didn't know they were an item.

587
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:37,250
‐ An item, an item!
‐ Don't quote me on that,

588
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,110
but still.

589
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,280
‐ I wonder if she made
it to Earth all right?

590
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,410
‐ He's protecting her,

591
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,560
so I'm sure she'll be fine.

592
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,650
You don't seem like yourself.

593
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,140
You were never this
composed about her before.

594
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,630
‐ [panting] Begging your pardon, sir!

595
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,920
Master, we've just received an urgent

596
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,120
communique from the military.

597
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,500
It's about Master Riddhe.

598
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,180
‐ [Male] Princess Mineva
has gone down to Earth?

599
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,830
‐ The intel comes from a sympathizer

600
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,600
inside the Federation Government.

601
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,920
He told us that a mobile
suit used Assembly privilege

602
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,600
to cross their defensive lines.

603
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,520
It seems likely ‐‐

604
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,060
‐ Could it not have been a diversion?

605
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,400
‐ Where's The Mock Trojan Horse?

606
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,910
‐ We're approaching
geosynchronous orbit now, sir.

607
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,610
‐ As expected.

608
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,860
They're headed for the
designated coordinates.

609
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,540
I believe this time we'll get something.

610
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,550
It's far too perfect a
place to break the La+ seal.

611
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,840
‐ The Klimt.

612
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,610
A shuttle used by the Vist Foundation

613
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,010
to transport works of art, eh?

614
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,070
‐ Looks like they're doing a little

615
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,140
orbital sightseeing above the equator.

616
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,380
They're not even accelerating.

617
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,950
‐ If we're assuming
that they came out here

618
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,660
to meet someone,

619
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,250
think it could be...

620
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,140
‐ Whatever their objective is,

621
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,400
if they really are planning
an orbital rendezvous,

622
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,010
that would leave them vulnerable.

623
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,510
‐ So do we attack, sir?

624
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,230
‐ We'll be scraping atmosphere.

625
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,200
Can we pull it off?

626
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,740
‐ We'll sure as hell give it a shot.

627
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,660
Laplace's Box notwithstanding,

628
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,540
we can't just leave Marida to stew aboard

629
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,110
their ship, can we Captain?

630
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,767
Flaste, the helm's yours!

631
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,620
‐ [Flaste] Um, wait a minute.

632
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,580
Captain, are you sure about this sir?

633
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,840
‐ I suppose.

634
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,400
‐ [Alberto] The Nahel
Argama will conduct an

635
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,670
inspection of the coordinate airspace.

636
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,500
Before the Unicorn is
shipped off to Luna II,

637
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,130
the information regarding the key

638
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,320
to Laplace's Box will be ‐‐

639
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,190
‐ Is there a problem, Alberto?

640
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,520
You aren't looking well.

641
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,020
‐ No no, not at all.

642
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,140
It's just that after all these battles,

643
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,360
the men are exhausted.

644
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,020
And well I

645
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,920
was just thinking

646
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,420
couldn't this matter have
been left to another unit?

647
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,210
‐ You wouldn't be getting
attached to them, would you?

648
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,540
Once you've landed on Earth,

649
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,350
you'll be able to relax.

650
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,440
‐ Landed on Earth?

651
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,810
‐ I've chartered a transport for you.

652
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,810
Use it to take the cyber‐Newtype

653
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,180
who's being held prisoner

654
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,669
to Augusta in North America.

655
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:30,750
‐ Augusta?

656
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,800
‐ Right.

657
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,350
The labs have been shut down,

658
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,850
but the facilities
needed for readjustments

659
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,400
are still operational.

660
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,830
‐ What exactly did you have in mind?

661
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,230
‐ You know, if Grandfather
had simply told me

662
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,030
the location of the Box,

663
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,110
I wouldn't have to resort to
such underhanded measures.

664
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,480
I don't know what Grandfather
and Cardeas' goal was,

665
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,380
but if the Box was lost,

666
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,640
then the Foundation's
fortunes will be lost with it.

667
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,000
Keep in mind,

668
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,010
there is activity within
the Federation Government

669
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,590
to try to gain the Box for itself.

670
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,550
Don't let petty sympathies
get the better of you.

671
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,270
Our very lives depend on Laplace's Box.

672
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,620
I'm counting on you, Alberto.

673
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,860
‐ [Banagher] I won't do it!

674
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,030
‐ That wasn't a request.

675
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,730
If the Unicorn is piloted through the

676
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,270
coordinates given by the La+ Program,

677
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,060
there's a high probability that another

678
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,610
seal on the program will be broken.

679
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,450
I'll ride along with you.

680
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,600
Here's the plan.

681
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,160
You will take the suit to
the appropriate coordinates.

682
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,720
And that's a direct order.

683
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,210
‐ You saw it, back at Palau.

684
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,570
The suit just...

685
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,260
Besides I'm not even a soldier,

686
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,540
I shouldn't have to take orders from you.

687
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,790
‐ You're not a soldier,

688
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,020
and you don't have to take orders,

689
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,010
but you do have to start

690
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,540
taking responsibility for your actions.

691
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,990
You've stepped onto the
battlefield three times now

692
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,910
in a powerful experimental weapon.

693
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,670
Some lives may have been saved,

694
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,590
but others were lost.

695
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,530
You've taken it upon yourself
to interfere in the destinies

696
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,860
of a lot of people, both
friend and foe alike.

697
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,570
And for that you have
to take responsibility.

698
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,840
‐ But how?

699
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,810
‐ By seeing it through to the end.

700
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,110
‐ You want me to keep
fighting until I die,

701
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,490
is that your plan?

702
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,570
Or am I supposed to help you
with your crazy treasure hunt?

703
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,340
‐ I'll leave you to think that about that.

704
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,400
You have to choose.

705
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,670
All you're doing now is running away

706
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,340
from the problems you've
made for yourself.

707
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,120
‐ Listen to me, people are going to die!

708
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,790
Are you telling me my "responsibility"

709
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,210
is to go kill people?

710
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,700
Tell me how am I supposed to choose

711
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,240
to do something like that?

712
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,320
‐ Don't be so hard on him.

713
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,790
He has to see things from that
perspective, it's his job.

714
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,580
‐ What is it, Commander?

715
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,450
Something wrong?

716
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,980
‐ No, something just occurred to me,

717
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,390
if I had a son of my own,

718
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,490
I would've gone through this a lot sooner.

719
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:16,090
‐ [Captain] I haven't been
this close to it since

720
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,300
my grade school came here on a field trip.

721
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,210
‐ [Female] Well obviously,
this is the first place

722
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,530
that comes to mind if you ask
anyone about "Laplace's Box."

723
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,560
‐ Latitude, zero.

724
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,740
Longitude, zero.

725
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,620
Altitude, 200 kilometers.

726
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,700
The wreckage of Laplace
has passed this point

727
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,660
every day for almost a hundred years.

728
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,130
Well, if nothing's been
discovered here by now

729
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,370
I doubt we'll turn up anything new ‐‐

730
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,450
‐ Back when I was a child,

731
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,340
this had already been removed
from the school tour list.

732
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,430
Captain, Commander,

733
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,840
I want to thank you for assisting us.

734
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,350
‐ Well don't expect me to say
the pleasure was all ours.

735
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,860
You caused me and my
crew a lot of trouble.

736
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,410
That's right, we won't
be forgetting your face.

737
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,440
‐ I regret I can't observe
the investigation personally.

738
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,060
May fortune continue to
smile on you in battle.

739
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,893
Good day.

740
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,690
‐ That's strange.

741
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,980
He's usually so obsessed with the Box.

742
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,840
‐ I guess in the end,
he's just an errand boy.

743
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,060
Anaheim will get the investigation
results via Staff HQ.

744
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,420
‐ Do you suppose that's
all there is to it?

745
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,260
Transporting a prisoner
on a civilian vessel.

746
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,050
It's against procedure.

747
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,210
Why would Headquarters allow that?

748
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,750
What do you think they
ultimately have in mind for her?

749
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,820
‐ The cover story, such that it is,

750
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,810
is that Luna II doesn't
have the facilities

751
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,540
to care for a cyber‐Newtype.

752
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,760
‐ RX‐0, launch.

753
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,610
‐ He feels like piloting it now, does he?

754
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,440
‐ [Female] The Nahel Argama is currently

755
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
in a low orbit over the Earth.

756
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,350
In principle, it's no different
from operating in space,

757
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,020
but if you don't constantly maintain

758
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,200
the prescribed speed,

759
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,370
the Earth's gravity could
pull you in so be careful.

760
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,203
‐ Got it.

761
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,730
‐ [Captain] When we were told
to attack Palau on our own,

762
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,110
I'll be honest with you,

763
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,610
we were already pretty ragged.

764
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,810
Then Commander Daguza came to me.

765
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,180
He called it a hostage rescue operation.

766
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,470
He said we owed it to you
to get you out of there.

767
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,650
Commander Daguza is acting
with the kind of responsibility

768
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,800
we should all have for one another.

769
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,800
‐ What is it?

770
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,633
‐ Nothing.

771
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:32,270
Mr. Daguza, do you ever question
what it is you're doing?

772
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,350
‐ I'm just a cog in a machine
known as the Federation.

773
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,660
I simply follow orders,

774
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,410
there's nothing for me to question.

775
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,110
‐ I'm not certain of anything,

776
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,690
not even who my friends and enemies are.

777
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,320
Someone like that isn't qualified

778
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
to pick up a weapon, is he?

779
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,320
I didn't want to set foot
in this thing ever again.

780
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,820
Even if it meant that I
would be letting Him down.

781
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,350
‐ Here's another perspective,

782
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,070
there are people you have
to take responsibility for.

783
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,520
People close to you.

784
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,320
‐ Are you talking about Takuya and Micott?

785
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,260
‐ Once we get back to Luna II,

786
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,610
what happens to your friends
will depend on what we report.

787
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,120
And the contents of that report

788
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,500
will depend on your actions now.

789
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,990
‐ Still taking hostages?

790
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,950
‐ See it however you choose,

791
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,690
but right now their fate is in your hands.

792
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,460
At least for now it
looks like you're making

793
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,760
the right choice.

794
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,400
‐ Another launch confirmed.

795
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,370
It appears to be on a
rendezvous trajectory

796
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,660
with the suits that launched before it.

797
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,840
‐ Is it the Gundam?

798
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,040
‐ Unable to confirm.

799
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,730
No response on psycho‐monitor.

800
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,490
‐ So we can't track it in its

801
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,400
single‐horn configuration.

802
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,570
What's the status of the Foundation ship?

803
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,630
‐ They're moving to rendezvous now.

804
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,480
That is assuming the Mock Trojan Horse

805
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,490
decelerates to orbital velocity.

806
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,290
Estimated time to contact
approximately ten minutes.

807
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,360
360 km above the equator.

808
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,410
East longitude 15 degrees, 28 minutes.

809
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,030
‐ [Male] Just as we were told.

810
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,820
It looks like their plan is to rendezvous

811
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,670
and then inspect these coordinates.

812
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,470
We'll take our shot when all their suits

813
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,720
are away at the Laplace wreckage.

814
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,020
‐ Roger that, sir.

815
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,280
The Garencieres has finally

816
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,410
gotten a job that's right up its alley.

817
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,770
‐ [Male] Alright Hotshot.

818
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,440
Don't forget about your family
waiting for you back at home.

819
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,710
‐ Of course I won't.

820
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,790
You can count on me to
bring Marida back, sir.

821
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,623
‐ I will.

822
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,200
‐ [Daguza] It's possible that
the La+ Program displays data

823
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,620
when it recognizes the suit's coordinates.

824
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,850
The last time the NT‐D activated,

825
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,350
it didn't display any new information.

826
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,210
The station wreckage passes through these

827
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,310
coordinates every day
at exactly 0000 hours.

828
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,730
‐ The prime minister's residence that was

829
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,010
destroyed by a terrorist attack.

830
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,490
If the Box was hidden in
such an obvious location,

831
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,090
don't you think that someone

832
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,650
would have discovered it by now?

833
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,310
‐ We have absolutely no idea,

834
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,320
which is why we're checking it out.

835
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,490
We'll have only one
chance to make contact.

836
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,590
Stay focused.

837
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,541
[quiet suspenseful music]

838
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,740
‐ Conroy, I want you to report
if you notice any change,

839
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,910
no matter how minor.

840
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,743
‐ [Conroy] Roger that.

841
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:26,350
‐ T‐minus two minutes to destination

842
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,500
‐ To save this world from overpopulation,

843
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,660
a massive space settlement
plan was necessary.

844
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,100
And to carry it out, we needed
to create an organization

845
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,710
with absolute authority.

846
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,110
An organization to act as God.

847
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,520
‐ The Federation Government?

848
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,860
‐ [Daguza] A vengeful God
that would crush without mercy

849
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,490
anyone who would dare oppose it.

850
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,630
The sabotage of the Prime
Minister's residence

851
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,170
was the best thing that
could have happened for

852
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,800
the Federation Government.

853
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,750
The Federation retained
all of its authority

854
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,620
under the pretense of preventing terror.

855
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,410
‐ You make it sound like the Federation

856
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,490
may have staged the attack itself.

857
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,530
‐ In the real world,

858
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,440
things like that sometimes happen.

859
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,640
Thing is, no one involved
back then is alive today.

860
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,420
All that endures is the tradition

861
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,770
of living in fear of the Box,

862
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,560
and the symbiotic relationship

863
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,670
with the Vist Foundation.

864
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,920
‐ Tradition?

865
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,440
‐ It's just the way things are.

866
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,740
No one person's going to change that.

867
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,460
Nobody even feels the slightest bit of

868
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,180
aspiration to change it.

869
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,170
It could happen to any organization.

870
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,020
You can't blame the cogs in the machine

871
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,160
trying to maintain the status quo.

872
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,040
And to maintain the balance in the system,

873
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,480
all the Box had to do was to
stay put for a hundred years.

874
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,740
‐ T‐minus 15 seconds to destination.

875
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,710
12...

876
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,620

2...

886
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,440
1!

887
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,500
We've arrived, sir.

888
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,340
Passing through designated coordinates.

889
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,730
‐ The suit systems are nominal.

890
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,870
How's it look?

891
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,460
‐ No change.

892
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,690
‐ How does it look out there?

893
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,080
‐ [Conroy] There's no change, sir.

894
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,720
Either to the Unicorn or
Laplace Station wreckage.

895
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:13,566
‐ [Prime Minister Recording] Greetings,

896
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:15,150
citizens of Earth and space.

897
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,923
It is with great pride
that I swear to you ‐‐

898
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:18,120
‐ Where's that coming from?

899
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,241
‐ [Conroy] What is it?

900
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:20,240
‐ Unknown!

901
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,940
Can you trace the
transmission from your end?

902
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,870
‐ [Female] We are detecting
radio waves emanating

903
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,120
from the RX‐0.

904
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,680
Please advise.

905
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,980
‐ It's coming from here?!

906
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,180
‐ [Conroy] I'm reading the same.

907
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,208
‐ [Prime Minister Recording]
Welcome to an unknown world,

908
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,790
the Universal Century.

909
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,490
As Prime Minister of the Earth Federation,

910
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,650
I'd like to [high pitch whoosh]

911
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,650
‐ The signal's coming from the Unicorn?!

912
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,060
Was the seal broken when it came

913
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,370
into contact with the
La+ Station wreckage?

914
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,350
What's the status of the NT‐D?

915
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,020
‐ So far activation
has not been confirmed.

916
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,280
Shall I delay our departure
so that you may observe, sir?

917
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,170
‐ Inform the Klimt that our departure time

918
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,030
may have to be delayed due
to extenuating circumstances.

919
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:03,124
‐ Mas...ter...

920
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,330
‐ Minovsky particles?!

921
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,210
The density is rapidly increasing.

922
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,730
But I'm unable to pinpoint the direction

923
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,890
of the dispersal source.

924
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,930
The pattern is not normalizing!

925
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,430
‐ Prepare for anti‐air combat!

926
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,320
All hands, put on normal suits!

927
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,640
We may have an enemy ship

928
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,240
mixed in with those
civilian vessels out there!

929
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,270
Anti‐air defenses keep your eyes peeled!

930
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,880
‐ Sir, we're inside Earth's
Absolute Defense Zone.

931
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,430
Camouflaged or not,

932
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,040
they couldn't have snuck a
fleet‐scaled force out there.

933
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,850
‐ That's exactly the problem!

934
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,330
If they're planning on attacking us

935
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,470
using a small force,

936
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,024
it means they have a plan
to do it effectively!

937
00:44:36,024 --> 00:44:37,090
‐ [Prime Minister Recording]
population growth,

938
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,040
dwindling natural resources,

939
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,111
we must come up with
solutions for these problems.

940
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,650
And each and every one
of us must be willing

941
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,250
to change our thinking,

942
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,250
to see ourselves [high pitch whoosh]

943
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:00,350
‐ Commander!

944
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,650
‐ Banagher!

945
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,650
‐ Something's coming.

946
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,500
The Nahel Argama is being targeted.

947
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,260
‐ Recall the investigation team now!

948
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,060
We'll use the ECOAS Lotos
as makeshift gun turrets.

949
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,893
‐ Roger.

950
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:10,990
What about the Unicorn?

951
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,840
‐ It's piping out some crazy speech.

952
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,440
Have them evacuate the area

953
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,980
before it becomes a target!

954
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,880
‐ Yes, sir.

955
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,050
Attention all mobile suits,

956
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,570
this is the bridge.

957
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:22,120
Abandon the mission and
return to ship immediately!

958
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:24,943
‐ What is it?

959
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,523
‐ There!

960
00:45:27,523 --> 00:45:28,860
‐ Can you tell how many?

961
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,080
‐ There's one.

962
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,800
No, there's another
formation following it.

963
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,300
‐ The enemy squadron is pinned down

964
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,120
near the wreckage of La+ Station.

965
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,953
‐ Good.

966
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:48,830
Gilboa, don't stay any
longer than you have to.

967
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,830
‐ [Gilboa] Roger that.

968
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,663
‐ Be careful.

969
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:52,990
That Gundam is moving
faster than we thought.

970
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,290
It looks like it's the only suit

971
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,960
to have left the La+ wreckage.

972
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,500
‐ The kid did seem to have good intuition.

973
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,490
‐ There's one thing that's bothering me,

974
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,790
you don't think that this speech

975
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,440
playing is all that's
going to happen, do you?

976
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,520
‐ Who knows?

977
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,820
The NT‐D isn't active yet.

978
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,630
There has to be something still hidden.

979
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,110
‐ Laser signal received!

980
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,130
‐ From the Rewloola?

981
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,540
‐ No, not from them.

982
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,408
It's from ‐‐

983
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:15,300
‐ Full Frontal,

984
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,210
here so soon?

985
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,990
‐ Use your beam magnum!

986
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,320
You can hit him at this range.

987
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,153
‐ No way.

988
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,170
It's too powerful.

989
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,000
‐ Now is not the time to hold back!

990
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,260
‐ I have to get closer!

991
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,370
‐ Do you think this is a game, boy?!

992
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,460
You take out the enemy as soon as you can.

993
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,570
If you let them go now,

994
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,070
they will come back later
and kill your people

995
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,660
or even you!

996
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,400
‐ Of course it's not a game!

997
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,030
I take it seriously when my life

998
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,370
or anyone's is on the line,

999
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,850
I'm doing everything I can,

1000
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,680
all right?!

1001
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,090
‐ Stay back, Banagher!

1002
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,150
‐ Mr. Gilboa!

1003
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,760
‐ We won't destroy the ship.

1004
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,510
Our mission objective is just
to get Marida back, alright?

1005
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,520
‐ You're kidding.

1006
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,353
But how?

1007
00:47:09,353 --> 00:47:10,280
‐ Don't worry about it,

1008
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,320
just stay back.

1009
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,130
There's no reason for you to die here.

1010
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,080
‐ Mr. Gilboa, wait!

1011
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,130
‐ Take back the prisoner?

1012
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,070
RX‐0 to Romeo 010, request relay.

1013
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,380
The enemy's objective appears

1014
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,030
to be retrieving our prisoner.

1015
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,600
‐ Enemy reinforcements?

1016
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,650
‐ The Red Comet.

1017
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,420
‐ We will leave the Mock Trojan Horse

1018
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,170
to the Garencieres Team.

1019
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,430
As for us, we will attack the Unicorn

1020
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,570
and force the NT‐D to activate.

1021
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,403
‐ Yes, sir!

1022
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:41,380
‐ [Char Clone] And don't hold back.

1023
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,820
Fight like you mean to take
it down or it won't activate.

1024
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,830
‐ Without question.

1025
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,960
Now allow us to clear a path for you, sir!

1026
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,630
He's toying with us!

1027
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,370
I will not allow you to go easy on me.

1028
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,720
Now stop playing around
and turn into a Gundam!

1029
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,140
‐ You're not aiming properly!

1030
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,145
Return fire!

1031
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:14,145
‐ I am!

1032
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,680
‐ Where's the investigation team?!

1033
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,610
‐ There was a delay in
reeling in the Lotos.

1034
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,810
They won't be back for
another five minutes.

1035
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,970
‐ It's too late, postpone
the shuttle departure!

1036
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,800
We have to get somewhere safe now!

1037
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,040
‐ The battle's already begun!

1038
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,780
We have to get off this ship!

1039
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,370
‐ The prisoner's awake!

1040
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,879
[screaming]

1041
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,880
‐ Fight like you mean it, Banagher!

1042
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,180
Once you face off against him,

1043
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,890
the NT‐D should activate.

1044
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,010
If you keep this up,

1045
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,230
we'll be pummeled to death.

1046
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,030
‐ B‐But if I go all‐out,

1047
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,360
what will happen to you?

1048
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,630
‐ This jump seat isn't much,

1049
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,790
but I'm pretty tough.

1050
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,800
‐ Maybe I should just hand
this thing over to them.

1051
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,640
‐ And what would happen

1052
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,630
to the Nahel Argama without the Unicorn?

1053
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,540
Those people are professionals.

1054
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,850
If they retrieve the prisoner,

1055
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,370
they won't pass up a chance
to take out an enemy.

1056
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,910
Your friends are on board that ship.

1057
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:29,780
Think of them.

1058
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,950
‐ I know that!

1059
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,690
Believe me, I know!

1060
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,070
How could I forget,

1061
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,960
but still!

1062
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,290
‐ Open the hatch.

1063
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,383
Hurry!

1064
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:51,870
‐ What are you gonna do?

1065
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,860
‐ This will help you fight, won't it?

1066
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,980
‐ No, no!

1067
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,830
You've got it all wrong.

1068
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,120
That's not what the problem is!

1069
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,230
‐ Banagher, a little while ago

1070
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,950
I saw the NT‐D start to engage.

1071
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,500
It looked as though it was reacting

1072
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,880
to you personally.

1073
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,900
To your heart, which felt something

1074
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,260
as you were listening to the voice

1075
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,230
of this ghost of Laplace.

1076
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,560
‐ Reacting?

1077
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,393
My heart?

1078
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:14,020
‐ This is not a killing machine that was

1079
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,240
designed to eradicate Zeon.

1080
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,610
There's something else.

1081
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,930
Something special about the Unicorn.

1082
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,660
And whatever that thing is,

1083
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,490
it responds to your heart.

1084
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,270
Maybe that's what the
La+ Program really is.

1085
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,770
A guidepost that tests your

1086
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,580
heart as it leads you to the Box.

1087
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,440
Whoever designed this was
one crafty son of a bitch.

1088
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,273
‐ I'm sure that ‐‐

1089
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:39,200
‐ There's no time for that now.

1090
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,910
Once I go outside, you move
in and wait for my signal.

1091
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,500
‐ What are you planning to do?

1092
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,000
‐ Even a cog in the machine has its pride.

1093
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,532
Now you go and play your own part.

1094
00:50:49,532 --> 00:50:50,532
‐ My part...

1095
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,360
‐ You know it in here.

1096
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,670
It's the one place where you can

1097
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,540
decide for yourself who you are.

1098
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,570
Don't ever lose it.

1099
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:04,540
‐ [Prime Minister Recording]
It won't be long now.

1100
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,780
‐ Who I am,

1101
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,260
it's my

1102
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,420
responsibility.

1103
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,641
‐ [Prime Minister Recording]
Add to the human history

1104
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,959
we're all a part of

1105
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,480
and offer up a prayer.

1106
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,470
‐ All that's left now is the Unicorn.

1107
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,710
‐ This isn't about pride,

1108
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,470
and I'm not trying to redeem myself,

1109
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,120
I just listened to my heart.

1110
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,350
It's nice to know that
even cogs have them.

1111
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,002
It feels good to have hope.

1112
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:46,835
‐ [Prime Minister Recording]

1113
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:48,220
with faith in the god called Possibility.

1114
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,083
‐ It's him!

1115
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:57,916
‐ [Daguza] Use your Vulcans!

1116
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,310
Potshots, anything, just fire!

1117
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:16,281
Now!

1118
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:21,572
Banagher!

1119
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,230
You're my hope.

1120
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,650
It's all up to you now, Banagher.

1121
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,700
‐ You killed him!

1122
00:52:56,754 --> 00:52:57,587
‐ Captain!

1123
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:02,430
It turned into a Gundam!

1124
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:05,280
Cuaron, you have your orders!

1125
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,680
What an amateur.

1126
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,040
He's behaving exactly like

1127
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,770
the simulations predicted.

1128
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,350
We'll move in and flank him!

1129
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,360
The only thing we need is the cockpit!

1130
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,490
Destroy the rest!

1131
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,490
‐ [Male] Angelo, retreat!

1132
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,080
This is no ordinary opponent.

1133
00:53:44,392 --> 00:53:45,559
‐ You monster!

1134
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:03,040
Captain! Please withdraw!

1135
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,410
This isn't worth your life!

1136
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,630
‐ Laser contact with the
Sinanju has been lost!

1137
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,430
We can't pick it out from
the rest of the debris!

1138
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:12,400
‐ And the Gundam?

1139
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,990
‐ The Psycho‐monitor is still online.

1140
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,480
‐ If we track that, we
can get a lock on him.

1141
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,440
Alter heading and trajectory at once.

1142
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,870
We have to retrieve both suits

1143
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,700
before they get pulled
in by the gravity well.

1144
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,180
‐ With me at the helm, sir?

1145
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,250
‐ [Gilboa] It's an
atmospheric assist maneuver!

1146
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,840
I know you can manage it, Flaste!

1147
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,610
‐ Gilboa, your time's up.

1148
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,670
Come on back.

1149
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,940
You'll never be able to infiltrate the

1150
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,540
Mock Trojan Horse like this.

1151
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,373
‐ [Gilboa] But, sir!

1152
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:34,740
If we don't act now ‐‐

1153
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,860
‐ Abort the operation.

1154
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,360
That's an order!

1155
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,860
Gilboa Team, redeploy and
rescue the Frontal Team.

1156
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,310
‐ I'm gonna take you down or else!

1157
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,810
‐ Banagher, if you can hear me, stop this!

1158
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,780
If we keep this up, we'll
both burn in the atmosphere!

1159
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,910
‐ This time, I won't miss!

1160
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:22,692
‐ Banagher!

1161
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,390
‐ [Gilboa] Tikva,

1162
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,410
just look after the family for me.

1163
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,640
‐ Mr. Gilboa, no.
