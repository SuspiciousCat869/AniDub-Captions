00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:45,810
‐ That thing is built with psycho‐frame

8
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,110
throughout the whole body?

9
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,910
‐ [Man] We have confirmation.

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,820
The unidentified single horn shoot

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,100
transformed or morphed.

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,410
It's a Gundam!

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,243
‐ Gundam?

14
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,750
‐ Micott, look at that,
it's really a Gundam.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,820
‐ What's Gundam?

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,440
‐ It's the name of the first mobile suit

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,110
developed by the Federation.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,550
Zeon even used to call it the White Devil.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,910
‐ [Man] Attention bridge, the
machine currently engaging

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,553
the Sleeve's quad wing
appears to be a Gundam type!

21
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:14,877
‐ A Gundam, no way!

22
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:17,560
[whirring]

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,849
‐ Gundam.

24
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,237
Gundam.

25
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:21,904
Gundam is the enemy!

00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,416

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,010
‐ [Man] Attention, unidentified machine.

31
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,870
If you can hear this
message, identify yourself,

32
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,700
your affiliation, and
your combat objective.

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,920
I repeat, unidentified machine‐‐

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,250
‐ Your performance is a
disgrace, Suberoa Zinnerman.

35
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,470
You failed to retrieve Laplace's Box

36
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,080
and weren't even able
to rescue the princess.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,430
‐ None of these developments
could have been predicted.

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,460
For the time being, we have no choice

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,040
but to be patient and wait
to hear from the princess.

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,140
‐ Are you suggesting that we do nothing?

41
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,640
‐ Lieutenant Angelo.

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,340
I hear the enemy that Marida
was bested by in battle

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,910
was a Gundam, no less.

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,990
Intriguing.

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,880
I might need to come out there myself.

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,976
Have the Garencieres find out
the Federation's next move.

47
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:52,830
‐ Sir.

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,920
I will rectify this disgrace,
even if it costs me my life.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,430
‐ You mustn't let mistakes weigh you down.

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,300
Acknowledge them and take what
you've learned to move on.

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,790
That is the privilege of being a man.

52
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,236
[dramatic piano music]

[whizzing]
[groaning]

00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:35,479
‐ Mom?

55
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,490
‐ [Daguza] Riddhe.

56
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,450
You got lucky.

57
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,450
Don't overthink it.

58
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,080
Surviving doesn't mean you're a coward

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,640
any more than dying means you're brave.

60
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,460
The only thing that separates
life from death is luck.

61
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,550
‐ Sir.

62
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,510
I understand.

63
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,140
‐ [Norm] Attention, approaching vessel,

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,320
you are hereby ordered
to halt immediately.

65
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,440
This is the Nahel Argama of
the Federation Space Forces,

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,570
Londo Bell.

67
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,730
Your vessel has crossed our
ships' defensive perimeter.

68
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,220
‐ Those damned terrorists!

69
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,053
‐ [Man] Wait.

70
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,420
‐ [Norm] It's debris?

71
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,720
‐ It appears to be a derelict
vessel, Salamis class.

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,170
Our thermal sensors misidentified
its backup power supply.

73
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,660
‐ Stand down the alert,
return to your stations

74
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,820
and recall the mobile suits immediately.

75
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,840
‐ Are you sure?

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,879
‐ Is there a problem with that?

77
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,110
‐ [Daguza] It was misidentified debris?

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,010
‐ [Norm] That's right.

79
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,030
We're lucky it wasn't an enemy out there.

80
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,890
‐ But the enemy is always out there.

81
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,310
They must assume by now that
we've recovered Laplace's Box

82
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,650
and as long as that quad‐wing
mobile suit is operational,

83
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,390
I wouldn't expect them
to give up any time soon.

84
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,150
‐ So, now is not the time to sit back

85
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,610
and wait for reinforcements.

86
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,080
‐ Precisely.

87
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,220
Have you unlocked it yet?

88
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,370
‐ No, sir.

89
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,060
Frankly, I didn't expect the system

90
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,820
to be quite this resistant.

91
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,280
‐ So you had no knowledge
of what was going on

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,090
outside your own department?

93
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,310
‐ Correct.

94
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,150
And once development of the UC Project

95
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,840
was placed under the jurisdiction
of the Vist Foundation,

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,340
we were kept even more in
the dark about things‐‐

97
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,940
‐ Hey, what does that have to do

98
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,680
with the situation at hand?

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,503
‐ [Man] The com is closed.

100
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:28,270
[grumbling]

101
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,460
‐ What is the UC Project?

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,450
Look, ECOAS isn't officially
investigating this.

103
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,560
If we were, our guests from Anaheim

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,910
would keep us from getting
to the truth anyway.

105
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,660
‐ The UC Project.

106
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,990
It's a top secret program
conducted as part of the

107
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,130
EFSF Reorganization Plan.

108
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,570
This Unicorn is the flagship.

109
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,340
The entire body incorporates
psycho‐frame technology

110
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,070
which supplements the psycommu,

111
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,950
transmitting the pilot's psycho‐waves

112
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,720
directly to the drive system.

113
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,180
‐ Meaning the pilot can control
this entirely by thought?

114
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,772
But it's too much strain on
the pilot's body, am I right?

115
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,350
‐ Uh, right.

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,020
But, supposedly, the NT‐D has a time limit

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,200
of only five minutes once activated.

118
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,804
‐ This NT‐D you mentioned‐‐

119
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:17,387
‐ Commander Daguza!

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,390
I was very clear that I must be present

121
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,370
should you decide to interrogate my staff!

122
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,740
‐ Daguza to bridge.

123
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,430
Rather than wait for reinforcements,

124
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,190
I suggest we leave the sector immediately.

125
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,610
I have new information
suggesting that the recovered

126
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,550
Gundam is connected in
some way to Laplace's Box.

127
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,910
I recommend you set a course

128
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,830
for Luna II as soon as you're able.

129
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,440
‐ That may be, but‐‐
‐ I agree, Captain Otto!

130
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,280
However, why would we go to Luna II?

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,500
We should go to our Anaheim
Electronics headquarters,

132
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,780
at Von Braun on the moon.

133
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,800
‐ [Man] Attention, the ship
is entering second deployment.

134
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
‐ Please, wait here for now.

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,430
Let me know if you need anything.

136
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,790
‐ [Audrey] Have you
received any word about

137
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,470
who was piloting that Gundam?

138
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,230
‐ No, from what I've been told,

139
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,823
the hatch hasn't even been opened yet.

140
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,260
‐ Hey there!

141
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,460
Are you doing all right?

142
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,950
Oh, I'm the ReZEL pilot
that pulled you guys out.

143
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,750
My name's Riddhe Marcenas.

144
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,340
‐ And my name is Audrey Burne.

145
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,360
‐ You want to go take a look?

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,340
At the Gundam?

147
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,090
You are curious, aren't you?

148
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,980
‐ Ensign Riddhe‐‐

149
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,110
‐ It'll be fine, Ensign Mihiro.

150
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,480
I know a secret spot
where we can steal a peak.

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,900
‐ That's not what I meant!

152
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,440
‐ I wanna go!

153
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,380
This Nahel Argama was the mothership

154
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,580
of the Gundam team in
the first Neo Zeon War

155
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,630
and now it's carrying this new Gundam!

156
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,950
It's just too cool.

157
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,080
It's like destiny or something.

158
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,500
‐ Uh, yeah.

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,010
‐ Hey, you coming Micott?

160
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,780
‐ [Micott] Whatever.

161
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,630
‐ And I'm coming, too.

162
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,900
If that Gundam hadn't
shown up when it did,

163
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,090
you and I wouldn't be
having this discussion now.

164
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,150
I, for one, want to meet the
pilot who saved our lives.

165
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,830
‐ [Alberto] Unlike Luna II,

166
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,810
which is on the far side of the Earth,

167
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,643
the moon is

168
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,900
right next to it‐‐
‐ That's exactly why our enemy

169
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,800
will expect us to head there.

170
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
I think a detour course for
Luna II is a wiser choice.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,480
‐ [Alberto] If you're worried
about our limited resources,

172
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,780
I'm sure we can make it to the moon.

173
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,690
Clearly, commander, you've
just become anxious.

174
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,400
‐ [Daguza] Send us out into
the open with no reinforcements

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,320
and I'll become even more anxious.

176
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,430
We're here now because
of corporate interference

177
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,240
with a military command structure.

178
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,040
‐ [Alberto] The duty of
a soldier, commander,

179
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,947
is to carry out orders!
‐ I've heard enough of this.

180
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,110
‐ Don't blame me for your‐‐
‐ Turn it off!

181
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,040
I know that ECOAS can do as
they please during an operation,

182
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,520
but I wish they'd get off our backs

183
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,530
while we're giving them a free ride.

184
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,180
To say nothing of that
primadonna from Anaheim!

185
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,980
‐ Complaining to us about it
won't affect the situation.

186
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,150
[beeping]

187
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,760
‐ The derelict ship we
encountered has decelerated.

188
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,570
Now traveling at relative speed zero.

189
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,780
‐ Haunted by ghosts of the One Year War?

190
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,720
Have the mobile suits eliminated.

191
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
They can move something
that size, no problem.

192
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,350
‐ But they've already returned.

193
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,310
‐ They what?

194
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,380
‐ Well, those were your orders, Captain.

195
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,540
Would you like to give the
order to send them back out?

196
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,160
‐ Just blast them with the main guns!

197
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,000
[whirring]

198
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,140
‐ Bingo, that's them.

199
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,130
We've confirmed the enemy's position.

200
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,940
‐ Transmit the coordinates
to the Rewloola.

201
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,630
Then we'll see what they can do.

202
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,730
‐ [Man] Attention all hands!

203
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,070
The ship is‐‐
‐ So that's Gundam?

204
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,120
‐ That's what they're saying.

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,310
It looks so different.

206
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,220
‐ I feel like I've seen
you somewhere before.

207
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,410
Hey.

208
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,300
You look like Natsume Swanson,
you know, the famous actress!

209
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,580
‐ I don't know much about
the entertainment industry.

210
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,130
‐ Oh, right.

211
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,453
‐ Ensign!

212
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,536
[muffled chattering]

213
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,200
‐ The hatch is opening!

214
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,181
[gasping]

215
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,390
‐ [Boy] Banagher?

216
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,440
Why is he‐‐
‐ How could he be the pilot?

217
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,706
[beeping]

218
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,518
‐ [Computer] Banagher.

219
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:38,351
Banagher.

220
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,603
‐ Doctor!

221
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:44,070
‐ Banagher.

222
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,680
‐ Hey, are you okay?

223
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,099
‐ Audrey.

224
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:54,440
‐ Banagher, can you hear me?

225
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,380
If you can hear me, squeeze my hand.

226
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,020
‐ Mihiro to the bridge.

227
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,080
The boy is just regaining consciousness.

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,350
Commander Daguza?

229
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,970
‐ I'd like to talk to the boy.

230
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,560
The rest of you can leave.

231
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,660
‐ Of course, sir, but‐‐

232
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,560
‐ Can you at least wait
until I've examined the boy?

233
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,100
He's just regained consciousness

234
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,560
and doesn't even know where he is.

235
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,900
‐ You understand that
he's hurt, don't you?

236
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,910
‐ I understand this minor is a civilian

237
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,010
who hijacked a military mobile suit,

238
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,250
then interfered in a combat situation,

239
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,950
a violation of the law severe enough

240
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,817
to warrant capital punishment.

241
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:26,650
[gasping]

242
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,560
‐ Are you serious?

243
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,580
‐ But, sir, he saved all of our lives,

244
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,090
doesn't that count for something?

245
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,270
‐ Not in a stolen combat machine.

246
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,430
‐ We're all set to launch, Captain.

247
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,870
All you need do is sit back and observe.

248
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,610
Leave the rest to us.

249
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,390
‐ All of this has to be
related to Laplace's Box,

250
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,860
am I right, Lieutenant?

251
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,660
A secret important enough to warrant

252
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,200
the deployment of ECOAS to retrieve it.

253
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,900
‐ There's a limit to
how much the Federation

254
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,700
can mobilize in secrecy.

255
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,090
Even as we speak, I'm sure
they're in discussions

256
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,860
about how to handle the situation.

257
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,310
All those responsible parties

258
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,430
trying to avoid responsibility.

259
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,310
‐ I hope you're right.

260
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,060
‐ They're here without
backup, aren't they?

261
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,050
I'm positive.

262
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,550
The captain will be going out today.

263
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,400
There won't be anything for us to do.

264
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,760
‐ And you stand by this story?

265
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,990
You expect us to believe that Cardeas Vist

266
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,700
just gave it to a boy?

267
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,570
So, did he say anything
when he gave you this gift?

268
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,770
‐ Like I said, he told me
to take the mobile suit

269
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,980
and use it to protect everyone.

270
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,010
That's all he said.

271
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,610
Would it be easier to
believe if he were my father?

272
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,263
‐ Huh?

273
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:48,513
[rumbling]

00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,300

275
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,930
Turn about, full speed!

276
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,960
‐ Damage report and scan the area!

277
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,230
‐ There's no one out there.

278
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,433
‐ Look harder.

279
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,683
[whirring]

280
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,430
‐ We've fallen into a trap.

281
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,640
‐ [Alberto] This is your fault, Captain,

282
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160
you and your indecision!

283
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,340
If we had‐‐

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,310
I count four total.

287
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,190
They're approaching
from directly above us.

288
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,023
‐ Are they missiles?

289
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:26,830
‐ No, sir, not judging
by their flight paths.

290
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,520
I'd say they were mobile suits.

291
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,510
But the way they're
navigating the debris field,

292
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,176
it's impossible.

293

[dramatic music]

294
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,840
The lead machine is approaching it,

295
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
three times the speed of the others.

296
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,010
‐ This should be interesting.

297
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,750
Let's test the performance
of your brand new Gundam!

298
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:55,930
‐ Are these the same guys
that attacked the colony?

299
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,582
‐ I can't take this anymore.

300
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:58,415
‐ Micott!

301
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,510
We've gotta look for normal suits.

302
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,830
This ship could get a hole
blasted through it any second!

303
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,880
‐ Everyone, you have to put these on.

304
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,770
What happened to the other girl?

suits are still in flight.

‐ You, where do you think you're going?

307
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Put on a normal suit and get to shelter.

Huh?

00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,779
You dropped this!

00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,112
‐ Oh, thank you.

318
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,990
I'm glad you found it.

319
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,930
This might save my life.

It's my good luck charm.

321
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,090
Now, you go get some rest.

There isn't anything for you to do.

We'll take care of protecting
our ship this time around.

A kid like that piloting a Gundam?

Listen to me.

329
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,900
That machine's systems are registered

330
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,780
to your biometric data,

331
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,920
which means it can't be
operated by anyone but you.

332
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,080
‐ That's what I was told, but
how do you know all of this?

333
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,833
‐ I want you to come with me.

334
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,000
[booming]

335
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:42,312
[beeping]

336
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:46,820
[overlapping radio chattering]

337
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,260
‐ Damn amateurs!

338
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,620
‐ [Daguza] Don't worry, as long as

339
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,880
they believe we have the box,

340
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,390
they will try to neutralize our ship

341
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,940
without destroying our engines.

342
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,780
‐ I find it hard to believe
a single mobile suit

343
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,060
could neutralize the ship.

344
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,840
Ah, that says‐‐

345
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,460
‐ So, it turns out that the
ship is carrying something

346
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,020
that's almost as important
to them as the box.

347
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,860
‐ We can escape if we go now.

348
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,170
We could head back to Industrial 7.

349
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,950
You sneak onto a cargo vessel and find

350
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,150
some place to hide in one of the sides.

351
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,760
While you do that, I'll figure out

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,052
some way to dispose of that machine.

353
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,200
‐ Audrey.

354
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,020
‐ If we don't do it, that
thing is just too dangerous.

355
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,470
I can't let anyone get their hands on it.

356
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,000
‐ Now, just wait a sec!

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,460
‐ No, I will explain it to you later.

358
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,590
‐ If you won't tell me anything,

359
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,980
then how can you expect
me to agree with you?

360
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,230
Stop trying to convince
me by talking like this,

361
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,290
it isn't fair.

362
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,550
Audrey, what do you want to do?

363
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,880
Don't tell me what it
is that you should do,

364
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,480
your responsibility.

365
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,700
Tell me what it is that you want to do.

366
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,140
If you do, I'll‐‐
[whirring]

367
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:57,490
Wait, what are you?

368
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,820
‐ You know why I'm here.

369
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,160
‐ Audrey!

370
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,250
‐ [Woman] Trajectory set.

371
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,540
Catapult hatches one through four open.

372
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,300
Mobile shoot core, get
into launch position.

373
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:19,835
‐ [Homare] What's this?

374
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,960
Is the rich kid getting cold feet?

375
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,600
‐ I don't know what you're talking about.

376
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,330
But I'm pretty sure I
heard your voice crack,

377
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,309
Lieutenant Homare.

378
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,240
‐ [Homare] Just wait 'til we get back.

379
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,000
‐ Norm Basilicock.

380
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,800
Romeo 001, launch!

381
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:37,900
‐ [Pilot] Galom Gorga, Juliet 002, launch!

382
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,170
‐ Riddhe Marcenas.

383
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,080
Romeo 008, taking off.

384
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,561
[booming]

[gasping]

386
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,440
‐ [Homare] Severe damage,
port side catapult deck.

387
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,273
‐ Lieutenant Homare!

388
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,910
‐ Hurry up with that damage report!

389
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,662
‐ Get out of here and head to the moon!

390
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:04,390
‐ Mr. Alberto, it's
dangerous for you to be here.

391
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,880
‐ That's the Sinanju!

392
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,630
It's the Red Comet!

393
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,570
You can't defeat it!

394
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,000
[grunting]

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,770
Two years ago, our
experimental mobile suit

396
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,330
MSN‐06S was stolen by Neo Zeon

397
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,310
while it was being transferred
from the lunar city Granada

398
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,800
to a testing ground at Von Braun.

399
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,300
The Federation Forces that
were sent to get it back

400
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,880
were completely wiped out.

401
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,720
And they say the one
responsible is Full Frontal,

402
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,480
the man they call the second
coming of Char Aznable,

403
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,940
the Red Comet.

404
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,450
‐ I've heard of this story before.

405
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,100
The Ghost of Char, who destroyed

406
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,650
two Clop‐class ships with
a single mobile suit.

407
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,370
‐ But Char went missing during
the Second Neo Zeon War,

408
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,810
never to be heard from again!

409
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,260
‐ Be that as it may,

410
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,690
your men don't stand a chance out there.

411
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,240
Their mobile suits are useless.

412
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,770
The Unicorn was made based on

413
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,100
data collected from the Sinanju.

414
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,750
We've gotta get out of here, now!

415
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,530
‐ If we run now, then we'll
be attacked from behind.

416
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,070
Transfer the data to
each section of the ship.

417
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,010
Our enemy is not a ghost.

418
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,920
Send in the mobile suit corps, too!

419
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,290
‐ Idiot, you have no clue!

420
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,740
‐ That's the last time
you'll speak to me like that.

421
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,004
[guns firing]

422
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,754
[dramatic music]

423
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:38,073
‐ There it is!

424
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:40,323
[whirring]

425
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,060
‐ [Commander] Stay back, Ensign Riddhe.

426
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,320
Stay in formation.

427
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,019
Galom, below you!

428
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:54,186
[booming]

429
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:58,460
‐ That cannot be the real Char.

430
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,890
‐ Lieutenant Angelo, we
have multiple hostiles.

431
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,310
Shouldn't we cover the captain?

432
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,490
‐ Not at all.

433
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,430
We need only stand by
and watch, Ensign Sergi.

434
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,230
We'd only get in the Captain's way.

435
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,990
‐ At this rate, everyone will.

436
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,750
‐ Attention all attacking mobile suits.

437
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,200
You are ordered to cease fire immediately.

438
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,300
We are holding Mineva Zabi
captive aboard this ship.

439
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,510
I repeat, we are holding the
Zabi heir, Mineva Lao Zabi,

440
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,500
captive aboard this ship.

441
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,980
If you do not halt your
attacks immediately,

442
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,070
we cannot guarantee her safety.

443
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,903
‐ Hold on.

444
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:41,280
She's the Princess of Zeon?

445
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,810
‐ [Daguza] We are prepared
to begin negotiations.

446
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,810
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

447
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,840
‐ I have received the image.

448
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,910
I'm Captain Full Frontal of Neo Zeon.

449
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,130
Tell me, what are your demands?

450
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,360
‐ That's Char's voice.

451
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,330
‐ This is Commander Daguza Mackle

452
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,900
of the Earth Federation Space Force

453
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,010
Special Operations Group, ECOAS.

454
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,010
We are requesting that
you cease your attacks

455
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,630
and withdraw immediately.

456
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,870
If you do, we can guarantee
the safety of Mineva Zabi.

457
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,610
‐ [Full Frontal] Can't
we just have her back?

458
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,570
‐ Let's take one thing at a time.

459
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,920
If you allow us to pass,
then we can discuss that

460
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,870
once our ship has arrived
in a safe location.

461
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,410
‐ [Full Frontal] So you're
holding her as your hostage?

462
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,570
However, we have no evidence

463
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,250
that this person is the
real Princess Mineva.

464
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,350
‐ That seems rather cautious for the man

465
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,660
that people are calling the
second coming of the Red Comet.

466
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,690
‐ [Full Frontal] To you,
we're nothing but terrorists.

467
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,120
And since we are not a
part of your military,

468
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,540
we cannot expect to be
protected by international law,

469
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,610
so you can understand our caution.

470
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,480
‐ [Daguza] We have the highest
regard for human rights.

471
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,590
‐ [Full Frontal] Oh,
that's quite a statement

472
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,840
coming from people who send special forces

473
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,380
into civilian colonies

474
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,980
and are now using hostages as shields.

475
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,520
Now it's our turn to make some demands.

476
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,780
I request you hand over
the materials you collected

477
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,550
from Industrial 7 and all data
pertaining to Laplace's Box.

478
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,030
‐ And in exchange?

479
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,930
‐ [Full Frontal] I'll
guarantee your safe passage,

480
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,230
unless, of course, you
object to the terms.

481
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,020
‐ I have no objection, however,

482
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,770
we are unable to comply
because we never obtained

483
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,410
Laplace's Box.

484
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,480
‐ [Full Frontal] But you did retrieve

485
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,710
a Gundam type mobile suit, did you not?

486
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,510
‐ [Daguza] That's the
property of the Federation.

487
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,810
It has nothing to do with Laplace's box.

488
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,430
‐ [Full Frontal] If you
won't accept our demands,

489
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,920
we'll be forced to destroy your vessel.

490
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,480
‐ [Daguza] You would do that
with the prisoner on board?

491
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,350
‐ [Full Frontal] As her
identity is unverified,

492
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,600
she is irrelevant.

493
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,720
I'll give you three minutes.

494
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,870
I trust you'll come to
a sensible decision.

495
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,729
[dramatic music]

496
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,740
‐ He's bluffing.

497
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,450
He wouldn't forsake the
guiding star of Zeon.

498
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,302
‐ I wouldn't be so sure.

499
00:22:58,302 --> 00:22:59,770
‐ Hm?

500
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,400
‐ If Full Frontal is in fact Char Aznable,

501
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,570
he would be the son of Zeon Deikun,

502
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,100
which means he holds the
Zabi family responsible

503
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,230
for his father's death.

504
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,410
Why should he care about me?

505
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,860
‐ Interesting you should say that.

506
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,430
You've removed any doubt in my mind

507
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,630
that you are the princess.

508
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,970
And I'd bet that a good number
of those sleeves soldiers

509
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,230
out there still believe
in the Zabi family.

510
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,920
‐ If you believe that, then by all means,

511
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,100
continue this useless negotiation.

512
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,340
However, the soldiers of Zeon don't play

513
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,180
as nicely as you do.

514
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,010
If you were a Zeon, all
you'd be thinking about

515
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,020
is how to destroy anything
related to Laplace's Box.

516
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,990
‐ She's right!

517
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,350
We should destroy the
Unicorn's electronic system

518
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,980
while we have the chance!

519
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,430
That thing is the key, not the actual box,

520
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,370
so if we destroy it, then the safety

521
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,640
of the box will still be‐‐
[grunting]

522
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,680
‐ Let's put the resolve
of a Federation soldier

523
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,840
to the test, Commander Daguza Mackle.

524
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,200
If you have the strength,

525
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,820
then destroy the key and take my life.

526
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,590
Losing both the key and myself

527
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,850
will undoubtedly deal a
severe blow to Neo Zeon.

528
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,650
Otherwise, continue to wait for them

529
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,770
to storm in and take it from you.

530
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,470
There's not time for indecision.

531
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,333
‐ Audrey!

532
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,640
Stop talking like that.

533
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,130
You're only making it harder
for everyone and yourself.

534
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,150
‐ Banagher.

535
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,500
‐ Let's just go.

536
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,850
This isn't something you
should be involved in.

537
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,000
‐ My name is Mineva Zabi.

538
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
‐ No, you're Audrey.

539
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,920
I don't care what your name is,

540
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,430
to me you're still Audrey Burne!

541
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,263
‐ Enough.

542
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:48,100
Children shouldn't concern
themselves with adult matters.

543
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,050
‐ If I'm such a child,
then what about her?

544
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,710
‐ This girl is the princess of Neo Zeon.

545
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,900
‐ Well, if we're just children,

546
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,470
then why is she your hostage?

547
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,490
Is this how adults are supposed to behave?

548
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,190
Does being older make this right?

549
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,650
‐ [Full Frontal] Time's up.

550
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,940
What is your decision?

551
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,460
Understood.

552
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,210
Then we shall destroy your vessel.

553
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,610
‐ Here it comes!

554
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,650
Ready our defenses.

555
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,100
Mobile suit corps, be
prepared to intercept them.

556
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,490
‐ It's just a box.

557
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,810
Why can't you just hand the
damn thing over to them?

558
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,300
We don't even know what the box is.

559
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,920
Why do so many people have to die for it?

560
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,360
‐ So that no one else has to die for it.

561
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,410
While we don't know the secrets
hidden in Laplace's Box,

562
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,890
some say it could
overthrow the Federation.

563
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,570
What if we were to turn over the box

564
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,970
only to cause even more
people to lose their lives?

565
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,160
Could you take responsibility for that?

566
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,920
How would you explain
to all those families

567
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,770
that their loved ones had to
die because you didn't know?

568
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,993
Do it.

569
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,680
‐ Cease fire immediately,
otherwise we'll be forced

570
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,180
to execute Mineva Zabi.

571
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,500
This is your last warning.

572
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,780
Cease fire on us immediately.

573
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,550
‐ If we just take down
that red mobile suit,

574
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,440
then you won't need Audrey
as a hostage anymore, right?

575
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,697
I'll do it.

576

‐ Riddhe!
‐ This is all your fault!

580
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:29,980
How could you?

581
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,030
Did you really think taking a hostage

582
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,100
would work against a bunch of terrorists?

Commander Norm.

Bastard!

590
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,793
What was?

591
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,373
The Gundam.

592
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:29,560
‐ [Woman] The Gundam is on catapult one!

593
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,690
‐ [Daguza] What the hell?

594
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,260
Don't let it launch!

595
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,030
‐ [Woman] Gundam pilot, identify yourself.

596
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,360
You are not cleared for launch.

597
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,290
Return to the hanger bay immediately!

598
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,340
‐ You did this!

599
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,210
‐ This is a compromise that
could work for everyone.

600
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,330
The Unicorn's performance is unmatched.

601
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,220
Even a pilot with no training

602
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,540
can buy us enough time to get to safety.

603
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,080
‐ You're practically
giving the box to them!

604
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,330
‐ But it's only the key!

605
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,890
If the key is broken now,
the box will never open.

606
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,480
And the Federation's
interests will be protected.

607
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,580
That boy is never gonna give up.

608
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,180
I guarantee he'll keep fighting

609
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,440
until the Unicorn is destroyed.

610
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,040
You can hear me, can't you, Banagher?

611
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,240
You already know how to
initiate the system, don't you?

612
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,940
‐ [Audrey] Banagher, don't do this.

613
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,760
‐ [Alberto] That pilot suit you're wearing

614
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,460
has a medical subsystem
designed to reduce strain

615

on the body from G resistance.

616

But don't worry about it.

617
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,043
Once the NT‐D is activated,
it'll kick in automatically.

618
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,240
‐ NT‐D?

619
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,160
‐ [Alberto] That's the mode in which

620
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,470
the Unicorn's performance
limiters are disengaged.

621
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,010
You handled it the last
time, you should be fine.

622
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,990

I can't believe I fired.

It's the Captain's battlefield.

I've desecrated it!

632
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,130
I will make you pay!

[gun firing]

654
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:30,119
I got it.

655
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:33,040
This is it, Gundam.

[electricity crackling]

657
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,032
‐ So we battle again, Gundam.

658
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,280
‐ Pull back!

659
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,980
If you don't, they'll kill Audrey.

[grunting]

[guns firing]

663
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,673
Stop!

664
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:14,930
Don't get in too close!

‐ [Banagher] The Quad‐wing?

668
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,301
[guns firing]

[grunting]

670
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,724
Audrey.

671
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,940
‐ Why is that boy inside the Gundam?

672
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,100
‐ My thanks, Lieutenant Cruz.

673
00:33:58,542 --> 00:33:59,867
[grunting]

674
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:02,534
‐ [Banagher] Forgive me, Audrey.

675
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,270
[whirring]

676
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:45,450
‐ When I was a child, I saw
a Zabi family speech on TV.

677
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,700
Sieg Zeon, sieg Zeon.

678
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,110
I knew to be afraid even then.

679
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:56,540
A raving mob, thousands of
them, shouting in unison,

680
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,110
all because of your uncle, Gihren Zabi.

681
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,360
Neo Zeon still chant like
that, don't you, princess?

682
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,270
So say it for me now!

683
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,180
Say it!

684
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,540
Tell me something,
anything, to convince me

685
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,780
that you're the princess of Zeon,

686
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,420
because if you don't, why
would someone like Mineva Zabi

687
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,050
risk her life by slipping aboard

688
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,370
a Federation ship all by herself?

689
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,750
I guess we'll have to leave
getting the truth out of you

690
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,150
to the professionals.

691
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,130
There's just one last
thing I want you to know.

692
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,840
He was calling your
name until the very end.

693
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,700
Not Mineva Zabi.

694
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,750
He kept calling Audrey.

695
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,760
‐ You don't understand anything, do you?

696
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,753
And who exactly are these
professionals of which you speak?

697
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:53,580
‐ [Riddhe] We have investigators.

698
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,630
‐ Do you actually believe

699
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,860
they will conduct an official hearing?

700
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,100
They won't let the public
know I was ever here

701
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,780
no matter what happens to me.

702
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,980
You heard how stubborn Full Frontal was

703
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,510
in refusing to accept
that I am Mineva Zabi.

704
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,200
Why do you suppose he would do that?

705
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,470
‐ He was trying to, I mean,

706
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,400
he did it to undermine
our negotiation tactics.

707
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,460
‐ Take a step back and you'll see it.

708
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,850
How do you think I've managed
to evade being captured

709
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,320
for almost 10 years?

710
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,920
And how do you think Neo Zeon

711
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,180
has been able to establish military bases

712
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,840
within the Earth Sphere?

713
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,860
‐ Are you saying there've
been backroom dealings?

714
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,050
‐ The incident at Industrial 7

715
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,300
will disappear from your news reports.

716
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,530
It won't be easy for
the families and friends

717
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,580
of those who died to forgive it.

718
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,630
However, Spacenoids have grown accustomed

719
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,490
to dealing with injustice.

720
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,800
In turn, the Federation has
been using us a scapegoat

721
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,550
to channel their anger and frustration

722
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,740
about these outrages.

723
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,780
Until now.

724
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,880
‐ And Laplace's Box is what's
upsetting this balance?

725
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,180
‐ The Federation may
have begun taking steps

726
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,430
to resolve its relationship
with Neo Zeon once and for all.

727
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,250
That's why the Vist Foundation
is willing to sacrifice

728
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,100
the source of its prosperity.

729
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,580
‐ It sounds complicated.

730
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,080
I've always just thought
of myself as a pilot.

731
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,620
My job is simple.

732
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,020
Operate my mobile suit
and carry out any orders

733
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,300
I'm assigned.

734
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,770
That's all I have to worry about.

735
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,030
Even if there's been
corruption from time to time,

736
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,140
I've lived my life
believing the Federation

737
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,940
would do the right thing in the end.

738
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,650
But that's a lie.

739
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,600
Even when I was living under
the shelter of my family.

740
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,500
Even then, I tried not
to see what was true.

741
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,600
But you, what made you do
what you did, and alone?

742
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,110
‐ You know, I had to
deal with family issues

743
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,860
just like everyone else.

744
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,070
And my family shouldered the
blame for the One Year War.

745
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,520
I cannot separate myself
from all their politics

746
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,710
and if the same mistakes
are about to be repeated,

747
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,110
I must prevent them.

748
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,970
Even if doing so costs me my life,

749
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,780
I choose to take responsibility.

750
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,490
‐ [Man] Hey, Riddhe, there's
activity around the ship.

751
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,340
‐ The supply corps just came in.

752
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,400
They're probably restocking.

753
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,170
‐ [Man] And I killed the
cameras for you, too.

754
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,003
‐ I know.

755
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,270
You are still a member of Zeon.

756
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,180
Even if there have been backroom dealings,

757
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,280
you're an enemy here.

758
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,980
Your people killed Commander
Norm and the others.

759
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,030
And that is something I
won't be able to forgive.

760
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,040
‐ Of course not.

761
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,850
You said your name is
Riddhe Marcenas, didn't you?

762
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,860
‐ Yeah.

763
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,070
‐ So the family you mentioned was?

764
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,520
‐ I really wish we didn't
have to meet like this.

765
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,550
There's a lot I'd like to change.

766
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:55,841
[birds chirping]

767
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:09,717
[doors creaking]

768
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,267
[gentle music]

769
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,940
‐ They tell me there was
a room just like this

770
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,900
in the last fortress of the
former Principality, A Baoa Qu.

771
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,480
The governor general
of Palau is apparently

772
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,140
an ardent sympathizer of the
former Principality of Zeon.

773
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,440
I have to accept favors like
this location graciously,

774
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,080
even though the decor isn't my style.

775
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,890
I suppose it's a necessary
trade of a leader.

776
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,740
Good job, Captain Zinnerman,

777
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,260
and you, Lieutenant Marida.

778
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,470
I'll take it from here.

779
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,470
‐ Captain.

780
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,980
‐ I know.

781
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,900
Princess Mineva being held
hostage by the Federation

782
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,950
was unexpected.

783
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,460
We will have many
opportunities to rescue her

784
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,530
using both force and diplomacy.

785
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,910
Just be patient.

786
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,743
‐ Sir.

787
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:10,250
‐ Char Aznable.

788
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,180
‐ Come now.

789
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,060
Have a seat.

790
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,080
How are you feeling?

791
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,950
I've been told it was no small feat

792
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,900
to get you out of that Gundam safely.

793
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,360
‐ So, um‐‐
‐ Yes?

794
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,930
‐ Was that you, were you
the guy I fought with

795
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,380
in that red mobile suit?

796
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,470
‐ Do you have a problem
sitting down to tea

797
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,860
with a mortal enemy, Banagher Links?

798
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,840
You have good reflexes,

799
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,470
even if you're a bit reckless.

800
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,280
However, that's a temperament
not unbefitting a pilot.

801
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,000
‐ This might sound rude,

802
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,510
but may I ask why do you wear that mask?

803
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,610
Are you hiding a scar or something?

804
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,700
I'd like to see your face, that is,

805
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,020
if you have nothing to hide.

806
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,130
‐ You dare!

807
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,980
‐ It's fine, Lieutenant Angelo.

808
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,570
Banagher is right, it's
a matter of etiquette.

809
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,860
I choose to wear this
because it's my style,

810
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,410
but it serves as a tool of propaganda.

811
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,740
Most of the time I
forget I even have it on,

812
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,490
until someone like you makes
a point of mentioning it.

813
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,750
My apologies.

814
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,850
I've heard about how
you met Princess Mineva.

815
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,780
But as for how you came into
possession of that mobile suit

816
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,260
from the Vist Foundation,
the Unicorn Gundam,

817
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,940
there is much I have yet to understand.

818
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,010
The truth is, the decision to
turn over that machine to us

819
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,840
had already been arranged.

820
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,030
So what would make Cardeas
Vist suddenly choose you

821
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,360
to be the bearer of Laplace's Box?

822
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,630
‐ I was asked the same thing

823
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,710
by the two who escorted me here.

824
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,450
And I already told them everything I know.

825
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,910
‐ The prosperity of the Vist Foundation

826
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,820
was due to its pact with
the Federation government,

827
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,540
an arrangement held in place by their

828
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,590
secret possession of the box.

829
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,810
But they chose to end all
that and give it to us.

830
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,920
It must have taken something
significant to alter the plan,

831
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,790
but even if something had gone wrong,

832
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,270
why entrust the box to a stranger?

833
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,040
What makes the most sense is that

834
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,520
you have some relation to the Vist family.

835
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,353
Well?

836
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,550
‐ Is that a question I have to answer?

837
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,767
[groaning]

838
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,320
‐ I said that's enough, Lieutenant.

839
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,910
‐ You better learn respect, punk.

840
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,870
‐ Of course you're not
obligated to respond.

841
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,230
We simply want information
regarding Laplace's Box.

842
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,550
May I add that we're
asking you respectfully

843
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,040
because of your association
with Princess Mineva.

844
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,930
Please keep that in mind.

845
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,130
‐ Princess Mineva?

846
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,930
Audrey was very clear.

847
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,810
She said Neo Zeon must not get the box.

848
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,960
She said if they did, it would mean war.

849
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,350
‐ [Full Frontal] Oh?

850
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,620
‐ And after what happened
to our colony, Industrial 7,

851
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,300
anyone would feel the same way.

852
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,720
She's a Princess of Zeon, isn't she?

853
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,370
If Audrey's against it, why
are you trying to get the box?

854
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,890
Why won't you listen to her?

855
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,010
‐ Tell me, do you even believe in it?

856
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,600
In the existence of Laplace's Box?

857
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,550
Do you believe in the existence of a box

858
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,310
that no one has ever seen and
whose contents are unknown,

859
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,180
but nevertheless has the power

860
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,370
to completely destroy the
Federation government?

861
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,240
‐ Well, I...

862
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,250
I don't know.

863
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,930
But, I do believe that
even the smallest things

864
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,150
like knowledge have the
power to change the future

865
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,270
of the whole world in an instant.

866
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,430
‐ Such as?

867
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,410
‐ Well, like Zeon's first colony drop

868
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,840
or hitting the Earth with an asteroid

869
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,100
to start global cooling.

870
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,250
Or centuries ago, when
they made nuclear weapons

871
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,780
or discovered Minovsky particles

872
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,410
or developed mobile suits.

873
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,680
Even though it looks stable,

874
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,440
the world changes little by little,

875
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,900
right underneath our feet.

876
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,930
If an idea comes along at the right time,

877
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,180
it could have the power
to change everything.

878
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,150
‐ Absolutely right.

879
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,500
And you seem to know
your history well enough.

880
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,210
Are you aware that space immigration

881
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,010
was a policy of mass exile?

882
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,810
Even though the autonomy of the
Side settlers is recognized,

883
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,660
the central government retain the right

884
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,840
to appoint its leaders.

885
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,190
And since the Spacenoids
weren't allowed to vote,

886
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,190
they may as well have had
no suffrage whatsoever.

887
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,300
Not all of Neo Zeon adheres
to a single doctrine,

888
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,480
but what we do have in
common is the belief

889
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,310
that this unjust system must evolve.

890
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,210
In order to break from the
oppressive rule of the Federation

891
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,060
and realize the independence
of the Spacenoids, we've had‐‐

892
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,330
‐ But no one should resort to terrorism!

893
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,130
No matter how righteous you think you are,

894
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,440
you can't just go around killing people!

895
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,910
It's never right to take another life!

896
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,630
‐ You little hypocrite!

897
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,580
[groaning]

898
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,740
If it's never right to take another life,

899
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,210
then you're as guilty as
anyone for using the Gundam.

900
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,200
You killed one of our best men out there.

901
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,500
What do you have to say for that?

902
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,320
‐ I, what?
[groaning]

903
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,080
‐ It may have been a stray shot,

904
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,160
but that doesn't change the
fact that you shot him down.

905
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,630
‐ I don't think Banagher even knows

906
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,120
what you're talking about.

907
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,374
He was probably acting purely on instinct.

908
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:43,330
[groaning]

909
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,370
Ensign Sergei was just unlucky.

910
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,840
‐ No, did I kill him?

911
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,890
‐ Call for Zinnerman.

912
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,260
There is still so much
you have yet to learn

913
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,660
about who we really are.

914
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,150
I want you to understand us.

915
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,670
And it is my hope that given enough time,

916
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,720
we will one day work together.

917
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,900
‐ One more thing.

918
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,800
Who are you?

919
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,040
Are you Char Aznable or aren't you?

920
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,730
‐ As I am now, I consider myself
nothing more than a vessel.

921
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,750
A vessel for the hopes of
those abandoned in space

922
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,710
and for the ideals of Zeon that will

923
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,610
light all our paths to freedom.

924
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,790
So if that's what the people desire,

925
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,490
then Char Aznable is who I will be.

926
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,230
And that is the reason
why I wear this mask.

927
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:47,253
[doors creaking]

928
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,740
‐ [Man] Palau.

929
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,790
It's a civilian mining field asteroid

930
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,390
belonging to the citizens of Side 6.

931
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,260
Our intelligence agency has determined

932
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,350
that this is the location
where the RX‐0 was taken.

933
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,500
‐ You're telling me Nahel
Argama is supposed to

934
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,330
fight and break into that fortress alone?

935
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,163
Impossible.

936
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:16,910
‐ This operation is
under ECOAS jurisdiction

937
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,400
and reinforcements have already arrived.

938
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,670
Might I add, it is unprecedented

939
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,580
for two elite ECOAS teams
to join forces like this.

940
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,020
‐ [Man] And what is the
possibility of our success?

941
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,420
If we're supposed to recapture the RX‐0,

942
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,000
seizing control of one local
area's not going to cut it.

943
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,240
Have you even considered
all of the resources

944
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,480
we'll have to dedicate toward
preventing enemy pursuit?

945
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,000
‐ So do you agree to this plan, Captain?

946
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,010
‐ [Man] If we're going
to attack a stronghold,

947
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,670
shouldn't we be assembling
all of Londo Bell's forces?

948
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,920
‐ [Man] It seems like
headquarters is asking us

949
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,510
to die in battle.

950
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,760
‐ We're taking every
precaution by sending out

951
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,350
two teams of very
expensive special forces.

952
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,440
That's the best anyone can
manage for a covert operation.

953
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,370
‐ Nobody asked you for your opinion.

954
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,730
‐ The only reason the RX‐0 is lost now

955
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,666
is because of what you did!

956
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:08,820
[audience chattering]

957
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,820
‐ I realize this situation
is rather unexpected,

958
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,380
but if it hadn't happened,
that ship would have been‐‐

959
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:18,140
‐ I'll be back.

960
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:24,323
Damn it!

961
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,660
You call those reinforcements?

962
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,790
Covert?

963
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,983
Don't make me laugh!

964
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:32,890
It's just a bunch of washed up suits

965
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,580
spouting desperate excuses to make up

966
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,880
for their complete and utter failure!

967
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,950
‐ We've been made aware of
the orders from headquarters.

968
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,850
How do you intend on proceeding?

969
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,400
‐ Do you even have to ask?

970
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,780
The box is supposed to
determine the fate of the world,

971
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,730
so we have no choice but to go.

972
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,960
‐ I have no objection.

973
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,470
I agree with our orders.

974
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,500
However, if it's all the same to you,

975
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,140
we're choosing to look at
this as a hostage rescue.

976
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,700
We owe the boy that
much at the very least.

977
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,710
And I know how we can do it.

978
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,600
I believe this ship has been equipped

979
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,150
with a hyper mega particle
gun, hasn't it, Captain?

movement has me concerned.

982
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,010
Depending on the situation,

983
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,640
we might need to abandon this location.

984
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,880
‐ You think the Federation
is going to attack?

985

‐ How's the analysis of
the Unicorn Gundam going?

986
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,000
‐ Hey, are you from the Federation?

987
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,430
‐ Let him eat in peace, Tikva.

988
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,180
‐ I'm only here because these
people forced me to come.

989
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,110
‐ [Woman] Sit still and
eat properly, young lady.

990
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,330
‐ You a prisoner?

991
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,350
‐ Something like that.

992
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,120
‐ Well, then, you're lucky
that you ended up our prisoner.

993
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,900
If you were a Federation prisoner,

994
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,020
they wouldn't give you
anything to eat or drink

995
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,370
and you'd be tortured.

996
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,030
‐ [Woman] Tikva, that's not
proper dinnertime discussion.

997
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,220
‐ The Federation doesn't
do things like that.

998
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,053
‐ They do.

999
00:50:21,053 --> 00:50:22,520
My dad even says so.

1000
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,930
He was a prisoner on Earth

1001
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,300
and Captain Zinnerman helped him

1002
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,950
when he was locked up in the camps.

1003
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,760
‐ You know, many people's
friends were killed

1004
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,390
because of Zeon, and whole families, too.

1005
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,700
‐ Us, too, obviously.

1006
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,880
That's war for you.

1007
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,460
But Zeon did everything it could

1008
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,090
to fight for the Spacenoids.

1009
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,280
And you're a Spacenoid
like us, aren't you?

1010
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,490
So how come you're on
the Federation's side?

1011
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,220
‐ That's enough, young man or
you're gonna make me angry.

1012
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,250
‐ Does it even matter?

1013
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,000
Is war ever justified?

1014
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,170
Even if what we're saying is correct,

1015
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,910
that still doesn't change the facts.

1016
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,760
Zeon dropped an entire colony
and killed a lot of people.

1017
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,690
And all of those people who were killed,

1018
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,380
they couldn't choose if
what they were dying for

1019
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,940
was justified.

1020
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,160
They weren't told anything about it.

1021
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,640
Then one day, suddenly, they just...

1022
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,130
It's not fair.

1023
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,080
Not at all.

1024
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:15,380
There was nothing else I could do.

1025
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,200
I never intended to kill
anyone, but if I didn't,

1026
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,450
I would have been killed.

1027
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,980
I'm not.

1028
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,290
I'm not a murderer.

1029
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,010
‐ Come with me, now.

1030
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,310
I don't disagree with what you're saying.

1031
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,690
No war is ever truly justified.

1032
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,570
However, to save human lives,
we can't always be righteous.

1033
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,060
This was built back when Palau

1034
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,840
was still in the asteroid belt.

1035
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,910
When you look back at the
earliest space pioneers,

1036
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,570
they were mostly beggars
and political criminals.

1037
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,210
They sought to settle in space

1038
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,460
because there was nowhere
else for them to live.

1039
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,930
They say when the Universal Century began,

1040
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,460
the Prime Minister stated
that we were bringing an end

1041
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,760
to the era of God.

1042
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,730
For the people who lived
in the asteroid belt,

1043
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:30,470
the sun was indistinguishable
from any other distant star.

1044
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,340
They needed a light to guide them.

1045
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,430
‐ A light.

1046
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,970
‐ Nothing can live without light.

1047
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,800
But the people abandoned in space

1048
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,600
eventually found a new
light to replace God.

1049
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,460
And the new light that they
found to guide them was Zeon.

1050
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,190
It gave them hope where there was despair,

1051
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,960
so they could overcome the impossible

1052
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,110
and keep living in this cruel world.

1053
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,830
It held out the shining promise

1054
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,980
that we could all become better.

1055
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,000
You might find it
foolish to put your faith

1056
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,210
in something so intangible.

1057
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,590
There were those who would
say that ideas like this

1058
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,860
are not essential to life.

1059
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,820
I think that those people must be either

1060
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,230
very lucky or very deluded.

1061
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,900
‐ Humanity alone possesses a God.

1062
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,050
Somebody once said that to me.

1063
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,440
He told me about the power
to transcend the now,

1064
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,670
the inner God called possibility.

1065
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,730
‐ He must have been a romantic.

1066
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,180
A person cannot believe that

1067
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,190
without a strong faith in
humanity and the world.

1068
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,680
Sounds like a nice person.

Ensign Sergei.

1070
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,650
Don't worry about the lives
you take when you're in battle.

1071
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,900
When you go into battle, you
become one with your machine,

1072
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,460
a combat unit called a pilot.

1073
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,170
There's no room for regrets.

1074
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,710
That said,

1075
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,470
you are already entangled in the situation

1076
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,360
