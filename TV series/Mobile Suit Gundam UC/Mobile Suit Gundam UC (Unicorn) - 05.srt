This is Torrington Control.

State your affiliation and objective.

‐ [Voiceover] Torrington
Control, we are a transport

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,500
belonging to the Vist
Foundation on a special mission

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,940
from staff headquarters.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,360
We are now delivering a
prototype mobile suit.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,520
We're sending it to you on a Base Jabber.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,070
Transmitting the operation
code from staff headquarters.

Special mission queried and confirmed.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,780
Approaching Base Jabber,
descend to regulation altitude.

13

We'll guide you into final approach.

Detaching suit and deploying.

‐ [Voiceover] Mission? What mission?

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,410
Hey, approaching Base Jabber,

18
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,240
follow our control instructions!

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,540
I repeat, follow our control instructions!

[robotic whirring]

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,270
‐ Sir, the hatch won't open.

34
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,810
‐ But I gave you the release code!

35
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,150
I don't care how you do it!

36
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,360
Drag him out of there!

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
‐ Hey! Care to explain
what you're doing here?

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,007
And why's there a black unicorn?

39
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,590
‐ [sigh] Actually, we're
calling it the Banshee.

40
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,454
And it's far too complicated
to explain to you.

41
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:39,200
What's the delay here?

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,150
‐ Hold on a second!

43
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,520
[groaning]

44
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,140
‐ I'm afraid this is a family matter.

45
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,020
And I don't think the
military has the right

46
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,900
to meddle in one's family affairs.

47
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,070
Wouldn't you agree?

48
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,770
‐ What do you mean family?

49
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,190
‐ That's rather embarrassing
if you must know.

50
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,210
Banagher Links is the
illegitimate son of the

51
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,260
previous head of the Vist Foundation,

52
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,405
my father, Cardeas Vist.

53
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:21,270
So, I'll thank you to
stop asking questions.

54
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:25,099
‐ Banagher is‐‐
‐ The hatch is opening.

[ominous music]

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,780
‐ [Voiceover] It's rejecting
all external commands

57
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,157
and the system has gone
completely dormant.

58
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,280
‐ So now what?

59
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,460
‐ Well, our guess is that
Banagher Links has managed

60
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,350
to lock us out of the system,
but without confirmation

61
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,550
from him, we won't be
able to obtain any of the

62
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,370
new information that was
revealed by the La+ Program.

63
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,340
‐ I suppose it's in his blood.

64
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,880
You really didn't know?

65
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,820
‐ [Voiceover] No, I was
away at boarding school

66
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,730
when he was born!

67
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,000
So, I never even met him!

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,850
I can't believe this boy is actually‐‐

69
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,580
‐ He certainly has his
father's stubbornness.

70
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,640
If anyone could change
his mind, she could.

71
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,913
Audrey Burne.

72
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,300
As aliases go, it has a lovely ring.

73
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,720
‐ I take it this means
Chairman Ronan Marcenas

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,610
is aware of my transfer?

75
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,420
‐ Of course.

76
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,040
After all, we're working
towards the same goal,

77
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,510
Chairman Ronan and I.

78
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,983
[mechanical whirring]

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,220
We will seal Laplace's box for good.

80
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,616
I understand you left Neo
Zeon because you desired

81
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,560
exactly that.

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,550
At any moment, the boxes key, the Unicorn,

83
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,180
will be delivered to this Garuda.

84
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,810
Until that time, it's
young pilot will continue

85
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,680
to act as it's guardian.

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,560
I believe he's no stranger to you.

87
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,220
Am I right, your highness?

88
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,130
This Banagher Links?

89
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,950
Unfortunately, he's locked
access to the coordinates

90
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,000
that were revealed during
yesterday's battle.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,890
The bastard child inherits
the delusions of his

92
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,740
foolish father.

93
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,780
You have no idea how much
trouble he's causing us.

94
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,580
‐ That guard is...

95
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,680
Was his father?

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,030
‐ I have a proposal for you, princess.

97
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,580
Let's work together.

98
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,980
‐ You want me to convince
Banagher for you.

99
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,360
‐ I will make it worth your while.

100
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,070
I can also guarantee a
place for your ever loyal

101
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,130
Zeon remnants.

102
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,310
‐ If your offer is sincere,
you'll have no problem

103
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,880
releasing Marida Cruz first.

104
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,390
‐ Lieutenant Marida, or
should I say Ple Twelve,

105
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,560
is now working with us
completely of her own free will.

106
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,520
‐ You forced her to
undergo reconditioning.

107
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,180
‐ True, we reconditioned her,

108
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,310
just as Neo Zeon once did.

109
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,190
We can hardly be held
responsible for creating

110
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,163
that poor creature.

111
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:35,530
All I did was free what
was already within her.

112
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,520
I gave her the chance to
exact the revenge she desired.

113
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,996
‐ What revenge?

114
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:43,860
‐ Why, against the world
that created her, of course.

115
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,430
A world that is unfortunately ruled by the

116
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,880
flawed logic of men.

117
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,660
‐ [Voiceover] Hey! This is
rough on the captain too!

118
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,930
‐ If we don't have some
idea of what's going on,

119
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,060
how are we supposed to protect the ship?

120
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,750
‐ [Voiceover] I hate being
pushed around by them.

121
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,340
I mean, they're just civilians.

122
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,170
‐ Right now, we're working
under the direction

123
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,070
of the general staff headquarters.

124
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,559
So, you can think of the
foundation as part of them.

125
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,130
[chattering]

126
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,720
Londo Bell's mission remains the same.

127
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,550
Our job is still to stay on course

128
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,220
and hunt down the Neo Zeon
ship that infiltrated earth.

129
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,842
That said, there can be no
denying that the circumstances

130
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,513
under which we operate have altered.

131
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,930
[chattering]

132
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,210
We will launch the captured Gundam type

133
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,890
into space via shuttle.

134
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,540
Once that is done, the
Vist Foundation personnel

135
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,590
will disembark.

136
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,250
Despite any objections you may have,

137
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,760
I expect you to conduct
yourselves appropriately.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,850
You are dismissed.

139
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,030
‐ Sir, from what I'm
hearing, they're saying

140
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,700
the supplies that were
shipped to the Garuda

141
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,950
were fit for royalty.

142
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,220
‐ So, I guess the intel from
Luio and Company was accurate.

143
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,250
Well, are they gonna let me speak to him?

144
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,220
‐ They approved it almost immediately.

145
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,470
Though it would be wise to assume

146
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,020
that these walls have ears.

147
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,920
‐ And here I thought this was my ship.

148
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,650
I'd like a quick word with you.

149
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,180
Is that alright?

150
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,510
My name's Bright Noah.

151
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,360
I'm the captain of this federation ship,

152
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,340
the Ra Cailum.

153
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,250
I hear you're making things difficult

154
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,440
for your interrogators.

155
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,249
And your suit isn't giving
up any information either.

156
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:56,500
Our entire technical crew
is tearing their hair out.

157
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,260
‐ I can't let anyone see them.

158
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,740
If people find out what they are,

159
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,262
that place will become
a battlefield again.

160
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,600
My people will die just like Ms. Loni.

161
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,720
‐ Suit yourself.

162
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,322
Go on keeping that secret then.

163
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:16,020
So, did you escape that
camouflage freighter to get here?

164
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:20,030
‐ I wouldn't exactly use the word escaped.

165
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,930
It's more like they decided
to send me on my way, I guess.

166
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,080
To be honest, the captain wasn't happy

167
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,230
about the operation.

168
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,010
‐ Yeah, I don't doubt that.

169
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,420
Based on the actions of that
ship, I figured as much.

170
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,460
But if you weren't being
treated as a prisoner

171
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,070
while in their care, does
that mean they gave you

172
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,720
the freedom to do as you pleased?

173
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,150
‐ Yeah, you could say that.

174
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,010
I didn't get the sense we were enemies.

175
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,250
Even though I know the
federation says we are.

176
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,083
‐ Why was that?

177
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,930
‐ I think it's because I'm not a soldier.

178
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm not used to categorizing
people into friend or foe.

179
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,550
But there, while I was aboard that ship,

180
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,760
I didn't need to!

181
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,063
‐ Thank you.

182
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,610
I think I understand you now.

183
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,730
Don't give up.

184
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,750
You have strength, I
can see it in your eyes.

185
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,760
Strong eyes can feed off of adversity.

186
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,560
As long as you don't
give up, you'll be able

187
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,140
to make the most of what comes.

188
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,700
‐ It's not about strength.

189
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,730
It's about dumb luck.

190
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,250
Everything that's happened,
I had nothing to do with it.

191
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,810
Even piloting the unicorn.

192
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,010
‐ You really think that?

193
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,630
It may have been simply due to mere luck

194
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,750
that you stumbled across the
Gundam when you needed it,

195
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,450
but that's how it happened
for every single Gundam pilot

196
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,770
that came before you.

197
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,290
However, you still had
to choose whether or not

198
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,160
to get in that Gundam and that's a choice

199
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,990
you made on your own.

200
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,460
You, not luck.

201
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,370
At that moment, something
gave you the resolve

202
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,660
to pilot that machine.

203
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,493
What was it?

204
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,010
‐ There's someone I wanna help.

205
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,530
Audrey Burne.

206
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:11,590
She's the one who everyone's
calling Mineva Zabi.

207
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,630
‐ [Captain] Are you sure?

208
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,140
You're positive that General
Revil has been mobilized?

209
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,240
‐ It apparently received
orders from General staff

210
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,420
headquarters during
it's shake down cruise.

211
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,900
They clearly want it to carry out

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,830
some sort of covert operation.

213
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,360
‐ It's the Nahel Argama they're after.

214
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,490
Now, I see.

215
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,300
That's what they used
to bait Chairman Ronan.

216
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,400
Eliminate everyone who
knows the secret of the box.

217
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,790
That's the shared agenda
of the Vist Foundation

218
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,600
and General Staff Headquarters.

219
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,250
‐ [Girl] What are you planning to do?

220
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,810
The General Revil is the
key to the reconstruction

221
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,650
of Earth Fleet.

222
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,870
If it attacks, the Nahel
Argama wouldn't stand a chance.

223
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,750
If you're having trouble
making direct contact

224
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,810
from your end, our people
at Luio and Company

225
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,430
can notify them that they're in danger.

226
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,830
‐ Beltorchika, I wanna
get in touch with the

227
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,200
camouflaged Sleeves freighter.

228
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,033
‐ Captain?

229
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,510
‐ With Luio and Company's
contacts within the federation

230
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,410
and Neo Zeon.

231
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,730
It shouldn't be a problem.

232
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,180
‐ Are you sure about this, Captain Bright?

233
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,060
‐ I have the perfect
negotiator for the job.

234
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,430
He does hate Zeons with
a passion, however.

235
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,110
‐ This is in your best
interest too, don't you think?

236
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,640
You'd even call it a golden opportunity.

237
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,000
At least I would.

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,260
Once the key to Laplace's
Box is delivered,

239
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,170
those foundation people plan to take

240
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,430
both it and your princess into space.

241
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,210
If that happens, they'll
be out of reach for good.

242
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,000
‐ Give me a reason why I should trust you.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,210
‐ We don't like the Vist
Foundation conspiring

244
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,620
with General Staff Headquarters
and having the military

245
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,200
at their beck and call.

246
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,220
A certain field commander
also feels that way.

247
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,770
And then there's Luio and
Company, which could be called

248
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,220
the foundation's competitor.

249
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,350
Whatever Laplace's Box really
is, we just don't wanna

250
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,799
see the ties between the
federation and the foundation

251
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,370
deepening as a result.

252
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,070
‐ And to keep that from
happening, you'll get in bed

253
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,784
with the Neo Zeon and her captain.

254
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:12,820
I need you to provide
us with one Base Jabber.

255
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,100
‐ I'll see what I can do.

256
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,420
So, does this mean you'll be resorting

257
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,370
to your own guerilla tactics then?

258
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,210
‐ I'm just not sure we can
pull this off by ourselves.

259
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,120
Even if we hit them with a sneak attack

260
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,740
and recapture the princess,
it won't do any good

261
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,750
if we can't escape.

262
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,150
‐ And that is why I've been
calling this a joint operation.

263
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,360
I'll be sending you backup.

264
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,680
But it'll be from a ship you've had

265
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,610
a nasty run in with though.

266
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,470
‐ In any case, the first order of business

267
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,910
in times such as these is to remain calm.

268
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,230
We've been on standby for nearly 20 days.

269
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,520
It's understandable that you're antsy.

270
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,900
However, you my comrades
are their superior officers.

271
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,360
So, you must present
yourself with an air of‐‐

272
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,984
‐ Captain!

273
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:06,151
[panting]

274
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,380
Emergency message.

275
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,993
‐ Huh?

276
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:16,406
[clearing throat]

277
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:31,409
[spitting]
[screaming]

278
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,860
‐ No, I'm serious.

279
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,380
I'm putting my money on
that boy's intuition.

280
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:54,870
‐ [Voiceover] The course is clear.

281
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,230
The Azon aircraft for clear launch.

282
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,310
‐ Why do we need that pilot onboard

283
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,160
to transport the whiny one to Garuda?

284
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,860
‐ Who can tell with the top brass?

285
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,190
‐ Ensign Riddhe!

286
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,890
Where's Audrey?

287
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,310
You came to Earth with her, right?

288
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,360
So, where is she?

289
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,240
What happened to her?

290
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,130
Answer me!

291
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,443
[groaning]

292
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,530
‐ I need to borrow him for a moment.

293
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,076
‐ Whoa, careful.

294
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:40,180
The Earth's gravity can be a real bitch.

295
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,631
‐ What's wrong with you boys?

296
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:46,430
That man over there is
the captain of this ship.

297
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,860
‐ Audrey's there?

298
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,750
‐ No doubt about it.

299
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,220
The Garenciere is
planning a rescue mission.

300
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,870
It's scheduled to take place
during the Garuda transfer.

301
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,350
I suggest you work with them.

302
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,130
Once completed, join the
Nahel Argama, which will be

303
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,120
out in space waiting.

304
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,320
It's the only way you
can keep the box's key

305
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,640
out of the hands of the conspirators.

306
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,610
It's the only way to save her.

307
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,050
Can you do that?

308
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,500
‐ I'll do it.

309
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,660
‐ I'm afraid this is all I can do for you.

310
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,180
Just like every Gundam
pilot there's ever been,

311
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,760
I truly believe that
you were chosen by it.

312
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,050
This was the only possible
outcome for any of you.

313
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,000
Whether that be good or bad, who knows?

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,180
‐ Captain Bright.

315
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,800
‐ The rest is up to you.

316
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't let the situation
get the best of you.

317
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,580
Be brave enough to fight off despair.

318
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,060
If you're a Gundam pilot,
a Newtype, you can do it.

319
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:07,009
[mechanical whirring]

320
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:16,952
‐ Audrey.

321
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,433
I'm coming.

322
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,811
[intense music]

323
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,330
[glass breaking]

324
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,590
‐ [Voiceover] I will say this.

325
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,480
One has to admire your pride,

326
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,940
but your pride is about to
get a lot of people killed.

327
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,100
Do you understand that?

328
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,960
With your actions just now,

329
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,970
you've stolen the future from the very

330
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,840
Zeon survivors who worship you.

331
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,523
The only possible future
for them was to co‐exist

332
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:59,510
with the Vist Foundation.

333
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,190
A woman's pride can be fatal to a man

334
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,760
and you are blossoming into a fine woman.

335
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,030
Every blossom needs fertilizer

336
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,650
and that's what that boy's become to you.

337
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,154
‐ Banagher...

338
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:27,380
‐ What did the Captain say to that kid?

339
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,560
I don't wanna get caught in the middle

340
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,970
of any weird scandals.

341
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,210
‐ Hey, you think the
rookie knows what's up?

342
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,000
‐ Nah, I'm guessing he's also in the dark.

343
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,220
But Captain Bright knows what he's doing.

344
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,750
Whatever happens, don't panic.

345
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,750
‐ Ensign Riddhe, keep
an eye on the unicorn.

346
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,800
Remember, as long as the key is safe,

347
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,350
it should help you as well.

348
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,800
Your father's decisions are his own.

349
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,150
You're young.

350
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,630
Act according to your own judgment.

351
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,463
‐ Understood.

352
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,610
All that goes without saying.

353
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,930
Especially when Mineva is involved.

354
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,780
Taking off.

355
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,818
[intense whirring]

356
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,560
‐ All of your weapons
have been deactivated.

357
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,610
I suggest that you do not resist.

358
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,140
‐ Ms. Marida!

359
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,620
‐ I am Ple Twelve.

360
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,270
I do not respond to the name Marida.

361
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,480
‐ What are you talking about?

362
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,830
And what are you doing in
that mobile suit anyway?

363
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,320
The captain and the
rest of the guards here

364
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,599
are worried about you!

365
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,432
‐ Be quiet!

366
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:49,265
Don't talk to me like that.

367
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,370
‐ It's me.

368
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,750
It's Banagher Links.

369
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,070
Don't you remember?

370
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,500
I came to Earth with the captain,

371
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,621
your master?
‐ Ple Twelve!

372
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,171
‐ Do not pay attention to that boy!

373
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:00,590
‐ I understand, master.

374
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,170
‐ [Master] Is everything alright?

375
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,580
‐ The suit is perfect.

376
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,090
‐ [Master] I was talking about you.

377
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,050
If anything's wrong, however
trivial, do report it.

378
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,080
‐ Roger.

379
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,980
‐ If you're in pain, don't tough it out

380
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,640
and if something's bothering you,

381
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,578
please feel free to‐‐
‐ Is that an order?

382
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,745
[sighing]

383
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,873
‐ Ms. Marida.

384
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,123
[whirring]

385
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:28,755
Is that them?

[intense music]

387
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,450
It's the Garencieres!

388
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,780
The Garuda's defense
forces are engaging them.

389
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,570
I'm opening the combat bridge.

390
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,710
‐ Not yet.

391
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,580
Have the suits in Nigel's
team ascertain the situation.

392
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,230
The object of our mission
is to deliver the unicorn

393
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,490
to the Garuda.

394
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,290
There's no need to get caught
up in their little battle.

395
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,872
[intense zooming]

396

‐ [Voiceover] It's started, huh?

397
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,800
‐ [Voiceover] These Zeon
bastards don't know when to quit!

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,420
‐ All suits, hold your formation.

399
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,420
Don't let the unicorn out of your sight.

400
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,950
Stay out of my way.

401
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,505
[intense buzzing]

402
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:42,805
‐ Move the ship in closer!

403
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,320
‐ Are you really going through with this?

404
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,780
‐ If I can get aboard,
she's as good as ours.

405
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,882
‐ For Christ's sake, try
acting your age for a change.

[dramatic music]
[electronic whirring]

407
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,787
‐ What is this feeling?

408
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,210
‐ I can't let Ms. Marida and
the captain fight each other.

409
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,987
‐ [Voiceover] Watts!

‐ What the hell?

411
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,694
‐ [Voiceover] Watts!

412
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:20,146
‐ Ms. Marida, listen to me.

413
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,290
The captain is here.

‐ So he's refusing to kill, huh?

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
‐ He's going to board it in mid air?

[grunting]

419
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,760
‐ [Voiceover] Ple Twelve,
shoot down the Base Jabber

420
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,320
that's latched onto the Garuda!

421
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,190
That's the enemy!

422
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,353
‐ Roger.

423
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,084
‐ [Banagher] Don't do it, Ms. Marida!

424
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,746
‐ Great, it's Banagher.

425
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:30,579
‐ [Voiceover] What happened to our escorts

426
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:31,412
from the Ra Cailum?

427
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,395
That little punk used me as a springboard!

428
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,360
‐ [Voiceover] All craft are disengaging.

429
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,560
They're assisting damaged consort craft.

430
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,520
‐ So that's what's going on.

431
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,429
All of them are in on this.

432
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:43,340
Not if I can help it!

433
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:52,480
‐ Banagher.
[mechanical whirring]

434

launch has been pushed up.

If you'll please come with me.

[intense electronic whirring]

437
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,890
‐ My master's orders are to
secure you and your cockpit.

438
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,530
‐ Please snap out of this!

439
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,650
That's not your master!

440
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,920
He'd never ask that!

441
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:21,700
You and the Captain should
never fight each other!

442
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,400
Not after all you've been through!

443
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,762
‐ I am Ple Twelve.

444
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:32,470
My master is Alberto Vist.

445
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,570
‐ No you're not!

446
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,030
Your name's Marida!

447
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,680
And your Captain is Lieutenant
Zinnerman of the Garencieres!

448
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,970
‐ [Master] Ple Twelve!

449
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,090
Don't listen to him!

450
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,490
You'll only listen to me.

451
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,750
He is the enemy and he's
just saying those things

452
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,960
to confuse you!

453
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,310
‐ [Banagher] Try to remember.

454
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,790
Think about everything you and the Captain

455
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,520
have done for each
other, why you trust him!

456
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,920
‐ [Master] You don't need to
listen to anything he says!

457
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,282
You hear me?

458
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,370
The Gundam is your enemy!

459
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,090
You will capture it and bring it‐‐

460
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,923
‐ Shut up!

461
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:05,660
‐ Ple Twelve!

462
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,370
‐ [Woman] Can't you close that hatch?

463
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:25,709

[dramatic music]

468
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:43,826
‐ Ms. Marida.

469
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:52,048
‐ Gundam is the enemy!

470
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,693
‐ No Unicorn.

471
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,786
Don't let it suck you in.

472
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:00,619
Fight it!

00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,670
‐ [Woman] Ensign Riddhe,
have you thought about

476
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,080
what you're doing in your
position in all this?

477
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,817
‐ I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't.

478
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:23,235
And what would happen if you
killed Ronan Marcenas' son?

479
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,810
Have you thought about that?

480
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,900
You can have Banagher and the unicorn.

481
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,290
However, the girl is coming with me.

482
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,870
‐ Why are you still standing there?

483
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,400
‐ After you've taken me away,

484
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,210
what are you planning to do after that?

485
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,373
‐ I can figure that out
after we get out of here.

486
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:37,550
‐ Answer this.

487
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,480
What is it you're trying to protect?

488
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,570
Do you really wanna protect just me?

489
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,670
Or is it the secret of Laplace's Box?

490
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,503
Or is it your family's‐‐

491
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:46,140
‐ I don't give a damn about them!

492
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,785
The explosion that destroyed
Laplace 100 years ago,

493
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:52,810
that was the start of this whole mess.

494
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,413
My father, myself, even
all the people here,

495
00:28:56,413 --> 00:29:00,340
we're all just pawns of
it's twisted consequences.

496
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,130
But regardless of how twisted
this world has become,

497
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,890
10 billion people still live in it.

498
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,550
So, we have no choice.

499
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,170
All we can do is protect it.

500
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,220
I can't let everything fall into chaos

501
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,030
like the Zeon's once did.

502
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,100
‐ Exactly and that's why we must protect

503
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,901
the secret of the box!

504
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:19,440
Princess Mineva understands this as well!

505
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,410
That is why we should‐‐

506
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,320
‐ Shut up!

507
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,410
You've no right.

508
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,430
Your founder's the one
who's responsible for this.

509
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,870
It was a stroke of dumb
luck that your founder,

510
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,330
Syam Vist, stumbled across the box.

511
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,010
At first, everything went
according to his plan.

512
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,440
He used the assassination
of the first Prime Minister

513
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,450
and the resulting hard line
policies to gain power,

514
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,000
but then Zeon called for
space lord Independence,

515
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,498
the one year war broke out
and everything changed.

516
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:47,280
That's when both Syam Vist, who
came up with the conspiracy,

517
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,320
and the Federal Government,
which implemented it

518
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,160
realized what they'd done.

519
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,327
They understood the
significance of their actions

520
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:56,440
and the true power of
what Laplace's Box held.

521
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,002
‐ You know what the box is.

522
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:01,380
So please tell me!

523
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,248
What could it be that's been
causing you so much suffering?

524
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:06,790
This affects every one of us.

525
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,290
We all have the right to know.

‐ Mineva, please come with me instead.

529

The unicorn, it's dangerous.

With the revelation that
Newtypes actually exist,

531
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,130
the prayer of 100 years ago
was transformed into a curse.

532
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,480
So please...

533
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,900
‐ What do you mean?

534
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,055
‐ I don't have the power to
change the world on my own

535
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,750
even if it's an imperfect system.

536
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,811
If there's no way to
change it, I'll protect it

537
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:49,032
and that means, that
means also protecting you.

This is the light that will save me.

No one will steal it from me!

‐ No! Something's not right with it!

549
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,400
The light is really dangerous!

‐ It's not safe to be here.

553
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,340
The Unicorn and Banshee
might be resonating

generating a psycho field!

I've always believed that
even if it's a twisted system.

But if the only purpose of that system

is to stifle humanity‐‐

People don't believe that
the world will ever change.

591
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,160
And people don't care about
a world a century from now

that they won't live to see.

You'd be willing to fight for them?

Let's go!

651
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:07,160
Come on, Marida!

652
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,173
If you come back, it'll
be like it used to be.

653
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:12,423
[groaning]

654
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,060
‐ My master is...

655
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,330
My master is‐‐

656
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,580
‐ This is my daughter.

657
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,700
Her name is Marie.

658
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,690
If she were still alive,
she'd be the same age as you.

659
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,990
‐ Open your hatch and come out!

660
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,820
We can go back to space together!

661
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,900
Marida, please don't leave me all alone!

662
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:43,531
[panting]

663
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:55,900
‐ You damn Gundams!

664
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:58,519
Gundam!

665
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,602
Gundam, gun‐‐

666
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,860
‐ So I am a Gundam.

667
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,527
Then I am the enemy.

668
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,876
[intense whirring]

[intense music]

670
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,763
‐ Marie.

671
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,190
‐ [Girl] T‐minus 60 to reverse thrust.

672
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,390
Reverse acceleration protection set.

673
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:32,840
‐ [Man] Ballute is
prepared and on standby.

674
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,520
‐ Target's breaking away from the Garuda

675
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,880
and gaining altitude.

676
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,920
Amending estimated contact
point by minus eight.

677
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,970
‐ We're eminently positioned
to the upper thermosphere.

678
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,040
Then we could pull up the
target by tether cable.

679
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,320
‐ All hands, pay close
attention to the ship's altitude

680
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,330
and speed.

681
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,590
‐ The Garencieres, but that's the Sleeve's

682
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,120
camouflaged freighter.

683
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,320
That's the very same ship
that's been shadowing us

684
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,180
since Industrial seven.

685
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,720
Are you sure about this, sir?

686
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,080
‐ It doesn't matter if I'm sure.

687
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,320
It's a direct order from Commander Bright.

688
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,462
Besides, it's nice to finally
have something for a change,

689
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,820
regardless of what it may be.

690
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,435
‐ [Man] Target's engine
output appears to have fallen.

691
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:12,310
It's deviating from the
planned ascent curve!

692
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,290
‐ It's doing what?

693
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,700
What's going on?

694
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,470
‐ [Man] We're having engine trouble.

695
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,180
I can't get the output up.

696
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,870
‐ [Man] Do you think you'll
be able to pull it off?

697
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,480
We don't have enough fuel
to circle the Earth again.

698
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,220
‐ I'm doing the best I can.

699
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,120
‐ And right on schedule.

700
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,180
Our longtime nemesis is
right there to meet us.

701
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,640
I guess pulling this off
was too much to hope for.

702
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,410
‐ No, that ship, it's not
working for the Federation

703
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,960
nor Neo Zeon.

704
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,450
If we could reach them, it
might open up a path for us.

705
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,250
‐ It just might but‐‐

[electronic whirring]

708
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,804
‐ [Girl] Banagher!

709
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:00,023
‐ Kwani! Ivan!

710
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:00,973
What are you doing?

711
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,090
It's a crazy idea, but
Flaste, will it work?

712
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,550
‐ We're climbing now but we
still don't have enough power

713
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,000
to get back on trajectory.

714
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,980
‐ [Man] Can we decrease
our altitude any further?

715
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,120
‐ [Man] We're at our limit!

716
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,370
‐ Alright, deploy the cable right now!

717
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,820
‐ Firing tether cable.

00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:06,898
‐ Did the cable connect?

Your suit will be ripped apart!

728
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:19,275

What is it?

‐ Ah.

00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,630
‐ Who is firing at us?

739

‐ IFF code match found!

740
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,310
It's one of our own, sir!

741
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,430
They're in our flight path.

Dogosse Giar class!

00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:36,730
It's the General Revil!

746
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,510
‐ Are you sure about that?

747
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,743
‐ Positive, sir.

748
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:41,801
‐ The General Revil.

00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:42,930
I don't believe it.

So this was a trap after all!

755
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,800
‐ It wasn't!

756
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,060
Look at the way they're deploying.

757
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,343
They're also targeting the Nahel Argama!

758
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:11,346
‐ So, they're planning on
wiping us all out at once, huh?

759
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:13,418
‐ It can't be.

No way!

761
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,830
We were so close.
