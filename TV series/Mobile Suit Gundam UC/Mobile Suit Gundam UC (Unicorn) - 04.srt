I must say, I find this mutual mudslinging

It's obvious that's why

that you'd get yourself

You need to know the

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,090
within that machine.

168
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,590
Unfortunately, you were created by men

169
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,520
who only knew of spilling blood.

170
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,170
Since true life can only
come from a woman's womb,

171
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,050
don't you find all this unnatural?

172
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,540
Lucky for you, I'm going to
free you from that machine.

173
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,707
[sobbing and yelling]

174
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,330
‐ [Riddhe's Father] This
is a camouflaged freighter

175
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,170
belonging to the Sleeves
that landed on Earth

176
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,870
approximately 10 days ago.

177
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,240
‐ I did hear something about

178
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,000
the ruins of Laplace being destroyed.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,680
Are you saying these
people were responsible?

180
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,140
‐ I want you to use your
resources to locate them.

181
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,320
‐ In short, you want the Ra Cailum

182
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,180
to run a personal errand for you?

183
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,310
‐ The ship in question was also involved

184
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,370
in the incidents in
Industrial 7 and Palau.

185
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,070
As commander of Londo Bell,

186
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,780
aren't you concerned about the safety

187
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,450
of the Nahel Argama?

188
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,830
She is presently being
detained in the Earth's orbit.

189
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,280
You should know, this came from the

190
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,620
General Staff Headquarters by
order of the Vist Foundation.

191
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,220
I don't want it to appear
like we're taking hostages,

192
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,160
so I've laid all my cards on the table.

193
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,280
The Foundation is after this ship as well,

194
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,210
but if we take it into custody first,

195
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,220
it will give us the upper hand.

196
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,270
‐ [Commander] What's so
special about this ship?

197
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,800
‐ It's carrying Laplace's Box.

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,300
So you must seize control of that ship.

199
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,140
If you're unable to do so,

200
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,200
you are then commanded to destroy it.

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,580
‐ You give me too much credit, sir.

202
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,760
Granted, my career has
been far from conventional,

203
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,593
however I'm not‐‐

204
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:48,810
‐ [Riddhe's Father] It's
hardly surprising for a man

205
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,740
who has repeatedly
captained the motherships

206
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,610
of Gundam types since the One Year War

207
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,200
to be singled out as
commander of a Newtype corps,

208
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,620
don't you think?

209
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,140
‐ I suppose that's just my luck, sir.

210
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,280
‐ Well, if you'll make your
talents too well known,

211
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,940
there are those who will find a way

212
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,050
to take advantage of them.

213
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,130
I have one last favor to ask.

214
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,810
It's about that prodigal son of mine.

215
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,730
He's a pilot in the military.

216
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,540
I would like you to
take him aboard your...

217
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,373
What is it?

218
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,820
‐ [Man] I beg your pardon, sir.

219
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,010
‐ [Riddhe's Father] What is it, Doillon?

220
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,120
I told you I was not to
be disturbed unless...

221
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,953
Hm?

222
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,900
‐ It seems that the
Lady Mineva has suddenly

223
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,480
disappeared from her room.

224
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,880
We're searching the grounds
for her as we speak.

225
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,410
‐ Sorry to break this to you.

226
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm probably the last
person you want advice

227
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,470
from on this.

228
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,120
But the only way to get
the mobile suits out

229
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,190
is to crack the hull.

230
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,620
‐ We'll save that as a last resort.

231
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,570
Cracking the hull would
wreck the Garencieres.

232
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,370
‐ But sir, whether or not their
diversionary attack works,

233
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,620
we have to reconnect with our allies soon.

234
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,490
If we stay here, it's
only a matter of time

235
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,420
before we're discovered.

236
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,710
‐ I still can't believe they
hit Dakar of all places.

237
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,660
‐ Yeah, but they were itching for a fight.

238
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,940
Can't say I blame 'em.

239
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,180
Don't forget, the people
biding their time on Earth

240
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,050
missed out on two Neo Zeon Wars after all.

241
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,710
‐ [Man In Green] Even so,
we better make contact soon.

242
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,420
Who knows what kind of crazy stunt

243
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,620
they'll wind up pulling next?

244
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,660
‐ [Man In Red] There's an oasis about

245
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,420
60 kilometers east of here.

246
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,320
Let's make a quick trip
there by mobile suit,

247
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,780
and then we can make
contact with our allies.

248
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,100
At this point, wrecking the ship

249
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,380
is the only way we're
gonna get out of here.

250
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,213
‐ [Man In Green] I understand.

251
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,040
But without a way of
activating the Unicorn,

252
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,230
it's pointless.

253
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,240
‐ [Man In Red] We could
always tie up the kid

254
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,073
inside the cockpit

255
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,210
and have someone else pilot the thing.

256
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,160
The next set of the coordinates
the La+ Program gave

257
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,580
are in one hell of an inconvenient place.

258
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,920
‐ Give me the map.

259
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,753
‐ Hm?

260
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,020
This is ridiculous.

261
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,800
The Captain's lost it!

262
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,010
Why the hell is he
taking you of all people?

263
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,100
Hey you!

264
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,200
Don't be thinking you're so precious.

265
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,840
Who cares if you can pilot that thing,

266
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,340
we'll kill you just the same.

267
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,620
‐ You've got it wrong, I don't think that.

268
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,220
This is my fault, I know that.

269
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,740
I killed Mr. Gilboa.

270
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,130
‐ You bet your ass it is!

271
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,280
He could've landed us safely

272
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,780
despite your Unicorn grabbing on

273
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,700
during atmospheric entry.

274
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,710
If he had been at the helm,

275
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,078
we wouldn't be in this mess!

276
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:32,911
Gah!

277
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,580
‐ On the house, drink up.

278
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,360
I like the way you dig in.

279
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,580
It's nice to see a young lady

280
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,300
who isn't obsessed with manners.

281
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,510
‐ Thank you very much, it looks great.

282
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,450
‐ I haven't seen you around here before.

283
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,140
So, whereabouts you from?

284
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
You're a Spacenoid, huh?

285
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,270
No wonder I haven't seen you before.

286
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,110
You sightseeing?

287
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,160
There really isn't too much
around these parts to see.

288
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,610
‐ [Lady Mineva] I beg to differ.

289
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,910
As someone who was born
and raised in space,

290
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,130
I'm happy to be able to
set foot on real ground.

291
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,180
‐ [Restaurant Owner] Well...

292
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,940
Gravity hasn't exactly
been kind to folks like me.

293
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,340
Makes me wonder if my
back wouldn't feel better

294
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,530
if I were space.

295
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,470
‐ Does that mean you've lived
on Earth your entire life?

296
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,700
‐ Yeah.

297
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,890
I'm a bit too old to leave her now.

298
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,710
My generation was raised on stories

299
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,240
of the bad old days from our
grandfathers and grandmothers.

300
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
Things sounded pretty terrible back then.

301
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,680
They needed to figure out something new,

302
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,000
and so they founded the
Federation government

303
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,740
and the space settlement program.

304
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,570
And you probably don't know this,

305
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,130
most think it was only the poor

306
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,080
that were forced out into space, but...

307
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,700
The truth is, a lot of people
left Earth on their own.

308
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,520
They were prepared to stay away

309
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,150
until the Earth's environment
had fully recovered.

310
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,700
But then the One Year War came along

311
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,610
and undid most of the progress

312
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,260
that had been made on that front.

313
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,990
‐ We're hopeless, aren't we?

314
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,580
‐ Eh, what can you do?

315
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,880
It all began out of
good intentions anyway.

316
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,963
‐ [Lady Mineva] Good intentions?

317
00:15:45,963 --> 00:15:46,796
‐ [Restaurant Owner] Both those

318
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,390
in the Federation and the colonists

319
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,640
were motivated by the hope
that they could save humanity.

320
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,210
It's no different than wanting
your company to succeed,

321
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,580
or wanting to give your
family a better life.

322
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,780
‐ The way you describe it,

323
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,780
it sounds more like self
interest than self idealism.

324
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
‐ Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

325
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,010
But if we denied the people
the right to be that way,

326
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,380
what kind of world would this be?

327
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,010
I suppose there are people who can work

328
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,250
for the greater good even
at their own expense,

329
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,290
but I've always been
suspicious of those types.

330
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,710
Like that Char guy from Neo Zeon.

331
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,720
He claimed he was fighting

332
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
for the good of all people,

333
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,550
even while he was
dropping asteroids on us.

334
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,340
Truth is, whether he was
fooling us or himself,

335
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,860
that man never learned to love humanity.

336
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,287
‐ So then what do we do?

337
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,750
‐ Hell if I know.

338
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,780
And we still haven't been able

339
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,520
to figure that one out yet.

340
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,850
I'd like to think we at least tried.

341
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,950
And we can only postpone
paying the reaper for so long.

342
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,750
I spent my life regretting not being able

343
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,700
to do anything for you people.

344
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,660
In the end, the best I can offer

345
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,500
is just make you a cup of coffee.

I suppose you're right.

350
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:04,444
Is there anything I can really do?

[helicopters flying overhead]

352
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,880
The coffee was delicious.

I don't have any regrets.

354
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,940
This alone made my coming
to Earth worthwhile.

‐ Huh?

356
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,300
‐ Come, Ms. Audrey Burne.

‐ I am Mineva Zabi.

I'll be using her as bait

‐ [Banagher] Why, why pick me to do it?

374
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,210
‐ [Captain] Because you
look like you have the most

Damn it.

even if you weren't thirsty?

I'm sick of this, being

You're a pilot now.

390
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,420
So stop being a victim,

391
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,330
and quit your sulking already.

392

If Bilboa saw you, he'd
roll over in his grave.

‐ I didn't mean to kill him, okay?

394
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,620
When Mr. Daguza died, my
head went completely blank.

395
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,730
But if you can't forgive me,

396
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,100
then just put me out of my misery!

397
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,340
‐ Don't lie to me.

I see it in your eyes,

399

you don't believe that for a minute.

400
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,050
You have the look of someone
who decides for himself

how he lives and dies.

402
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,140
So as long as you're still kicking,

403
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,870
you might as well put on a brave face.

404

I piloted a mobile suit,
I fought and killed in it.

Tell me, what more do
you want me to do, huh?

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,880
In the camp, the treaty wasn't even worth

422

the paper it was printed on.

423

The people who dropped a colony.

While the big wigs were
negotiating a peace,

428
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,530
frustrating was building
up in the Federation troops

429
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,420
who were sent to occupy our homeland.

430
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,760
And they were your typical thugs.

They'd been brought up with the mantra

"Slay the Zeon Devils!"

433

"If you're looking for a good
time, find a Zeon woman."

435
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,020
They needed a scapegoat,
something to appease them.

436
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,400
Finally, there came a night when the town

437
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,370
was overrun by soldiers.

438
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,580
The elderly begged for their lives.

Crying children clung to their mothers,

440
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,590
and they killed every last one of them.

441
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,130
The official report said the troops

442
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,580
were trying to pacify rioting citizens,

443
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,090
but it was obvious to everyone

444

that what they were really
doing was blowing off steam.

445

The name of the town was Globe.

My mother and father lived there.

So did the Captain's family.

He had a wife, and a daughter too.

And in the end, the revival of Zeon

wouldn't bring any of them back.

And I don't give a rat's
ass what's inside that box.

Die in vain while cursing the world,

456
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,350
or fight an endless war?

‐ Because it's beautiful.

461

‐ Enough to make you think
that all those stories

462
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,320
about Earth being polluted were lies?

463
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,280
The thing is, the air around here

464
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,650
is even more polluted than it used to be.

465
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,420
And they say the desert has advanced

466
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,480
all the way to Dakar's doorstep.

467
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,180
It's all humanity's doing.

468
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,090

If humanity is the product of nature,

471
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,000
that makes all of mankind's wasted poison

natural products too.

473
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,080
And even if it's rendered
unfit for human habitation,

474
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,920
it'll be the result of nature achieving

475
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,330
a new balance, I guess.

476
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,430
Mother Nature does not
have an ounce of mercy.

477
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,360
Our ancestors were able
to understand that.

478
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,840
As products of nature,

479
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,890
it was something they knew instinctively.

480
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,820
‐ To survive, and to protect themselves,

481
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,170
they created civilizations and societies.

482
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,070
‐ Yeah, but what they
created got too complicated.

483
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,760
A society is supposed to serve the people,

484
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,000
not the other way around.

485
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,770
In the end, it made life
too difficult for people.

486
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,570
And to escape that insane world,

487
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,890
they went out into space
in search of a new home.

488
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,350
There, they created a different system.

489
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,370
It was natural that one would arise,

490
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,760
which gave hope to the
Spacenoids that were cast out.

491
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,320
It gave their lives direction.

492
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,200
That was what Zeon was all about,

493
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,340
but the old system that was
still on Earth rejected it.

494
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,860
Because systems born of
two different philosophies

495
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,540
can never be compatible.

496
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,840
The result is always the same.

497
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,850
One tries to make the other submit.

498
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,930
‐ Before that, a unified
government like the Federation,

499
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,610
and a world where 10 billion people

500
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,100
were living in space,

501
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,650
must've sounded like fantasy.

502
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,080
So isn't it still possibly
that humanity could succeed?

503
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,710
That one day they will be able to merge

504
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,520
the two ways of thinking?

505
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,340
‐ The government will never
treat everyone equally.

506
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,580
The hatred of the beaten and
downtrodden runs so deep,

507
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,000
it still clings to the
Earth to this very day.

508
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,230
‐ The situation's sad, don't you think?

509
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,130
‐ Yeah, I suppose it is.

510
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,560
Even though we live our lives
trying to escape sadness.

511
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,280
I wonder why that is.

512
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:06,033

[somber piano music]

514
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,778
Hey, Banagher...

515
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,310
‐ I know, I know.

516
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,030
You're gonna tell me
that a man doesn't cry

517
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,930
in front of others.

518
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:18,763
‐ No.

519
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,580
Crying because you care is
an entirely different matter.

520
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,950
I don't trust anyone who never cries.

521
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,240
That's my philosophy.

522
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,739
[sobbing]

523
00:25:55,745 --> 00:25:56,822
Banagher.

524
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:57,655
‐ Huh?

525
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
‐ I owe you one.

526
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,480
If it weren't for you,

527
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,990
I think I probably would've
given up along the way.

528
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,290
‐ Thank you.

529
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,420
But all I did was slow you down.

530
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,110
‐ Having someone who challenges you,

531
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,500
sometimes makes all the difference.

532
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,140
‐ Does this mean the
Garencieres has a new member?

533
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,130
You should stop picking
up strays, Captain.

534
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,000
That's it, you can stop there.

535
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
‐ [Captain] Good work out there.

536
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,970
‐ Captain...

537
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,030
Well, somebody I met one time
gave me a piece of advice.

538
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,410
He said to find a better way to use a Box,

539
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,280
so that must be my...

540
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,700
But where is it?

541
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,250
Tell me where the Unicorn's
next set of coordinates are.

542
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,180
‐ It's Torrington this time, eh?

543
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,680
This Box does have a way
of keeping us on our toes.

544
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,410
And I can't help wonder if Cardeas Vist

545
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,270
is making fools out of us.

546
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,220
Nicely done at Dakar,
Lieutenant Commander Kirks.

547
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,550
Thanks to you, we
successfully distracted them

548
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,380
with your Earth Zeon Remnants,

549
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,410
and therefore were able to
protect the Garencieres.

550
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,610
You have my gratitude.

551
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,780
‐ Sir, and you ours.

552
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,040
The Zee Zulus proved to be
rather formidable assets, sir.

553
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,380
‐ Ah, you must be Ensign Loni Garvey.

554
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,570
I am familiar with your father.

555
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,510
He has done us a grave service,
perfecting Haman's legacy.

556
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,780
‐ Captain.

557
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,040
I have one goal.

558
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,030
It is to settle that
scores that haunt the souls

559
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,097
of my father, mother, and my people.

560
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:26,950
‐ Loni!

561
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,680
‐ I would like to request
that you assign us

562
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,540
to aid in the mission
to attack Torrington.

563
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,930
If we dispatch that
Split‐horn Gundam there,

564
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,550
we could probably learn the whereabouts

565
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,970
of Laplace's Box.

566
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,900
‐ Granted.

567
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,860
I am the leader of Neo Zeon,

568
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,520
and we've made our stronghold in space.

569
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,160
But I have no right to give orders

570
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,450
to those who have been
embroiled in guerrilla warfare

571
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,100
on Earth since the One Year War.

572
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,230
‐ In that case, may I take that to mean

573
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,740
that you have no right to stop us either?

574
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,910
‐ May the heavens bless
and protect the heir

575
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,650
to Mahdi's cause.

576
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,900
‐ Sieg Zeon!

577
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:12,664
‐ Captain, are you sure about this?

578
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:14,870
Dakar was bad enough, but this is‐‐

579
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,000
‐ I understand your misgivings.

580
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,260
Nevertheless, they have
been waiting all this time.

581
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,140
Time has stood still for them.

582
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,680
And people can grow accustomed to waiting.

583
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,750
I suspect that they could've
gone on waiting forever.

584
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,470
However, time has begun to flow again.

585
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,350
All because of Cardeas Vist.

586
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,450
No dam could hold back this river,

587
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,320
and doing nothing will
only muddy the waters.

588
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,410
Do you not agree, Captain?

589
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,590
And to ensure that does not happen,

590
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,360
I have yet another job for
you and the Garencieres.

591
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,893
‐ Can you take that?

592
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:52,726
‐ Sure thing.

593
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,440
‐ So you're the pilot of the Split‐horn.

594
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,380
The key to the Box.

595
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,213
‐ [Banagher] What do you mean?

596
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:01,530
‐ Don't disappoint me.

597
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,330
‐ [Bystander] They say she was the one

598
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,780
who piloted the behemoth at Dakar.

599
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,310
‐ Message from Kirks Team!

600
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,310
‐ [Officer] The ones who attacked Dakar?

601
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,010
‐ It's code used by the old Principality.

602
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,930
It's an old watchword.

603
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,270
It dates back to when our forces

604
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,690
first came down to Earth
during the One Year War.

605
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,800
‐ Well, what does it say?

606
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,090
‐ "Help our cause, let's
give the Feds a shock."

607
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,300
"They won't expect what's next,

608
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,142
Dakar was only the beginning!"

‐ [Submarine Worker] Can we
launch our reserve suits?

620
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,380
‐ [Submarine Worker 2] Flooding underway,

622
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,130
‐ We're supposed to have dropped this off

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,090
at the coordinate point

624
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,880
once our allies have captured the base,

625
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,270
then wait to see if it reveals any data.

626
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,240
Ivan's gonna be our escort there.

627
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,140
Something wrong, Banagher?

628
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,950
‐ I just think it's strange.

629
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,370
This is a Zeon weapon,

630
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,440
why does it fit a Federation mobile suit?

631
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,900
‐ [Man] Well, they both
use the universal standard,

632
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,030
so of course they're compatible.

633
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,160
‐ But if they can make
their machines compatible,

634
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,290
why can't they find a
way to stop fighting?

635
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,650
‐ I don't know, but it was the
one thing that got resolved

636
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,450
in the course of all that fighting.

637
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,870
It was a matter of efficiency.

638
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,520
‐ In other words, it
benefited Anaheim Electronics.

639
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,720
‐ Well, it worked better in the field too.

640
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,920
I mean, it's helping
us right now, isn't it?

641
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,080
‐ [Riddhe] Is that it?

642
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:19,880
‐ Whoa.

643
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,870
‐ The kid's good.

644
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,870
‐ New Guinea, that's our destination.

645
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,850
We have a missing ship in
the Coral Sea, Bonefish.

646
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,070
Federation forces submarine.

647
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,750
Given the state of those waters,

648
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,240
there's a strong possibility she was sunk.

649
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,860
If its disappearance is linked
to the ship we're hunting,

650
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,530
it's possible we'll have
to engage enemy forces.

651
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,680
Our priority is the
procurement of Laplace's Box,

652
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,110
but we may not have that luxury.

653
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,700
Stay sharp out there.

654
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,533
‐ Roger.

655
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,150
Captain Bright?

656
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,500
‐ What is it?

657
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,210
‐ Speaking freely, I
have a request of you.

658
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,130
Don't give me special treatment.

659
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,720
Regardless of my background,

660
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,490
I am first and foremost an E. F. S. F pilot.

661
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,140
I implore you not to keep
me off dangerous missions‐‐

662
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,130
‐ That's enough.

663
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,740
Listen to yourself.

664
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,530
The only one giving you special treatment

665
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,070
around here is you.

666
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,250
I've no reason to play favorites.

667
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,330
I could care less who you are.

668
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,540
If I need you, I'll use you.

669
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,210
However, if I send you
out, come back alive.

670
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,650
That's what makes a pilot.

671
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,320
If you can do that, then
I'll treat you like one.

672
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,153
‐ Yes sir.

673
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,770
‐ It's me.

674
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,400
Put me through.

675
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,233
Bright here.

676
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,580
Come again?

677
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,510
‐ [Man In Red] Why there of all places?

678
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,840
‐ It's where the colony was dropped.

679
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,720
Damn that Cardeas Vist.

680
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,610
What's he trying to make us do,

681
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,440
force us to retrace humanity's downfall?

682
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,310
‐ Hey, you don't have
to worry about the kid.

683
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,420
‐ [Captain] But if he turns on us

684
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,460
while in that suit,

685
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,440
we wouldn't be able to stop him.

686
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,290
‐ At least for now, he's got
total faith in you, Captain.

687
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,479
‐ [Banagher] Ms. Loni...

688
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:19,396
[loud explosions]

689
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:43,654
[intense instrumental music]

690
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,780
‐ [Fighter] Massive
mobile armor approaching

691
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,771
from the shore.

692
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:38,021
Torrington base, requesting assistance!

693
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,992
[loud explosions]

694
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,660
[intense instrumental music]

695
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,080
‐ Russet, Candor, the next
wave is coming, scatter.

696
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,730
Loni, avoid the city!

697
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,910
‐ This is the most
direct route to the base.

698
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,090
Have you forgotten what
the Federation did to us?

699
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,070
‐ [Kirks] We don't want
unnecessary casualties,

700
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,980
keep your cool!

701
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,813
‐ Roger.

702
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,196
‐ [Kirks] What's wrong, Loni?

703
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:29,029
‐ Father?

704
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,620
[intense instrumental music]

705
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:50,569
[loud explosions]

706
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,520
‐ A runaway Psycommu.

707
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,160
Could it actually be thirsty for blood?

708
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,700
‐ This is...

709
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,350
A slaughter.

710
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,590
Nothing but a slaughter.

711
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,750
‐ This doesn't strike me as something

712
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,170
that Char's successors would do.

713
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,003
How many?

714
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:12,750
‐ [Woman] There appear to
be four small transports,

715
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,840
and one mid‐sized VTOL
craft above the area, sir.

716
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,100
‐ If that thing's the
camouflaged freighter,

717
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,670
that would be some dumb luck.

718
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,920
Think it's possible?

719
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,400
‐ [Woman] I've intercepted
the enemy's trunk line, sir.

720
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,980
‐ This the group that attacked Dakar?

721
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,160
All hands, level two battle stations!

722
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,990
Put the mobile suits on standby!

723
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,870
Could these people be
connected to the Box too?

724
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,170
‐ Audrey...

725
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,510
You and I, we can't escape the curse

726
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,490
that we each were born into.

727
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,480
Does this mean I'm just
fighting the inevitable?

728
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,800
‐ Hey there, newbie!

729
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,520
If you slow us down, I won't hesitate

730
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,930
to shoot you in the back.

731
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,150
Don't you forget that.

732
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,540
‐ [Raddhe] You got a great team here,

733
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,880
too bad I'm not a part of it.

734
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,380
‐ You can join whenever you want.

735
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,500
You know, all you have to do

736
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,980
is shoot one of us in the back.

737
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,420
‐ That sure is enticing.

738
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,240
‐ [Pilot] Pilots have to
believe their orders are sound,

739
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,150
even if their bosses are morons.

740
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,160
We're rather fortunate if you ask me.

741
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,880
At least we get to
serve under a great C. O.

742
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,510
‐ The C. O. of the Gundam Corps.

743
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,600
The Gundam, the key to the Box.

744
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,089
‐ [Fighter] Finish them all off!

745
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,503
[gunshots firing]

746
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,210
[intense instrumental music]

00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:58,589
[loud yelling]

749
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,670
‐ What are you doing!

750
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,120
I'm going out in the Unicorn.

751
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,220
If I can break the La+ Program's seal,

752
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,240
you'll have no reason to
keep up this attack, right?

753
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
‐ Settle down.

754
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,380
You go out there now, those
flak guns will shoot you down.

755
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,100
Wait 'til we've mopped up.

756
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,780
‐ What do you mean mopped up?

757
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,810
Innocent people are dying out there,

758
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,710
don't you care?

759
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,920
‐ This is an operation.

760
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,880
My opinions are not relevant.

761
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,540
Stay put.

762
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,390
We didn't tie you up
and force you to come.

763
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,370
If you didn't expect something like this,

764
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,700
you have a serious lack of imagination.

765
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,920
This is what happens when
you seize enemy territory.

766
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,670
‐ Attacking innocent civilians,

767
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,510
decimating fleeing people?

768
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,670
How can you even blame this on war?

769
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,560
This is just an act of vengeance!

770
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,860
That first time we met,
back at Industrial 7,

771
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,720
you chose not to shoot me.

772
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,870
I know you, it's eating you up inside.

773
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,300
So make them stop!

774
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,020
Cause if this is your idea of war,

775
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,460
then why did you take me
with you across the desert?

776
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,700
Why did you save Ms. Marida?

777
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,790
She doesn't call you master

778
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,340
because she's a cyber‐Newtype,

779
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,650
it's because you saved
her like you did me.

780
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,080
It's because you touched her heart

781
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,340
just like you touched mine!

782
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,780
‐ Shut the hell up!

783
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,600
I won you over because I thought

784
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,370
it would make my job easier.

785
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,010
I was concerned about your well being

786
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,810
because you're the key to the Box!

787
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,980
So you don't think this is really war?

788
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,780
Well open your eyes and take a good look!

789
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,140
This is war, there are no principles,

790
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,160
no dignity, no honor.

791
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,470
Some kill, others are killed.

792
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,920
It's as simple as that.

793
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,800
And what's wrong with vengeance?

794
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,830
This war of ours is a
long way from being over.

795
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,890
‐ Your thinking.

796
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,090
That's how the Federation
soldiers rationalized

797
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,600
burning down the Zeon town!

798
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:06,698
[intense instrumental music]

799
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,531
[gunshots firing]

800
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,481
‐ [Man] See you soon, Louise!

801
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,840
‐ Even though people are sad,

802
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,680
we live our lives trying
to escape sadness,

803
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,910
you told me that!

804
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,420
You know this is pointless!

805
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,090
What you're doing, none of it is

806
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,390
going to accomplish anything!

807
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,330
‐ What would a kid like you know?

808
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,100
My whole team, we've been
waiting for this moment

809
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,640
for a long time!

810
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,850
So long, that I'm dying
to be out there myself.

811
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,170
‐ You don't have the right.

812
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,730
Just because you've been through hell,

813

Flaste!

‐ Sorry Captain, I've got
my hands full right now.

820
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,770
You're gonna have to take
care of the kid yourself.

‐ I don't get it.

823
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,140
I just, I don't understand it.

824
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,800
It's true, life can be sad.

825
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,280
It could also be filled with pain.

826
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,610
But even so, we can't close
our hearts off because of it!

827
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,240
Other's sadness, I don't
want to forget that.

828
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,070
It's because we have hearts
that we can feel sadness.

829
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,580
And that's the reason
I want to become a man

830
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,470
who can acknowledge that sadness!

831
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,260
The kind of man you are, Captain!

Leave from the east side
and head for the base!

‐ [Tomura] Are you sure about this?

844

If I drop him now,
he'll be a sitting duck.

You should let the kid do what he wants.

848
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,693
Right, Captain?

00:44:14,894 --> 00:44:16,311
‐ [Captain] Hmph.

850
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,390
‐ Captain, everyone in the Garencieres,

851
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,490
thanks for everything.

Banagher Links, Unicorn Gundam, here I go!

‐ Launch!

854
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:35,180
‐ I'm not the key to some Box, I'm human.

855
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,440
And you're a machine, built
to amplify human abilities.

856
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,300
That's what you were built for.

857
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,150
For those of us who can sense
what's in other's hearts,

858
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,500
other people's sadness.

859
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,570

break the Box's seal,

865
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,710
you better all fall back.

866
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,930
‐ Why is the Box's key getting in the way?

867
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:29,106
‐ [Loni] Kirks!

868
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:30,456
‐ [Kirks] Loni, what is it?

869
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:34,398
‐ [Loni] The Split‐horn opened fire on me!

870
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,770
‐ Why would it do that?

871
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,070
Loni, we gotta go!

872
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,640
‐ We've taken a long,
treacherous road to get here.

873
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,550
I'll crush anything in my way!

874
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,769
‐ I don't like this.

875
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:51,630
‐ [Fighter] What is this?

876
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,430
Some kind of walking war museum?

877
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,620
‐ [Fighter 2] They got guts attacking

878
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,950
in ancient suits like those.

879
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,880
‐ [Fighter] That's why we
can't let our guard down.

880
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,030
Clearly these guys are
crazier than we are.

881
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,030
‐ [Banagher] Stop it,
why are you doing this?

882
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,244
‐ [Loni] I've waited my
whole life for this moment.

883
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:09,077
‐ Banagher?

884
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:10,850
‐ I owe you all a debt of gratitude.

885
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,640
As a result of the Garencieres
crashing into the desert,

886
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,880
we've finally been able
to take our revenge.

887
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,460
You're a bit too late.

888
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,380
If you stop me now, all of this will truly

889
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,780
have been for nothing.

890
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,930
So move it!

891
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,460
Hurry up and activate
the Split‐horn already!

892
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,380
‐ Stop this.

893
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,600
All the dead you're
responsible for here today,

894
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,016
their families will be filled
with hatred for your people!

‐ Stop this, now!

898
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,150
If you keep fighting like this,

899
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,330
it'll harden your heart

900
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,090
and you'll lose your humanity!

‐ Shut up!

902
00:47:01,923 --> 00:47:03,580
My father and mother were hunted down

903
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,290
for being Zeon Remnants.

00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,350
Nobody gave them a choice to surrender,

they were slaughtered like animals.

We have to take it out.

That isn't her, she's being enslaved.

Think about it, is this
what you really want?

Is this what the real you truly wants?

Ms. Loni!

928

‐ But this is all I have, so...

929
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,650
Without this, I have nothing
to live for, nothing!

It's too sad to live only
for hatred and anger!

to be angered by injustice.

I'll make you pay, I'll make
you pay, I'll make you pay!

978
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,920
‐ This dark feeling that's inside you...

979
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,160
Don't let it take over your heart.

980
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,520
It won't do any good.

Don't let it consume you, fight it!

‐ For children to be consumed

984
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,530
by their parent's wishes
is the way of the world.

985
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,960
I'm not wrong to feel the way I do.

986
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,550
‐ [Banagher] What they left you
is not a wish, it's a curse!

‐ It's the same!

988

Our parents gave us life.

We're bound by blood to
carry out their wishes.

990

Curse or not, it's our duty!

991
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,090
You're a hypocrite,

992
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,490
your power was given to
you by your parents too!

993
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,610
It's mine, this is my fight and my war!

994
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:23,570
‐ Get on board, Banagher!

995
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:27,540
We have to be faster
than the reaction time

00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,830
of those reflectors.

How's your beam magnum?

00:53:34,306 --> 00:53:36,020
It's the only way to protect the city.

1003
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,200
Let's circle around, then
charge straight at the chest.

1004
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,140
Split up as we pass,

1005
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,440
then break through with
a simultaneous attack.

Sieg Zeon, Sieg Zeon,

Sieg Zeon, Sieg Zeon...

1009
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,445
‐ Come back, don't do this!

1010
00:54:12,445 --> 00:54:13,632
‐ Give it up already!

1011
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:16,465
‐ Sieg Zeon, Sieg Zeon, Sieg Zeon!

1012
00:54:18,803 --> 00:54:21,291
‐ Loni, it's time to go.

1013
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,138
Our war is over.

‐ Banagher, what are you waiting for?

1018
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,010
You're willing to die for possibility?

1019
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,361
It's meaningless, let it go!

Isn't it sad?

armors have stopped moving.

The other Zeon Remnant mobile suits

‐ Flaste.

1031
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,340
Take us out of this airspace.

‐ [Riddhe] Come out of there, Banagher.

I have direct orders to seize that Gundam.

Hand over that suit.

This is all because of you.

If it weren't for you,

none of this would've happened.
