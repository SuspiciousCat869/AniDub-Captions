1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,920
‐ [Narrator] It is now
23:40 Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,650
We are about to witness the
end of the world as we know it

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,350
and usher in a new world
as never before imagined.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,720
The Earth Federation government
is about to host a ceremony

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,640
at the prime minister's
residence, Laplace,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,050
to celebrate the birth of a new era.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,210
The ingenuity of mankind has allowed us

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,170
to move beyond Mother Earth

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,760
and build worlds of our own to inhabit.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,660
Tonight, we'll mark the
beginning of a new epoch.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,140
Let us come together in this joyous moment

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,490
to honor the past, the era of Anno Domini,

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,010
and greet the dawn of
the Universal Century

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,940
with open hearts and minds.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,210
So with great enthusiasm,
let us open the door

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,480
to our future together.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,890
Farewell, Anno Domini, and
welcome Universal Century.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,200
‐ Greetings, citizens of Earth and space.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,980
I am Ricardo Marcenas,

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,730
prime minister of the Earth Federation.

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,010
It is with great pride that
I stand before you tonight.

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,790
In a matter of mere moments,

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,529
the era of Anno Domini
will fade into history.

24
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:10,087
In the past, presidents
and prime ministers

25
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:13,100
addressed the citizens of
their respective countries.

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,279
Each country had its own
people, its own territories

27
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,999
originally created to
protect their interests,

28
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:21,879
and defend against attacks
from other countries,

29
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,967
but when you look at the Earth from space,

30
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,300
you can't see those dividing lines.

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,700
And now that we've made mankind's dream

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,220
of a unified world government a reality,

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,280
we are no longer bound by the antiquated

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,620
nation‐state system.

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,529
And just as no man is
an island unto himself,

36
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:40,390
no one being can survive without
coexisting with the others.

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,980
Now that we must face dangers

38
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,812
that threaten our planet as a whole,

39
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:47,220
the entirety of our people
can face them as one.

40
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,399
The old nations of Earth were incapable

41
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,082
[speaking drowned out by warbling]

42
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,710
to create effective solutions.

43
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,072
[glass shattering]
[loud rumbling]

44
00:01:57,072 --> 00:02:00,299
[people screaming]

45
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,966
[loud blasting]

46
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:11,269
[loud blasting]

47
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:48,774
[pensive orchestral music]

48
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:55,951
[footsteps approaching]

49
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,034
‐ Well, then?

50
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,590
‐ We're going to proceed as planned,

51
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,000
but this has the potential to create chaos

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,280
on a level we have never before known.

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,130
‐ It's hard to believe
it's been almost 100 years.

54
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,580
If nothing is done, the Earth Sphere

55
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,470
will not be able to continue.

56
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,520
Those who can correct the
flaws of the Universal Century

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,070
are beginning to emerge.

58
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,920
I pray that we will soon find one

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,910
who can be entrusted
to carry Laplace's Box.

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,780
‐ Yes, sir.

61
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:33,715
‐ Cardeas.

62
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,770
Can you forgive me?

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,480
‐ What we're about to do could lead

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,850
to the destruction of the world.

65
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,880
If anyone were able to
give you forgiveness,

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,651
it would have to be me.

67
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:55,234
[pensive orchestral music]

68
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,147
[pensive orchestral music builds]

69
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,020
[bright beeping]

70
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,490
‐ [Man] Disperse Minovsky
Particles at combat density now!

71
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,520
‐ [Man] Enemy ship
appears to be Clop class.

72
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,220
Thermal energy detected.

73
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,499
‐ [Man] Evasive maneuvers!

74
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,659
[muffled blasting]

75
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,742
[electrical zapping]

76
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,271
[electrical zapping]

77
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,700
‐ [Man] What's taking so
long with the bulkheads?

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,260
‐ Intense heat sources
emitted from the ship.

79
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,720
Appears to be two mobile suits.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,300
Correction, make that three suits!

81
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,120
Approaching at high speed.

82
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,140
‐ Send Marida out.

83
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,614
Ignore the mothership.

84
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:55,480
The Garencieres can shake it off.

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,313
‐ Roger that.

86
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,720
Target has been acquired.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,410
That's a high‐speed Jegan,

88
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,260
possibly a special forces version.

89
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,170
‐ [Captain] That means
this was no coincidence.

90
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,310
We hit the debris cluster in 10 minutes.

91
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,010
Take care of those
Jegans and get back here.

92
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,990
‐ [Marida] That's an affirmative, Master.

93
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,780
‐ And stop calling me Master.

94
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,470
‐ Marida Cruz, Kshatriya, launch!

95
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,025
[thrusters blasting]

96
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,275
[dramatic tense music]

00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:40,382
[beeping]

98
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,305
No way you're following our ship.

99
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,138
Funnels!

100
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,388
[dramatic tense music]

00:05:56,776 --> 00:06:01,776
[dramatic tense music builds]

[electrical zapping]

108
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,481
‐ [Robotic Voice] Damn the Sleeves!

109
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,731
‐ [Marida] Mission
complete, returning to ship.

110
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,570
‐ Therefore, it was
the Battle of A Baoa Qu

111
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,950
which brought an end to the
One Year War 17 years ago,

112
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,020
one year before you were born.

113
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,080
Once the hostilities ceased,
over half of the human race

114
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,830
had been wiped out.

115
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,970
The war was started by
the Principality of Zeon

116
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,150
in the name of independence
for the space immigrants.

117
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,340
And even though the war's officially over,

118
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,640
groups claiming to be the remnants of Zeon

119
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,020
have started their own wars.

120
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,910
They claim to desire
autonomy for the Spacenoids,

121
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,400
but at their heart, you will
still find the same ideas

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,280
of the inherent superiority
of the chosen elite

123
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,270
found in the philosophy of Gihren Zabi.

124
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,050
The concept of Zeonism,
proposed by Zeon Deikun,

125
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,050
the so‐called Newtype ideology,
was a dangerous belief

126
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,803
that ultimately produced
these rebellious elements.

127
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:35,824

00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:37,930
You there!

130
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,960
You'd best give me your full attention.

131
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,300
You believe you can get a
job without an education?

132
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,920
But Anaheim won't even hire you

133
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
for a factory worker position

134
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,730
if you don't hold some kind of diploma!

135
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,360
Don't believe everything
you hear about that 100%

136
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,140
job placement rate.

137
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,770
‐ Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Bancroft.

138
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,984
It's the shuttle again.

139
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,843
[students chattering]

140
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:00,843
[sighs]

141
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,210
‐ [Marco] Don't you think it's time

142
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,650
they upgraded the shuttles?

143
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,530
‐ [Takuya] The chairman's such a tightwad.

144
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,030
He thinks that the decommissioned

145
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,400
Anaheim ones are enough.

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,420
‐ [Micott] So are we staying
here tonight, or what?

147
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,290
I didn't bring a change of clothes.

148
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,450
‐ [Ester] Yeah, me neither.

149
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,690
‐ So that means tomorrow,
we're gonna miss the field trip

150
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,720
to the Snail.

151
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,650
‐ No way!

152
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,630
I can't spend two days here

153
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,440
listening to Bancroft's special lectures!

154
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,330
It'll put me in a coma!

155
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,720
‐ I bet I could teach all the
history up to Char's Rebellion

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
in under two minutes, right, Banagher?

157
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,180
Hey, look up there, it's a Zaku!

158
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,640
Dammit, Bancroft, why didn't you tell us

159
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,740
there was something so cool here?

160
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,573
‐ [Ester] What is it?

161
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,100
What's so cool about it?

162
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,110
‐ It's only the granddaddy
of all mobile suits!

163
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,943
[Ester grunts]

164
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:49,980
Hey, wait a sec, we gotta check it out!

165
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,870
‐ [Marco] No, we don't.

166
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,700
‐ [Ester] The wars ended a long time ago.

167
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,340
What are those things good for?

168
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,650
‐ [Denis] Takuya, I'm pretty
sure you can't take pictures.

169
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,890
‐ If you'd listen to me, we
coulda had so much fun, but no.

170
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,570
‐ Hey, Banagher.

171
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,550
Do you realize you look out
into the distance a lot?

172
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,900
‐ I do?

173
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,140
‐ Yeah, like just now.

174
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,060
‐ I'm not really looking
at anything when I do that.

175
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,220
It's hard to explain.

176
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,040
I guess I'm wondering where‐‐

177
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,430
‐ [Micott] Where your father is?

178
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,250
‐ [Banagher] No, where I am.

179
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,710
‐ [Micott] Oh, sorry.

180
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,690
‐ It feels like no matter what I'm doing,

181
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,820
I don't actually feel like I'm there.

182
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,810
‐ I know what you mean!

183
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,620
It's like you can't put your finger on it,

184
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,550
but everything feels off, right?

185
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,243
‐ Yeah.

186
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,430
‐ I sometimes wonder if that feeling's

187
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,550
gonna keep growing stronger.

188
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,641
I think the only people
who don't think that way...

189
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:55,641
[sharp ringing]
[soft pensive music]

190
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,340
Hey, are you listening to me?

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,699
‐ A mobile suit.

192
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:11,199
[Micott grunts]

193
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:18,099
[soft tense music]
[sharp whistling]

194
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,996
[panting]

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,291
‐ Increase velocity.

196
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,598
‐ Right.

197
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:33,520
[thrusters blasting]

198
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,210
‐ Fly like you're going
straight into that debris field.

199
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,899
[man panting]

200
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,203
[beeping]

201
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,090
Keep going.

202
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,611
‐ [groans] Please, sir, I can't!

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,469
‐ Breakdown, 0‐6‐0.

204
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,969
[tense music]

205
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,793
[sighs]

206
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,647
I'm most impressed.

207
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:04,480
‐ Thank you.

208
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,790
‐ With the machine.

209
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,200
At ease.

210
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,640
‐ [Gael] RX‐0, final phase, all clear.

211
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,560
Psycho frame g‐force
within expected parameters.

212
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,060
Pilot's life signs stable.

213
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,800
‐ We're heading back now, Gael.

214
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,170
‐ [Man] I'm sorry, sir.

215
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,320
‐ What's the matter?

216
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,400
‐ There were still some people
at the Anaheim Electronics

217
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,730
Industrial College training facility.

218
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,960
‐ [Commander] I thought we
checked the class schedule.

219
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
‐ [Man] We did, sir, but it seems

220
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,960
the transit shuttle broke down.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,210
‐ I see.

222
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,250
Well, even if someone
did happen to notice it,

223
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,570
we were moving so fast,
they couldn't have caught

224
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,800
more than a glimpse.

225
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,150
‐ I was able to get hold of
a staff officer on Luna II.

226
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,690
They confirmed a Londo Bell
ship ran into some Sleeves

227
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,940
and tried to pursue them.

228
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,000
‐ So there was a leak.

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,590
Did they engage in battle?

230
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,423
‐ Yes, sir.

231
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:00,210
Not only did they lose three mobile suits,

232
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,450
but they let them get away.

233
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,790
‐ Is there anything else?

234
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,640
‐ I tried Londenion, but their commander

235
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,040
isn't very forthcoming.

236
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,090
‐ That would be Bright Noa, I believe.

237
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,630
Try the supply fleets then.

238
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,830
That'll tell us how the
fleet itself is moving.

239
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,663
‐ [Man] Yes, sir.

240
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,290
‐ All right, everyone, listen up.

241
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,630
All operational testing of
the RX‐0 is now finished.

242
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,360
The testing OS must now be deleted.

243
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,520
Seal the NT‐D and boot up
the La+ Program immediately.

244
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,459
[staff applauding]

245
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,604

[sighs]

247
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,680
Forgive, huh?

248
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:04,361
[soft whirring]

249
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,320
‐ Roger that, entering gate number five.

250
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
So what are we gonna do with this

251
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,490
Laplace's Box thing anyway?

252
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,710
‐ If they really have it,
we'll bring it back home.

253
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,130
If it's a trap, we'll fight our way out.

254
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,568
[soft whirring]

255
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:40,307

[gasps]

264
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,350
‐ Man, I don't think I
can deal with any more

265
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,590
of this weightlessness.

266
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,060
Let me skip the Snail
field trip, it's too much!

267
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,430
‐ [Man] What's too much
is all the partying

268
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,263
you did last night.

269
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:03,820
‐ Looking at the
Construction Unit is boring!

270
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,980
‐ [Ester] Are you kidding?

271
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,690
People don't usually get
to look inside that thing!

272
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,733
[gasps softly]

273
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,566
‐ Banagher!

274
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:14,399
‐ [Takuya] Don't bother, Micott.

275
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,900
‐ [Haro] Banagher go to bathroom?

276
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,400
‐ I gotta check something out.

277
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,937
[wind blowing]

278
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,294
‐ [Audrey] [inhales] I can't die, not now!

279
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:28,794
[tense music]

280
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,690
‐ Hey, what are you doing?

281
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,210
‐ Gotta borrow this for a sec.

282
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,043
‐ You can't do that!

283
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:41,930
Get the hell back here! [groaning]

284
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,180
Get back here!

285
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,716
‐ This handles different than in a vacuum.

286

[soft tense music]

287
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,380
There you are, but it's
almost daybreak, not good!

[groaning]

289
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,123
‐ [Audrey] I have to hold on!

290
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:02,913
I still need to...

291

[beeping]

296
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,831

00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,331
[tense music]

298
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,348
Brace yourself!

299
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,553
‐ [Haro] Danger, danger!

300

[smoke hissing]

301
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,920
Banagher, wake up.

302
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,170
Banagher, wake up.

306
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,570
‐ [Audrey] Who are you?

307
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,520
‐ What's your problem?

308
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,114
‐ [Haro] Banagher, are you okay?

309
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:29,947
Banagher!

310
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:31,200
‐ You're from this colony?

311
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,560
[grunts]

312
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm in a hurry.

313
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,900
Will you be able to help me get to

314
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,960
the Colony Builder's entrance?

315
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,400
‐ You mean the Snail?

316
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,060
‐ [Audrey] Can we get there in this thing?

317
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,400
‐ It's outta gas, and the battery's shot.

318
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,130
‐ I don't have much time, help me!

319
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,900
There's someone I must speak with,

320
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,480
but if I don't get there in time,

321
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,490
I'm afraid something terrible will happen!

322
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,180
We must act immediately, so please!

323
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,400
‐ Stop something?

324
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,544
What is it?

325
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:57,377
‐ A war.

326
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,017
[tense pounding]

327
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,743
‐ Hey, wait!

328
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,580
You can't do it alone!

329
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:18,610
[mechanical whirring]

330
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,230
Who's this person you need to talk to?

331
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,920
The Snail, that's what everyone
calls the Colony Builder,

332
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,390
but all it is is a factory.

333
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,320
Although it's just a rumor, supposedly,

334
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,870
there's a Vist Foundation
mansion at the end of it.

335
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,220
‐ Have you been there?

336
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,540
‐ No, I've never seen it,

337
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,650
but one of their higher‐ups
is the chairman of my school.

338
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,950
‐ [Train Announcer]
Attention all passengers,

339
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,000
this is a security announcement.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,260
The authorities have just
issued a security alert.

341
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,900
This train will be stopped
temporarily at this station

342
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,840
until the security alert has been lifted.

343
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,100
‐ Seems like this keeps happening.

344
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,670
‐ Well, the government has to
be extra cautious these days.

345
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,850
‐ [Marco] Why don't we get off here?

346
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,541
‐ [Ester] We can't do that, Marco!

347
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,541
[people chattering]

348
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,223
‐ We should go.

349
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,840
‐ [Captain] So you're thinking
she was in that Petite MS?

350
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,350
‐ Makes sense, given the fact

351
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,690
that she's nowhere to be found.

352
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,230
‐ [Captain] We're going
to be in a lot of trouble

353
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,700
if the Federation saw her,

354
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,550
but we have to see how
the foundation reacts

355
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,710
before we can know that.

356
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,580
‐ My apologies, sir.

357
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,090
It's my fault for not noticing

358
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,640
that she stowed away on our ship.

359
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,010
‐ No, it's not.

360
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,330
I'm the captain of this ship,
so I'm the one to blame.

361
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,490
Fortunately, we know where she's going.

362
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,000
Get her back before she has a chance

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,950
to make contact with Cardeas Vist,

364
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,650
and try to stay under the radar.

365
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,190
‐ [Audrey] So, that's a Construction Unit?

366
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,050
‐ Yeah, it's a factory unit
that builds foundation blocks

367
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,883
for the colony.

368
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,040
This whole place is
still under construction.

369
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,280
Why aren't you eating?

370
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,050
You got to be starving!

371
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,290
Let's keep on the move.

372
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,270
‐ You mean we're going to eat and walk?

373
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,380
[distant ringing]

374
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,820
‐ Hey, they're about to
begin a factory tour.

375
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,420
We can blend in with the crowd.

376
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,620
We'll figure out the
rest once we're inside.

377
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,583
‐ Marida!

378
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,400
‐ Let's go back.

379
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,190
You have your position to consider.

380
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,250
‐ If you understood my position,
you'd know I can't do that!

381
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,900
‐ I know what you're trying is futile.

382
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,480
‐ [Audrey] We can't handle
Laplace's Box right now,

383
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,660
whatever it is.

384
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,360
It will simply be used by Full Frontal

385
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,080
to start a meaningless war,

386
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,620
which will bring nothing
but more suffering.

387
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,720
You understand that, don't you?

388
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,140
‐ I don't.

389
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,340
I understand that I have orders to follow.

390
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,173
‐ That's a lie!

391
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,050
You weren't given your powers for this.

392
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,480
You know very well that‐‐

393
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,722
‐ I'm sorry.

394
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:18,203

397
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,373
‐ Give me your hand.

00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:36,880
‐ Why did‐‐
‐ My name.

407
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
Sorry, I was only gonna say
I never told you my name.

408
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,740
‐ It's Banagher.

409
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,280
Your pet called out your
name after we crashed.

410
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,620
‐ Banagher, go, Banagher, go, Banagher!

411
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,870
‐ Yeah, so I'm Banagher Links.

412
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,710
‐ And I'm,

413
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,900
my name's Audrey, Audrey Burne.

414
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,510
‐ Audrey!

415
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,820
This is Haro.

416
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,540
It's a replica of a robot mascot

417
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,350
built by an ace pilot back during the war.

418
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,590
It was the coolest thing
ever when we were kids.

419
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,760
‐ [Audrey] I wouldn't
know what most kids liked.

420
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,090
‐ [Banagher] What do you mean?

421
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,710
‐ [Audrey] Well, when I grew
up, we were always on the move.

422
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,280
I was brought up like a nomad.

423
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,851
‐ Yeah, that sounds a lot like me.

424

[soft pensive music]

425
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,370
‐ [Takuya] Man, look at those rails!

426
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,910
‐ [Ester] They go up so high!

427
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,660
‐ [Marco] Whoa, check out that framework!

428
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,880
‐ Come on, Micott, take
a look, it's really cool!

429
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,130
‐ Yeah, right down there!

430
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,520
‐ I guess Banagher never showed, huh?

431
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,470
‐ That Petite MS that
crashed on our school campus,

432
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,930
I hope that wasn't him.

433
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,450
‐ It didn't crash, that
was a forced landing.

434
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,710
And we don't know why he did it,

435
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,010
so we shouldn't be
spreading rumors about him.

436
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,410
If he gets kicked out of school,

437
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,930
he's gonna be living on the streets!

438
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,294
It's not like he has a home to go back to!

00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,580
Who's that girl he's with?

442
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,700
‐ [Banagher] Those
people who are after you,

443
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,240
what's up with them?

444
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,260
‐ [Audrey] I ran away, they're
supposed to bring me back.

445
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,480
They're not trying to hurt us.

446
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,120
‐ [Banagher] You some
kind of political activist

447
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,953
or something?

448
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,990
You know, one of those anti‐Federation,

449
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,340
the ones seeking independence

450
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,390
for the Spacenoids, or whatever?

451
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,940
‐ [Audrey] Kinda, only scarier.

452
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,762
‐ You said you wanted to
prevent a war, didn't you?

[warm pensive music]

The walls of the colony grows,

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,190
more and more foundation blocks are added.

456
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,800
‐ Amazing!

457
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,935
The world itself is growing.

[warm pensive music]

459
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,940
‐ [Man With Mustache] Sir,
we picked something up

460
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,720
on lift two's surveillance camera.

461
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,700
‐ [gasps] What is she doing there?

462
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,960
‐ I don't know, sir.

463
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
I received a report that
earlier this morning,

464
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,490
someone snuck into the service route

465
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,770
to the artificial sun, but I
never would have imagined‐‐

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,630
‐ Have you heard anything
from the Sleeves?

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,000
‐ [Man With Mustache] No, sir.

468
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,830
‐ So she's acting on her own.

469
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,000
‐ This may interfere
with the Box's delivery.

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,510
I still believe that as
head of the Vist Foundation,

471
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,620
your meeting with the Sleeves
in person is ill‐advised.

472
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,390
‐ And what do you have
on this boy she's with?

473
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,520
‐ Ah, yes, sir, he was with her.

474
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,002
He looks a little young to be a bodyguard.

I've seen this before.

00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,060
‐ Interested in that?

492
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,800
The Lady and the Unicorn.

493
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,900
It's a tapestry believed
to have been created

494
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,290
in France before the Middle
Era, and it's no replica.

495
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,540
My predecessor went through
a great deal of trouble

496
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,070
to acquire it prior to the One Year War.

497
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,730
I'm head of the family,
Cardeas Vist, this is my home.

498
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,000
‐ I must apologize for
coming into your home

499
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,810
without permission, my name is‐‐

500
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,750
‐ I'm aware of who you are.

501
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,470
I think it would be best for everyone

502
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,610
if you didn't mention your name.

503
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,530
‐ Then we'll skip the formality.

504
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,390
As long as you understand my position,

505
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,000
that's all that really matters.

506
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,040
I've come here to ask you to
rethink this course of action.

507
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,880
I'm referring to Laplace's Box

508
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,970
and your plan to hand it over to us.

509
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,620
‐ I think you had better leave.

510
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,360
It's too dangerous, we
shouldn't be talking

511
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,020
under these circumstances.

512
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,100
‐ Zinnerman is a rational man.

513
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,610
He wouldn't cause trouble unnecessarily.

514
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,110
‐ Would you consider your
protection unnecessary?

515
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,480
‐ Tell me, why are you doing this?

516
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,450
I've heard that Laplace's
Box has guaranteed

517
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,890
the prosperity of the Vist
Foundation for decades.

518
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,140
Why give it to us now?

519
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,540
‐ Excuse me, you've been asked to leave.

520
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,040
‐ There are people after her!

521
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,480
I won't leave her alone!

522
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,090
‐ Do you even have the
slightest idea who they are

523
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,410
or what they want with
her, for that matter?

524
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,240
‐ I don't, I don't, but
they are scary people!

525
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,650
‐ Scary?

526
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,240
‐ [Banagher] Well, that's
just how they felt.

527
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,050
‐ That's something a Newtype would say.

528
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,760
‐ [Banagher] She said they were scary.

529
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,590
‐ [Cardeas] You are
putting your future at risk

530
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,940
by staying here.

531
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,760
This is not what your father intended

532
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,620
when he sent you to Anaheim
Electronics Industrial College.

533
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
‐ How do you‐‐

534
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,480
‐ I'm the chairman of your school.

535
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,400
As such, I can find
out who my students are

536
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,080
and can find out anything I need to know,

537
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,940
or expel them as I see fit.

538
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,250
‐ Go home, Banagher.

539
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,970
I appreciate all you've
done for me thus far.

540
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,890
I can take it from here.

541
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,230
‐ But Audrey, I can still help!

542
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,490
You came here to prevent
the war, didn't you?

543
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,410
And doesn't he have the power
to do something about that?

544
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,410
Hearing you talk about
the war is so different

545
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,810
from hearing my professors
talk about it, more grave.

546
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,491
You've made me see how bad it
would be, so please, let me‐‐

547
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:08,408
‐ Banagher.

548
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,480
‐ My heart was pounding
when I saw you fall

549
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,990
from the sky this morning.

550
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,870
Everything that felt off in
my life just slid into place.

551
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,100
For the first time in my life,

552
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,230
I knew what I was supposed to do.

553
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,600
I don't care who you are!

554
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,870
Just say that you need me
and I'll, just tell me.

555
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,010
‐ I don't need you.

556
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,310
Now, go.

557
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,726
The best thing you can
do is forget about me.

558
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:35,643
[soft tense music]

559
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,200
‐ [Cardeas] You made the right decision.

560
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
I've changed the location of the exchange

561
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,300
with your comrades.

562
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,630
Once the time seems right,
you'll be reunited with them.

563
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,240
‐ I urge you to rethink the consequences

564
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,450
of what you're about to do.

565
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,900
‐ I understand your concern
about this, you're not wrong.

566
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,820
I'm aware that Full
Frontal is being called

567
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,660
the second coming of Char,
and not to be taken lightly.

568
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:09,490
‐ Then why are you‐‐

569
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,140
‐ [Cardeas] Because it's not that simple.

570
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,070
Even if given the key, it will
still take someone qualified

571
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,910
to open Laplace's Box.

572
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:20,180
[cheering]

573
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,490
‐ [Audrey] The key to the box?

574
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,770
‐ We have taken steps to create something

575
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,220
that will ensure that this
is no easy horse to break.

576
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,940
‐ [Captain] All right, return to the ship.

577
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,460
We've just received a
message from the Foundation.

578
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,540
They want to move the
meeting from the Central Port

579
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,910
to the Colony Builder.

580
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,960
‐ So what did they say about her?

581
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
‐ They're feigning ignorance.

582
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,730
I can't tell what they're up to,

583
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,810
but we'll keep a poker face on for now.

584
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,680
You just head back to the ship.

585
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,040
I need you to be ready for anything.

586
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,963
[upbeat music]

587
00:31:58,829 --> 00:31:59,662
[static buzzing]

588
00:31:59,662 --> 00:32:00,800
‐ Huh, what's that?

589
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,190
‐ The head of the Vist
Foundation in person.

590
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,300
I'm honored.

591
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,360
‐ We're entrusting you with
the fate of the Foundation.

592
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,040
I couldn't leave this to anyone else.

593
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,290
This way, come.

594
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,461
‐ [groans angrily] You piece of crap!

595
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:30,461
[sighs]

596
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,830
Londo Bell?

597
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,181
What are they doing here?

598
00:32:38,181 --> 00:32:41,098
[soft tense music]

599
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,603
‐ Enemy?

600
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,590
‐ A key?

601
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,830
What's this?

602
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,940
So it's not the box
itself you're giving us,

603
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,590
but rather, its key?

604
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,200
‐ Unsatisfied?

605
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,510
‐ Not unsatisfied, just confused.

606
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,720
We don't even know what
the box is or what it does.

607
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,870
Of course, nobody does, do they?

608
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,050
But we do know that opening Laplace's Box

609
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,340
would mean overthrowing the Federation,

610
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,730
and that your Vist
Foundation's wealth and glory

611
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,420
come from your secret possession of it.

612
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,810
We also know that your
reputation as a charity

613
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,940
that transports works
of art to the colonies

614
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,390
is nothing more than a front.

615
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,250
The truth, however‐‐

616
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,980
‐ Your leaders acknowledge the value

617
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,920
of what we're offering you here today,

618
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,430
which is why they sent a man
of your skill to receive it.

619
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,150
‐ What with our situation
being what it is,

620
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,370
we can't afford not to grab at any carrot

621
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,820
that's dangled before us.

622
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,420
And if it turns out that
carrot has been poisoned,

623
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,540
I guess my superiors will be disappointed.

624
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,720
‐ Tell me, do you believe in the existence

625
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,060
of Newtypes, Captain?

626
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,140
‐ Spend enough time on the battlefield,

627
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,520
and you'll encounter a sort of power

628
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,590
that can't be explained away easily.

629
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,040
‐ Power, a word that someone
with personal experience

630
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,390
might have chosen.

631
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,800
As humanity expands into space,

632
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,160
all of our latent abilities will blossom

633
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,730
in order to adapt to that great void.

634
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,450
We will then be able to understand

635
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,390
and accept one another
without misconceptions.

636
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,970
That's the Newtype theory
once proposed by Zeon Deikun.

637
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,100
It spoke of the reformation
of all of humanity,

638
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,520
of infinite possibilities,
of power itself.

‐ [Cardeas] Since its
victory in the One Year War,

646
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,690
the Federation has lived in
fear of this unseen power.

647
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,120
The power that screams [speaks in French]

648
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,590
at the privileged class
that lives on Eearth,

649
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,260
the power that calls all the
abandoned Spacenoids to awaken.

650
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,028
‐ What?

00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:55,028
[loud blasting]
[dramatic tense music]

[yelling]
[gun firing]

653
00:34:57,787 --> 00:34:59,070
‐ [Cardeas] A power that could overthrow

654
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,940
the control of the Federation government,

655
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,400
whose rule has lasted nearly 100 years.

656
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,340
‐ Damn you to hell!

657
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,279
Space belongs to the Spacenoids!

658
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:08,779
[tense music]

659
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,225

[groaning]

661
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,350
‐ [Cardeas] The Federation has
been absorbed for decades now

662
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,990
in a battle against this invisible power.

663
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,960
‐ Damn you all,

664
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:30,455
all of you dogs whose souls
are still bound to the Earth!

665
00:35:30,455 --> 00:35:33,705
[dramatic tense music]

666
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,786
Long live Neo Zeon!

667
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:42,185
[dramatic tense music]

668
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,366
[loud blasting]

669
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,119
[pounding blast]

670
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,940
‐ Marida, what in the hell was that?

671
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,000
‐ Gilboa, have you heard from the captain?

672
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,910
‐ [Gilboa] We lost the connection.

673
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,210
The Minovsky Particles are getting denser.

674
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,991
‐ Should we engage inside the colony?

675
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:10,450
‐ [Gilboa] The enemy has
surrounded the colony.

676
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,070
Our only option is to
cut straight through,

677
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,820
find the captain, and
get the hell outta here.

678
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,830
‐ [Marida] Roger that.

679
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,360
‐ While it's true that
government research facilities

680
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,050
were created, they were like
laboratories of mad scientists

681
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,540
who deviated from the original ideologies,

682
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,770
and rather, chose to focus
on the military applications

683
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,603
of the Newtypes.

684
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,550
Then came the civil conflict
known as the Gryps War,

685
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,850
and after that, both Neo Zeon wars.

686
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,680
The ensuing oppression led to
the rise of military factions,

687
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,850
and the Federation
suffered greatly for this.

688
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,430
However, they did have a strong ally

689
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,790
that ultimately secured their victory.

690
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:58,040
Do you know what it is I'm referring to?

691
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,640
‐ [Captain] Would that be time?

692
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,000
‐ [Cardeas] Indeed.

693
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,990
The public grew impatient

694
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,700
and sought results from these Newtypes,

695
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,090
which, at this point, still
had no specific definition,

696
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,650
only potential.

697
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,740
The term Newtype eventually
came to be synonymous

698
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,140
with ace pilot, a new
definition completely removed

699
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,090
from Zeon Deikun's concept

700
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,760
of understanding without misconceptions.

701
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:25,107
‐ Hey, Tom, what do you think that is?

702
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:26,467
‐ Back there, what's that?

703
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:29,787
[soft tense music]

704
00:37:29,787 --> 00:37:33,220
‐ Laplace's Box holds the
power to change our future,

705
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,270
or, more to the point, it has the power

706
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,930
to restore the future
that was meant to be.

707
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,460
However, not all men are
able to wield this power.

708
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,290
But be warned, if the
power were to be misused,

709
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,190
it could destroy the world.

710
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,020
‐ So you're giving us this
key as a test to start.

711
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,120
‐ If, for instance,
you're small‐minded enough

712
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,400
that you focus only on a single thing,

713
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,390
the box will never reveal
its contents to you.

714
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,680
‐ That one thing being?

715
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,420
‐ The revival of Zeon.

[people screaming]

723
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,110
‐ It's Londo Bell, combat
has already broken out

724
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,640
inside the colony, sir.

725
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,710
‐ Has the military informed us?

726
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,290
‐ Are you saying we've
been caught in a trap?

727
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,050
That's what it sounds like.

728
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,910
‐ Not at all.

729
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,770
In fact, I'd say you were followed here,

730
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,990
but neither of us could prove that.

731
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,330
‐ We'll be taking her back now.

732
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,700
‐ It was always my intention to return her

733
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,970
when the time was right.

734
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,461
She's safe in my mansion.

[distant blasting]

man to trust another now.

737
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,500
It's an unfortunate state of things.

738
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,400

‐ Guys, isn't that around
where the school is?

00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,260
‐ This is war.

761
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,100
This is the beginning of a war.

762
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,017
‐ A war.

[dramatic pensive music]

‐ Sir.

772
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,690
‐ It's a shame.

773
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,570
The Federation will
break a 100‐year alliance

774
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,600
to take everything away from us.

775
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,620
Then again, we were the ones who sought

776
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,550
to jeopardize it first.

777
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,550

Hey, Micott, you're not hurt, are you?

‐ [Micott] Where are they? [sobbing]

798
00:43:30,038 --> 00:43:31,850
‐ Takuya, take care of Micott.

‐ Where are you going?

800

‐ There's someone I have to rescue.

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,350
Did you recognize that mobile suit

802
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,850
that just tore through here?

803
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,210
‐ It looked like a Zeta‐type
Transformable Suit.

804
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,670
I think it's from the Federation.

805
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,470
‐ Then its mothership
should be at the Snail.

806

You have to get there, it can protect you!

Please don't leave me!
