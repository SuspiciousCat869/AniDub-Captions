1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,041
[NARRATOR] In the past,
gamblers have been limited

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,541
to horse, bike, boat,
and car races.

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,750
But now there's a new form
of legalized gambling

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,958
sweeping the nation.

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,041
It's called Keijo!

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,041
Players compete to be
the last girl standing

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,541
atop a floating platform
called a "Land."

8
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,583
The kicker? They can only
use their boobs and butts!

9
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,125
The question is:
Who will rule the land?

10
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,041
Will it be the 18-year-old
Nozomi Kaminashi?

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,416
She's one of the
many young ladies

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,375
whose search for fame
and fortune has lead them

13
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,333
to the world of Keijo!

14
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,708
And this is the story of their
journey to becoming champions!

15
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,875
[HITOMI]
Listen up, ladies.

16
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,500
Keijo begins and ends
with the buttocks!

17
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,416
It's the foundation of the
sport. So let's tone it!

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,541
Give me 100 figure-eights!
On the double!

19
00:00:53,625 --> 00:01:00,500
[GIRLS]
One! Two! Three! Four!

20
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:06,333
Five! Six! Seven!
Eight! Nine! Ten!

21
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,833
[HITOMI]
Toyoguchi! Aoba! Try to keep up!

22
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,458
'Kay, sorry!

23
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,291
Now I want you to give me three
sets of 100-meter butt-walks!

24
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,041
Man, this is harder
than I thought!

25
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,583
[HITOMI] Pick up the pace!
Ten laps to go!

26
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,916
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,083
[HITOMI] Toyoguchi, Aoba!
You're falling behind!

28
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,583
[NON]
I'm so sorry!

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,833
[HITOMI] Okay, that wraps
up morning practice.

30
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,000
You better get used to it.

31
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,875
As long as you're in
the regular class,

32
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,166
you'll be doing this every
morning for the next year.

33
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,666
[GIRLS groan]

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,625
[HITOMI] Your training at
Setouchi isn't gonna be easy.

35
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,250
The reality of the situation
is one in five students

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,875
will drop out before graduation.

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,916
You're stuck with me.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,666
That is, unless you
work hard enough

39
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,625
to get bumped to elite class.

40
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,125
We'll be grading you not only
on your physical abilities,

41
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,166
but your overall behavior and
general attitude as well.

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,416
So keep that in mind.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,166
Stay strong and train
hard every day!

44
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,791
[NOZOMI] I can't get over
this place! It's amazin'!

45
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,291
If you ask for extra eggs
and rice, they'll give it to ya!

46
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,833
[NON] I asked for a larger
serving and I sure got it!

47
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,541
[SAYAKA]
Yes, I can see that.

48
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,500
[NOZOMI] Oh, to think,
I can start every morning

49
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,416
by eatin' as much rice
with egg as I want!

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,875
Talk about luxurious!

51
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,041
I dunno about you guys but...

52
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,625
...I could get used to this!

53
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,041
[YUKO]
Gimme a break.

54
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,791
If you think this is impressive,
then you should see what

55
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,750
they serve the elite
class for breakfast.

56
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,291
It looks outta this world!

57
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,500
[NOZOMI]
Huh?

58
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,083
Ah! You gotta be kiddin'!

59
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,875
[SAYAKA]
Why'd you have to drag me along?

60
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,583
[NOZOMI] It's not fair,
they get a full-out feast!

61
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,916
[NOZOMI gasps]

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,291
[chuckles]

63
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,291
[NOZOMI] They can have
ice cream for breakfast?

64
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,916
Ohh!

65
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,833
[SAYAKA] It's only the first
day and I'm already jealous.

66
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,625
[NOZOMI] Oh! The elite class
is so friggin' lucky!

67
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,541
[HITOMI]
Ten 200-meter sprints!

68
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,833
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

69
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,250
[HITOMI] C'mon, Toyoguchi
and Aoba! Move it!

70
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,541
Give me 20 pull-ups!

71
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:57,583
[GIRLS]
Five. Six. Seven.

72
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,666
[yelps]

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,375
[HITOMI]
Fifty sit-ups!

74
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,500
[GIRLS]
Twenty-one. Twenty-two.

75
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,166
[HITOMI]
Now, 100 squats!

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,666
[GIRLS]
Ninety-six. Ninety-seven.

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,041
Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine.

78
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,291
One hundred!

79
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,875
[NOZOMI groans]

80
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,000
[NOZOMI]
I'm so over physical trainin'.

81
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,875
[MIKU] In the world of
Keijo we have a saying:

82
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,208
"Know not thy rump,
never shalt thou triumph"!

83
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,708
It's not enough to train
your bodacious behind.

84
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,125
If you want to excel at Keijo,

85
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,333
you have to understand
the science behind it.

86
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,125
A science called "Asstronomy."

87
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,291
Breasts and buttocks are very
intricate subjects of study.

88
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,041
Has anyone ever
noticed Westerners

89
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,375
tend to have higher
and firmer derrieres?

90
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,083
Well, there's a reason for that.

91
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,458
It's because their pelvis
is tilted differently.

92
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,791
Most Japanese pelvises
tilt backwards,

93
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,583
however, Westerners'
have a forward tilt

94
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,875
that causes their
tushies to sit higher.

95
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,125
Bet you never knew
that, did you?

96
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,791
Learning the mechanics behind it
all will help you train in a way

97
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,708
that best suits
your body's needs.

98
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,750
[NOZOMI]
They're already on the Land!

99
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,583
Aw, man, the elite
class is so lucky!

100
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,208
Sit back down!

101
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,916
[MIKU] ...and learn to
attack with precision.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,166
Like this!

103
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,791
Did you get all of that,
Miss Kaminashi?

104
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,666
[NOZOMI groans]

105
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,500
Yes, ma'am.

106
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,958
[HITOMI] You've got two
more laps. Pick up the pace!

107
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,041
I don't think I've
got two more in me!

108
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
Today's training was super hard!

109
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,916
You can say that again.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,750
You don't seem
too phased, Miyata.

111
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,666
I didn't think it
was all that bad.

112
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,500
But we're gonna train
this hard every day

113
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,958
for the rest of the year.

114
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,666
I'm well aware and I'm ready
for it. I want to go pro.

115
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, me too!

116
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,500
I should prob'ly start
paying more attention

117
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,083
to the pro players.

118
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,166
There was a chick I saw
at Nishinomiya Stadium

119
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,916
who attacked with her butt and--

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,416
Bam! She won!

121
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,625
I wish I could remember
that player's name.

122
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,625
It's a weird one.
Somethin', somethin' Kyoto.

123
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,250
If she was using big,
flashy moves,

124
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,166
maybe it was Shinonome!

125
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,458
Nah, I know that's not it.

126
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,125
Aw, c'mon, brain, she was
the somethin' Lady of Kyoto.

127
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,625
[NON]
Uhh... Shirokuma?

128
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,875
[NOZOMI]
Yeah, that's it! Shirokuma!

129
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,083
Ya heard of her, Aoba?

130
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,458
She's awesome!
The Shirokuma Lady of Kyoto!

131
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,041
[HITOMI]
Training begins now!

132
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,583
[NOZOMI yelps]

133
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,250
[HITOMI]
Now sprint!

134
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,541

Yes, ma'am!

135
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,458

Begin!

[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

137
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,208
[NOZOMI]
This sucks.

138
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,708
I wanna practice on the Land.

139
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,666
C'mon, let's go.
We're going to be late.

140
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,208
I don't wanna.
You can't make me!

141
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,166
[NOZOMI sighs]

142
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,958
I think we should get
to practice on the Land

143
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,958
at least once, don't you?

144
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,208
[HITOMI]
Fifty-meter dash!

145
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,541
Look at me! Number one!

146
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,583
Well, yeah! Only because
your tire fell off!

147
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,916
It did?

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,416
Okay, Miyata. You're the
ref so what's your call?

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,916
She's disqualified. Execute her.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,375
[NON screams]

151
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,541
[HITOMI] That's enough, room
309! Quit messin' around!

152
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,750
Keijo-Style Tire
Rolling. Let's go!

[yells

154
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,500
[GIRL E]
Are you blind?

155
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,000
[MIKU] Looks like we've
got a strong group

156
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,291
of newbies this year, don't we?

157
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,541
[HITOMI] Yeah, I think they're
ready for the next step.

158
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,416
Gather round!

159
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,416
Today you'll be learning a
technique called the hip toss.

160
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,083
It's a type of training that
utilizes a beach ball.

161
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,666
Your roommates
will form a circle

162
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,041
and you must toss the ball to
each other without dropping it.

163
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,250
What makes it challenging is
you can only use your butt.

164
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,375
No breasts.

165
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,083
Your goal's 30 tosses.

166
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,375
The team who comes in
last will get a penalty,

167
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,500
so do your best!

168
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,750
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

169
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,166
Whoa! Cool!

170
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,958
We're finally gettin' into
some real Keijo trainin'!

171
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,250
[NOZOMI]
Hey, Aoba, you comin'?

172
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,458
Gals, I say we forget about 30

173
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,000
and shoot for a hundred
consecutive tosses!

174
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,875
Okay, here goes.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,583
Got it!

176
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,958
I'm headed that way!

177
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,166
[BOTH gasp]

178
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,333
Sorry about that!

179
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, no, that was my fault.

180
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,833
Well, let's give it
another try, you guys.

181
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,458
[BOTH gasp]

182
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,833
Oh, man, this ain't
workin' at all.

183
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,083
Hey, keep in mind which
way the wind is blowin'!

184
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,375
--[SAYAKA] Roger!
--[NON] Will do!

185
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,250
Alrighty, heads up!

186
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,083
[NOZOMI]
I got it!

187
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,125
Crap, the wind changed
direction again!

188
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,708
There's no stoppin' me!

189
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,791
[gasps]

190
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,625
[NOZOMI, KAZANE groan]

191
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,541
Ow. Sorry. Are you okay?

192
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,333
Whoa, Aoba. I had no idea
you were so stacked.

193
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,250
Hey, don't be mad!

194
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,458
If it weren't for your
massive jugs, I'd be hurtin'.

195
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,916
I'm just glad I ran into you
instead of Miyata.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,375
[SAYAKA]
'Scuse me?!

197
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,875
Who'd've thought bouncing
a beach ball off our hineys

198
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,416
would be this difficult?

199
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,958
Yeah, no kidding. This is
harder than I thought it'd be.

200
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's try directing each
other towards the ball.

201
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,416
--[NOZOMI] Cool with me!
--[NON] Sounds good!

202
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,666
[NOZOMI] Miyata, the wind's
blowing it over your way!

203
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,125
I see it!

204
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,041
[NOZOMI]
More to the left!

205
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,583
Okay, got it!

206
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,291
[SAYAKA] I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there!

207
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,500
Toyoguchi!

208
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,625
I'm ready!

209
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,000
[NOZOMI]
Move up! You need to get closer!

210
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,166
Whoa, that's too much! Get back!

211
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,416
Aw, c'mon! You didn't
have to go that far!

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,458
Yeah, I see it now!

213
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,041
Uh-oh!

214
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,583
Oh goodness gracious.
Sorry I got in your way, Aoba.

215
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,625
[NOZOMI] It's all good,
ladies. Let's try again!

216
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,583
[NON] It's moving
towards you, Nozomin!

217
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,916
[SAYAKA]
Keep going straight ahead!

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,250
[NON]
Ah mah lawd!

219
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,916
That darn thang's
gone cattywampus,

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,208
you'd better skedaddle!

221
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,833
I have no clue what you're
tryin' to say to me.

222
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, dagnabbit, it's fixin'
ta fall right behind ya!

223
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,458
To the left, Nozomi!

224
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,125
[NOZOMI]
All right, I got this!

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,291
[NOZOMI sighs]

226
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,166
It's impossible to understand
Non's accent. Right?

227
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,666
[NON] Oh, dear, we were
so close this round.

228
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,000
[NOZOMI]
We'll get there.

229
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,000
[HITOMI]
Time's up!

230
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,291
We didn't even
complete one toss.

231
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,583
[HITOMI] Looks like
room 309 came in last.

232
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,416
You girls will stay after class
and give me 100 figure-eights.

233
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,041
[ALL groan]

234
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,208
[GIRLS] Ninety-eight.
Ninety-nine. One hundred!

235
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:06,625
[HITOMI] Good work.
You're done, ladies. Dismissed.

236
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,083
It's over!

237
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,625
We can't let this happen
again tomorrow, you guys!

238
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,833
Do you think we should
try changing places?

239
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,375
That's not the problem.

240
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,083
We could change
positions all day long

241
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,500
and it wouldn't
make any difference.

242
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,125
Well then, what is it?

243
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,083
We have to work together.

244
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,416
It's the only way to get
through the challenge.

245
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,375
You need to communicate
with us. Please, Aoba.

246
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,166
[NOZOMI]
It's all about teamwork?

247
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,500
Of course.

248
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,041
That's what today's hip
toss exercise was testing.

249
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,208
I'm all for that,
but not in Keijo.

250
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,916
[NOZOMI] Yeah, I've always
thought of it as more

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,041
of a solo sport.

252
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,625
It might seem that way.

253
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,375
But behind the scenes there's
more teamwork than you'd think.

254
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,291
For example, I've heard
pro Keijo players

255
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,291
who work for the same agency
bounce ideas off one another.

256
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,125
They discuss new tactics before
they try them out on the Land.

257
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,541
Makes sense, if you ask me.

258
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,958
There are a lot of
different factors

259
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,291
you need to take into account

260
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,458
when you're coming up with
your attack strategies.

261
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,750
It would help to have another
player's input on stuff.

262
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,458
It's important we communicate
with each other

263
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,916
in order to get a hip
toss combo going!

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,375
[SAYAKA] That's the
only way it'll happen.

265
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,416
[HITOMI] Today I'll be
testing you and your team

266
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,833
on your hip toss.

267
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,000
You've got 30 minutes to
practice and then we'll begin.

268
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,583
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

269
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,000
I've got a special treat for the
team who comes in first place.

270
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,708
They'll get to taste the most
delicious gelato in Awaji.

271
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,291
[GIRLS gasp]

272
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,458
Why's that special?

273
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,333
And what in the heck
is gelato, anyway?

274
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,916
The elite class was eating it
for breakfast, remember?

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,250
Oh, that stuff!

276
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,375
Now I'm all fired up!

277
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,958
That fancy ice cream
is goin' in my face!

278
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,416
[SAYAKA clears throat]

279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,791
I have an idea that just
might make that happen.

280
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,458
[NOZOMI] Ya think we
should pick a leader?

281
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,708
[SAYAKA]
Yes.

282
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,333
We need one person acting
as everyone's eyes

283
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,541
and giving out the orders.

284
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,916
That's a great idea!

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,375
[NON] Okay, then I nominate
Miyata for team leader!

286
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,250
It's up to you, Aoba.
Are you cool with that?

287
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,958
Get it, Toyoguchi!

288
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,041
[NON]
Will do!

289
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,000
[SAYAKA]
A little more to the right! Uh.

290
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,500
Oh no! The wind blew
it the other way!

291
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,083
No, that's too far left!
Move, uh. Um.

292
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,291
[NON yelps]

293
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,291
That was all my fault.
My orders were awful!

294
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,375
Funny.

295
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,708
I thought it was
coming straight to me,

296
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,333
but it went to Aoba instead!

297
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,583
Heads up, Nozomi!

298
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,708
Got my eye on it!

299
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,125
[SAYAKA]
Move back a little bit!

300
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,708
Okay, now to the left?

301
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,291
Wait, I was wrong!

302
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,166
Ugh, I'm the worst leader ever.

303
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,750
It's no big deal.

304
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,708
It's just weird that it ended
up going right to Aoba again.

305
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,916
[NOZOMI] Aoba's footprints...
Could it be?

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,583
[NOZOMI]
Let's try it again!

307
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,416
[NON] Watch out, Miyata!
It's coming in behind you!

308
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,333
[SAYAKA]
Roger!

309
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,791
[NOZOMI]
It's just as I thought.

310
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,916
[NOZOMI gasps]

311
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
[SAYAKA]
I've got it!

312
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,625
[NON]
Careful, Miyata! Move forward!

313
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,958
[BOTH gasp]

314
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,875
[NOZOMI] Somehow, she knows
where the ball's gonna land!

315
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,666
[NOZOMI]
How are you doing that?

316
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,541
You have to be our
team leader, Aoba!

317
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,000
[KAZANE gasps]

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,125
[SAYAKA]
You honestly think she's been

319
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,875
reading the wind
this whole time?

320
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,041
Is that possible?

321
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,666
[NON]
Sounds farfetched.

322
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,166
There's no other explanation.

323
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,875
Everywhere the ball goes,
she's always right behind it.

324
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,250
Well, I get why you
want her to be leader,

325
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,666
but she doesn't
want the job.

326
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,166
I don't blame her.
It's a lot of responsibility.

327
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,791
[NON] What're we gonna do?
We need a leader!

328
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,500
Don't worry,
'cause I've got an idea!

329
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,000
[HITOMI] So far our highest
combo is 35 consecutive tosses.

330
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,333
Let's move on to our
last team: Room 309.

331
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,416
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

332
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
Hey, Aoba!

333
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,583
Just do what you've
been doin', 'kay?

334
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,666
[HITOMI]
Begin!

335
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,041
[NOZOMI]
Here we go!

336
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,000
[NOZOMI gasps]

337
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,416
Miyata the ball's headed
five diagonal meters

338
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,916
to the left of Aoba!

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,041
Gotcha!

340
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,458
That's one!

341
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,208
This way! It's two meters
to your right, Non!

342
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,041
[NON]
Okie dokie!

343
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,291
This is awesome.

344
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,041
You know exactly where
the ball's gonna land.

345
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,750
I'm simply reading your signals.

346
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,250
And two!

347
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,500
[gasps]

348
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,041
[NOZOMI]
Your ponytail.

349
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,000
Whenever you notice the wind
changing, your ponytail moves!

350
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,833
[NOZOMI]
Three!

351
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,458
As long as I can see your hair,

352
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,958
it's not hard to figure out
where the ball's going.

353
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,166
Wow, that's really smart.

354
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,708
[NOZOMI]
Miyata!

355
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,208
It's five meters to your right
and three meters behind ya!

356
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,625
[SAYAKA]
I'm on it!

357
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,875
[thud]

358
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,458
[NOZOMI]
Your turn, Non!

359
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,500
It's four meters to your left
and then take a small step back!

360
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,666
[NON]
Yeppers!

361
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,916
'Kay, Aoba! You're up!

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,958
[KAZANE gasps]

363
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,375
Looks like you've got
the hang of it now!

364
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,875
This makes 35!

365
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,958
[GIRL F] They've matched
the highest team combo!

366
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,750
How're they doin' it?

367
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,166
Ready, Non? It's two
diagonal meters to your left!

368
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,083
[gasps]

369
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,916

I'm headed that way!

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,041
[gasps]

371
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,375
[KAZANE]
No!

[GIRLS gasp]

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,166
You're wrong! Kaminashi!

374
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,541
It's 15 meters back and two
meters to the left! Trust me!

[BOTH gasp]

[NOZOMI] I've been waiting for
you to finally speak up, Aoba!

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,250
That's 36, baby!

378
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,250
She was waiting on me
to say somethin'?

379
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,625
Great work today.

380
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,333
[NON] Thank you! We couldn't
have done it without ya!

381
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,458
[NOZOMI] We did it, guys!
We're the top team!

382
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,000
Whoops, didn't mean
to knock you over!

383
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,250
Guess you're the
clumsy one not me!

384
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,708
I don't know my own strength!

385
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,625
[NOZOMI]
What?

386
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,958
You were embarrassed of
your Hiroshima accent?

387
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,333
[KAZANE]
Yeah, it may seem silly,

388
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,250
but on the first day you said--

389
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,916
Wow, Non, your accent's the
funniest thing I've ever heard!

390
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,750
[NOZOMI laughs]

391
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,250
You stopped talking because you
thought she'd make fun of you?

392
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,375
In other words,
this is all your fault.

393
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,125
[NOZOMI]
Guess I should watch what I say.

394
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,583
I'm really sorry, y'all.

395
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,833
[NOZOMI] If anyone should
apologize it's me!

396
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,541
Sorry. Um, "y'all."

[SAYAKA] You can be so
insensitive sometimes.

[NOZOMI] It's finally
time for Land class!

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,500
I've been waiting for this day!

00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,416
It feels like it's been forever
since I've been on a Land!

[NOZOMI grunts]

402
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,375
Uh. What do you
think you're doing?

403
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,791
Nothing. I just
noticed your butt.

404
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,708
It looked so firm
I had to touch it.

405
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,458
Whoa, what's going on over here?
That sounded naughty!

406
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,416
What? I meant it's more
muscular than before!

407
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,208
You can't help but notice
everyone's curves

408
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,541
in these swimsuits 'cause
these things are skin tight!

409
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,875
Seriously!

410
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,291
They've helped confirm
what I already suspected.

411
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,625
I knew you had a nice rack,

412
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,375
but didn't know
how nice till today.

[KAZANE gasps]

414
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,875
Stop it! Don't be creepy!

415
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,041
[NOZOMI] There's no need
for you to be embarrassed!

416
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,416
So what cup size are you? A "D"?

417
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,833
Not quite that big, huh?
Lemme guess, a "C"!

418
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,208
Ah-ha! We have the
same cup size!

419
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,208
But... I never.

420
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,541
I know.

421
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,333
Nozomin's having a
conversation with her ponytail!

422
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,458
I don't understand why
Aoba would be embarrassed

423
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,333
by her breasts when
they're a "C" cup.

424
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,000
[HITOMI] I'd like to welcome
you to your first Land class.

425
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,375
We're going to be
starting things off

426
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,458
with a mock race
against the teachers.

427
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,458
We'll be using a basic Land.

428
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,208
Each team of four students
will compete with one teacher.

429
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,833
Four against one, huh?
I like those odds.

430
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,541
[HITOMI] We'll evaluate
your Keijo ability

431
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,833
by going cheek-to-cheek
with you on the Land.

432
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,250
Don't worry about
holding back.

433
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,500
I want you to give me
everything you've got.

[HITOMI yells]

435

Ms. Hokuto's really strong!

436
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,958
I still can't believe
they're gonna make us

437
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,208
play against a teacher!

438
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,666
If we gotta do it,
then we might as well win.

Okay. Up next is room 309.

Why'd we get the seal?

You know she can
hear you, right?

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,666
Ms. Ujibe may not look it now,

444
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,041
but she used to be
quite the prize queen!

Nagisa Ujibe.

She was a top player
in Keijo's early days.

447

Her remarkable beauty
and her playful tactics

448
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:33,250
earned her the nickname
the "Alluring Siren."

about over there?

just how powerful
our team can be!

Hm.

the Butt Gatling
technique, aren't ya?

465

She dodged all of my attacks!

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Now's my chance to strike

468
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,708
while they've got
her distracted!

469
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,333
[NOZOMI]
If I can gain momentum,

470
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,375
then maybe, just maybe,

471
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,000
it'll make my attack
even stronger!

472
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,000
Interesting. Bring
it on, kiddo. Huh?

473
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,166
Take this!

474
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,958
She dodged it!

475
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,583
[gasps]

476
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,583
[ALL gasp]

477
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,125
[ALL scream]

478
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,250
[NON] What in the world
just happened?!

479
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,750
No way. That was...

480
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,375
...a Vacuum Butt Cannon!

481
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,208
Uh. Sorry?

482
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,541
[NON] Nozomin. Why're you
wearing that crazy get-up?

483
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,125
[NOZOMI] All I know
is it's called a UTM.

484
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,875
What's that stand for?

485
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,416
Ujibe's Training Maillot.

486
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,416
You look dumb.

487
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,250
Hey, don't say that.

488
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:47,000
[NOZOMI]
Next time: "Vacuum Butt Cannon!"
