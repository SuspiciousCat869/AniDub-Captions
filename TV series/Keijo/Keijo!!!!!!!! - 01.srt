00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,416
These are the top ten players
in the rankings so far.

160
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,375
[NOZOMI] Why'd they
only list the top ten?

161
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,041
Didn't 40 girls move on?

162
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,083
They should just list
everyone who's passed.

163
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,666
It's for the players
who're trying to get

164
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,916
into the elite class.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,416
Wait, the what now?

166
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,875
[SAYAKA] They told us about
it in orientation, remember?

167
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,291
There are some major perks
to being top ten elite.

168
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,875
They get a curriculum
that's more advanced

169
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,333
than the regular classes.

170
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,041
And they only have to pay
half of their tuition--

171
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,708
[NOZOMI]
What? They only pay half?

172
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,500
When you say "half," do you
mean they get like 50% off?

173
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,875
Well of course, what else
could it possibly mean?

174
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,125
Dummy.

175
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,750
Here we go, ladies.

176
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,083
It's time for the final test of
the Keijo athlete qualifiers.

177
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,625
We're gonna shake
things this round

178
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,916
with a mock race on a Road Land.

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,541
A Road Land? I've never
seen that type before.

180
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,083
The rules are the same
as a normal Keijo match:

181
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,750
You can't use your
hands or feet.

182
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,291
Fall off or touch the Land
with anything but your feet,

183
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,208
you fail.

184
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,000
Any questions before we begin?

185
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:43,875
Yes?

186
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,166
Since this is our last match,

187
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,625
will these results
determine our final grade?

188
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,375
[NAGISA] No, there are
other deciding factors

189
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,916
that we'll consider as well.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,291
In the end, we'll take your
overall score into account.

191
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,833
[NOZOMI] Sure, but our
results on this test

192
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,208
will help determine our
overall score, right?

193
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,458
[NAGISA]
Yeah, of course.

194
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,708
So lemme get this straight,

195
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,291
if I knock more players
off than anybody else,

196
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,958
and I'm the last person left
standing on the Land...

197
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,333
...you're sayin' I still have
a shot at makin' it to the top!

198
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:08,958
[NAGISA]
Hm.

199
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,375
That's right.

200
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,291
[GIRLS cheering]

201
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,750
[NOZOMI]
I'm gonna do it! I'll show ya!

202
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,291
[NAGISA]
All right, everyone,

203
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,083
the final test for the Keijo
athlete qualifiers starts now!

204
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,458
Applicants'll be
put into groups of 12.

205
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,250
The allotted time for this
mock race is ten minutes.

206
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,708
Seems it'll be easier to
move around on this Land.

207
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,333
Whoa. I've never been on one
of these before, have you?

208
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,958
Yeah. It was the first time
I played against Miyata.

209
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,375
But that Land was a lot smaller

210
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,375
than this one and
not nearly as stable.

211
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,666
[SAYAKA]
It's certainly not as cramped,

212
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,916
so we've got plenty of
room to move around.

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,333
But I don't know if
that'll make it any easier.

214
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,625
It may actually require
more energy and focus

215
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,458
than the one at try-outs.

216
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,208
Five seconds until
the race begins.

217
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,458
Four. Three. Two. One.

218
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,791
[SAYAKA] Everyone's waiting to
see what their opponents do.

219
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,041
If we wanna attack,

220
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,583
we have to run across
this floating pathway.

221
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,666
[YUME]
What in the--?

222
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,791
I shouldn't've
let my guard down!

223
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,000
Whoa, what intense air pressure!

224
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,333
She's stronger than she looks!

225
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,708
Her butt muscles are incredible!

226
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,250
Hey, where're you goin'?

227
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,791
[SAYAKA]
Don't follow her, Nozomi.

228
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,875
[KAGAMI] You should really be
payin' attention, Princess.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,791
Think you're tough?
You're not winnin' this round!

230
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,083
[SACHIKO] Your moves aren't too
shabby for a former Judo player.

231
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,083
[NOZOMI yelps]

232
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,041
[YUME] You underestimated
the difficulty of this Land.

233
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,166
Keep running like that,
you'll slip and fall.

234
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,333
This narrow path makes
it hard to balance.

235
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,458
As much as I hate it,
I guess I'll have to retreat.

236
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,416
No way! You snuck up on me!

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,875
I'm surrounded!

238
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,541
You're mine!

239
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,875
[gasps]

240
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,000
And she sticks the landing!

241
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,958
Looks like you're the
monkey in the middle!

242
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,000
[thud]

243
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,458
I'm not gonna let her win!

244
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,000
As soon as I knock
you off the Land,

245
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,000
I promise I'll finish her off.

246
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,666
[NOZOMI]
Take this! Butt Cannon!

247
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,958
[MIHO, YUME scream]

248
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:44,291
[MIKU] Number 565, Miki,
and number 489, Oono,

249
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,916
have fallen into the water!

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,041
Loser!

251
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:47,791
[chuckles]

252
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,250
Two down!

253
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,958
[KAGAMI, SAYO scream]

254
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,000
[MIKU]
Number 642, Oguri, and number...

255
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,291
I should've known.

256
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,416
Still using your speed
like you did in Judo.

257
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,666
I've found a method that works,

258
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,375
so why would I
bother to change it?

259
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,625
[ASUKA]
Sorry 'bout this,

260
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,375
but we gotta take you out
so we can survive.

261
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,041
[NOZOMI]
What do I do?

262
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,458
[HANABI] Move one step
to your left, please.

263
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,416
[chuckles]

264
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,541
Do you mind if I play, too?

265
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,458
[MIKU] Number 603, Nara, has
fallen into the water. Loser!

266
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,708
Whoa. Um. They're out cold.

267
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,333
[NOZOMI]
No way. What's with this girl?

268
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:45,250
She's knocking them out,
but how's she doing it?

269
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,791
[chuckles]

270
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,875
Aw, what's the matter?

271
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,125
You're afraid to take me on

272
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,916
without your friends to
back you up, aren't ya?

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,125
That's the thing with bullies,
they're really cowards.

274
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,541
Why, you!

275
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,791
[MIKU] Number 544, Iori,
has fallen. Loser!

276
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,500
Here she comes!

277
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,416
[NOZOMI gasps]

278
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,875
[NOZOMI]
She's fast!

279
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,583
A direct hit!

280
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,375
[HANABI gasps]

281
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,666
I'm glad I figured out
what happened to the others.

282
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,083
If I hadn't, I'd totally
be a goner right now.

283
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,333
Whaddaya mean?

284
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,875
I noticed you hit 'em
in the front of the jaw,

285
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,291
which shakes their brain
and knocks 'em out.

286
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,166
I had no clue Keijo players
used such awesome strategies.

287
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,666
Gotta say, I'm impressed!

288
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,125
If anyone's impressed, it's me,
'cause I thought I'd won!

289
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,833
I didn't expect you
to pull your jaw back

290
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,666
and slam your face into my butt!

291
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,416
To be honest, I was disappointed

292
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,708
by the lack of talent
in this mock battle.

293
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,500
But now I'm excited!

294
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,666
[SACHIKO]
Got you now!

295
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,000
You can't top me with
those mini melons!

296
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,916
[SACHIKO gasps]

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,958
[SACHIKO]
What the hell?

298
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,500
Those giant boobs were her butt?

299
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,250
[HANABI]
Sure-Kill.

300
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,125
Butt Guillotine!

301
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,458
Wow, you dodged it!

302
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,666
You just don't know
when to give up, do ya?

303
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,250
[NOZOMI]
This girl's insane!

304
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,875
It's like she's aiming
straight for my vital organs.

305
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,375
How'm I supposed to fight her

306
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,250
when I don't know which one
she's gonna shoot for next?

307
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,083
Only one thing to do!

308
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,458
Wha--?

309
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,583
It's my... Bust to Bust Attack!

310
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,958
[HANABI]
What're you doing?

311
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,125
[NOZOMI] Oh, please!
You know exactly what I'm doing.

312
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,208
As long as I'm this close,

313
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,750
you can't use your
pinpoint attacks!

314
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,458
[HANABI] Okay, you got me,
but the same goes for you!

315
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,583
It's not like you can attack
within close range!

316
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,500
Oh, yeah? Watch me!

317
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,083
[HANABI chuckles]

318
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,125
[HANABI] You want a real fight?
Fine, I won't hold back anymore.

319
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,875
Only one of us can
win and that's me.

320
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,458
No, I won't lose! I have to win!

321
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,250
Y'know, you're pretty
good at this.

322
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,166
You've got plenty of power but
you need to learn how to use it.

323
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,333
I'll teach you.

324
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,666
Lesson one: Boobs can
do more than push.

325
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,666
I may be new to Keijo,
but I'm not stupid.

326
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,208
I know what they can do!

327
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,375
[HANABI laughs]

328
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,958
Oh, goodie! That was
fun! You're amazing!

329
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,541
[MIKU]
Thirty seconds remaining!

330
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,041
[NOZOMI] I won't get anywhere
if I just keep pushing into her.

331
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,583
This time I'll go in hard
and knock her off!

332
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,750
Thought you could attack me?

333
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,458
You already tried
that move on me.

334
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,333
Looks like you're
running out of tricks!

335
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,250
You're goin' down!

336
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,541
I don't get it.

337
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,666
No one's ever broken down
my moves this fast before!

338
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,375
I've had it with you!

339
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,333
[NOZOMI]
This is it! Game over!

340
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,500
[NAGISA]
Kawai dodged her attack!

341
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,916
Nozomi!

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,041
[NAGISA] And used the opening
to hit Kaminashi's jaw!

343
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,458
[HANABI]
Down you go!

344
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,250
This match was fun!
Thanks for playin'.

345
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,416
Let's do it again sometime.

346
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:31,375
[NOZOMI]
I can't believe it. I lost.

347
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:35,083
There are so many
strong competitors.

348
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:40,166
Keijo is... amazing!

349
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,125
[NOZOMI]
Everything changed that day.

350
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,500
I always thought
I'd be satisfied

351
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,250
just bein' another Keijo
player, you know?

352
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,875
The salary is great,
the competitions are fun,

353
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,333
and you get to travel
all across the country.

354
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,833
But then, I tried my best to win
a race and I ended up losing.

355
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,625
That experience changed
my whole way of thinking.

356
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:07,083
I wanna win more than anything.

357
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,708
I was sure I flunked out.

358
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,250
So imagine my surprise when I
got my letter sayin' I passed.

359
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,000
But I'm still so
angry with myself

360
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,333
for bein' a pathetic loser.

361
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,958
We'll both get stronger
if we work hard.

362
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,750
It just takes time.

363
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,375
I've been meanin' to ask,
why'd you start playin' Keijo?

364
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,958
From what I've heard you were
pretty awesome at Judo.

365
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,500
I guess so.

366
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,250
This might sound weird, but I
like wearing cute swimsuits.

367
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,625
Uh. You know what I mean!

368
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,791
If you're a popular player,

369
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,041
then you get a personal
swimsuit designer.

370
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,916
It's their job to create a
signature suit just for you.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,541
I've always thought that
would be kinda cool.

372
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,666
I dunno. I've got other reasons
but it doesn't matter.

373
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,708
[CROWD cheering]

374
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,666
[NOZOMI] Oh! I can't wait
to get out there again!

375
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,083
[SAYAKA]
Me either.

376
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,750
You'll find your room
numbers listed on the wall.

377
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,666
Well? Have you found
your name yet?

378
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
No. It's not up there.

379
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,041
If neither of us are listed,
it can only mean one thing.

380
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,375
Looks like you're gonna be
stuck with me as a roomie.

381
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,125
Hooray.

382
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,208
[YUKO]
Like it or not,

383
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,375
you guys are definitely
sharing a room.

384
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,791
Hey, Ooshima! This
means you passed, huh?

385
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,166
Of course I did!
There's one problem.

386
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,291
[YUKO groans]

387
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,291
I did so poorly on
the exam's mock race

388
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,250
that they bumped me down from
elite class to regular class.

389
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,250
That said, I think you
guys might actually

390
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,416
have it worse than me.

391
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,000
[NOZOMI]
Whaddaya mean?

392
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,833
I hate to tell ya, but the room
you're in, 309, is kinda cursed.

393
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,291
From what I've been told, it's
known as the "Empty Room."

394
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,041
Why do they call it that?

395
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,666
[YUKO] Apparently it's where
they send the students

396
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,083
most likely to quit Setouchi

397
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,166
because they can't keep
up with the classes.

398
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
They call it the "Empty Room"

399
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,750
because it empties out
so fast every semester.

400
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,875
[NOZOMI]
What? Are you serious?

401
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,791
This is where they send
the failures, huh?

402
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,625
How did we end up
in this stupid room?

403
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,875
I mean, we're winners!

404
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,583
[SAYAKA]
Let's just go in.

405
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,583
[NON chuckles]

406
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,125
We'll be joining the
Empty--Uh! Room 309!

407
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,125
Hey, we're your roommates.

408
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,458
I'm Nozomi Kaminashi.

409
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,875
I'm so thrilled to be
in here, I could scream!

410
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,916
My name is Sayaka Miyata.
Nice to meet you.

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,083
Hi! It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

412
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,416
Anyway, I'm Non Toyoguchi.

413
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
I look forward to getting
to know you ladies better.

414
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,166
Wow! Your voice is
too stinkin' cute!

415
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,083
[NON] Uh! I almost forgot,
I brought something for you.

416
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,208
It's a little treat
from my hometown.

417
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,583
[NOZOMI]
How thoughtful of you!

418
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,291
[SAYAKA] Um. Thank you.
May I ask where you're from?

419
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,833
[NON] Believe it or not,
I came all the way...

420
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,666
[NOZOMI]
Um. Hey, there.

421
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,666
Oh, hi. I'm Kazane Aoba.

422
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,208
'Kay. Is that all you got?

423
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,000
So do you have a preference
for which bed you get?

424
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,000
I would imagine the closer
you are to the hallway,

425
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,250
the louder that it'll...

426
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,083
...be!

427
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,166
Oh, no!

428
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,458
Uh-oh! Are you okay?

429
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,208
Why wouldn't I be?

430
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,500
[NOZOMI] That looked like
it hurt. You're even crying!

431
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,708
[yelps]

432
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,125
[NON]
No, I'm not!

433
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,958
You're seeing things.
I'm perfectly fine!

434
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,416
[NOZOMI] You're not foolin' me.
Your nose is bright red.

435
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,375
Don't know what
you're talking 'bout!

436
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,750
My friends and family back home

437
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,958
are always saying
how clumsy I am.

438
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,500
[NOZOMI, SAYAKA]
Can ya really blame 'em?

439
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,791
They tried to talk me out
of being a Keijo player,

440
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,333
but I didn't listen.

441
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm gonna to go out there and
make a name for mah village!

442
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,791
Your what?

443
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,125
Mah village back home
in Kagoshima, silly!

444
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,041
People'a been movin' away
but I got a plan! Ha!

445
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,666
Ah reckon gettin' famous'll
bring tourists to town.

446
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,916
[NOZOMI, SAYAKA]
You "reckon"?

447
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,916
Ah! Ah'm doin' it again!

448
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,166
What in tarnation's
gotten into me?

449
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,000
I try to hide my accent so
I'm easier to understand.

450
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,458
Yeah, you're gonna
have to try harder.

451
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,458
Anyway, let's work together
to make our training awesome!

452
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,791
Whaddaya say? You in, Aoba?

453
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,916
[NOZOMI, SAYAKA]
Whoa. No reaction at all!

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,250
[sighs]

455
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,416
Great, my roommates have
such unique personalities.

456
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,583
I'm not looking forward to this.

457
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,791
[NOZOMI]
Hey, what's that you're readin'?

458
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:11,125
Cool! A Keijo mag! Would you
mind if I take a look?

459
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
Aw, c'mon, just a quick peek!

460
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,541
[SAYAKA] I should've known
she'd turn out to be

461
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,000
the biggest troublemaker
of them all!

462
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,583
I'm so sorry! Help me out here!

463
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,333
Uh, Toyoguchi? Happen
to have any tape on ya?

464
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,791
Yeah. But all I've
got is duct tape.

465
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,500
Great! That should do the trick!

466
