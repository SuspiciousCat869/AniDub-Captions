1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,583
If you ask me, you're way too
talented for the regular class.

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,125
[ALL gasp]

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,833
Hello, ladies. I'm the fastest
outfighter in Western Japan.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,083
Rin Rokudo.

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,708
Nice to meet ya.

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,875
I seriously doubt that you're
the fastest, but whatever.

7
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,208
[RIN] The others are lame and
none of them even come close

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,875
to being in my league
as an outfighter.

9
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,291
There's an event coming that's
going to shake things up.

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,666
It'll be fun for us, but maybe
not so much for your roommates.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,958
An event, huh?

12
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,541
[RIN]
Yep, the class-change race!

13
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,250
[MIKU]
Five seconds to start.

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,416
Four. Three. Two. One.

15
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,833
This'll be easy.

16
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:01,666
Huh?

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,458
[SAYAKA]
You're going down!

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,250
[RIN chuckles]

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,708
How'd she dodge my attack?

20
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,666
And she did it at
the very last second!

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,291
She's faster than I thought.

22
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,000
[RIN laughs]

23
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,958
I'll admit that you
caught me off guard.

24
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,458
So you really wanna
do this, huh?

25
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,875
You know, rushing me at the
beginning of the race like that

26
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,875
wasn't a very smart move.

27
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,833
Let's not forget I'm
the fastest outfighter

28
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,250
in all of Western Japan.

29
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,791
[SAYAKA]
You keep saying that,

30
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,083
but I think we all know
better than to believe it.

31
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,583
Oh?

32
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,958
Well then, if I'm not the
fastest, then tell me who is.

33
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,541
Isn't it obvious? That'd be me.

34
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,875
Ha! Hold up, you seriously
think you're the fastest?

35
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,916
Wow. Looks like I'm gonna
have to teach you a lesson.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,333
You're nowhere near my level.

37
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,958
[NARRATOR] In the past,
gamblers have been limited

38
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,541
to horse, bike, boat,
and car races.

39
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,750
but now there's a new form
of legalized gambling

40
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,958
sweeping the nation.

41
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,000
It's called Keijo!

42
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,041
Players compete to be
the last girl standing

43
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,541
atop a floating platform
called a "Land."

44
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,541
The kicker? They can only
use their boobs and butts!

45
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,041
The question is:
Who will rule the Land?

46
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,000
Will it be the 18-year-old
Nozomi Kaminashi?

47
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,375
She's one of the
many young ladies

48
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,333
whose search for fame
and fortune has lead them

49
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,291
to the world of Keijo!

50
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,666
And this is the story of their
journey to becoming champions!

51
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,250
Whoa, that's a lot of
power for a single attack.

52
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,125
Actually, she hit
them ten times.

53
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,375
[HARUMI]
What the--?

54
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,041
[HARUMI, KURURU yelp]

55
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,375
[MIKU] Konishi and Nemoto
overboard! Loser!

56
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,166
Did you see that? The Land
tilted over to one side!

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,125
Well yeah, that's how
the Seesaw Land works.

58
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,833
It's a hemisphere shape so it
has a weak center of gravity

59
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,916
which makes it sway more
than the other types.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This thing's intense, huh?

61
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,208
Much better. Now it's
your turn to go down!

62
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,791
Wow.

63
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,916
I thought you were all talk,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,083
but somehow you're
keepin' up with me.

65
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,708
It just means that I'll have
to move a little faster!

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,750
[chuckles]

67
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,375
[gasps]

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,375
[RIN] Havin' a hard
time now, aren't ya?

69
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,333
That's crazy!
How's she movin' so fast?

70
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,375
She's good. She's quick
and she's a great fighter.

71
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,875
[SAYAKA yelps]

72
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,958
Hang on, Miyata!

73
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,375
This is bad. She's been pushed
to the end of the Land.

74
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,083
One false move and
she's going overboard!

75
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,625
[RIN]
Talk about boring.

76
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,000
You claim to be the fastest
and that's all you've got?

77
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,125
Well, this was great,
but I'm over it.

78
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,208
You should do some
speed training

79
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,083
before you fight me again.

80
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,750
Thanks for playin',
but it's game over for you!

81
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,583
Wow, you're gullible.

82
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,625
[RIN gasps]

83
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,041
She was faking!

84
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,250
She pretended to be off-balance
so I'd go in for the big finish.

85
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,541
You'll never be the fastest

86
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,125
with that giant ego
slowing you down.

87
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,541
[SAYAKA]
Triple-Thrust Hurricane Attack!

88
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,666
I don't know how you just upped
your speed all of a sudden.

89
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,875
Unless, you were
pretending to be slow

90
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,250
so you could set up your attack!

91
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,750
How humiliating.

92
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,625
I can't believe she
was holding back on me.

93
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,416
How could I be so stupid?

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,708
I didn't notice her plan to
trick me 'cause I was cocky!

95
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,708
[NON] My goodness, it looks like
Rokudou's awfully frustrated.

96
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,750
[NOZOMI] Good! That means
Miyata hit a nerve!

97
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,875
She could win this, you guys!

98
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,916
[MIO]
Don't be so sure.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,208
She got a decent attack in,

100
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,375
but only because Rin-rin
had her guard down.

101
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,041
It was a solid effort, but it
didn't do nearly enough damage

102
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,750
to take her out of the race.

103
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,250
I went at her with
everything I've got,

104
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,333
and I still couldn't land
a single hit on her.

105
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,208
Even her reactions are fast.

106
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,916
I'm not falling for
your tricks again.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,333
So don't even
bother here on out!

108
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,958
It's over for ya.

109
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,166
I'm gonna make sure
I beat you this time!

110
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,875
Let's go! Butt Gatling!

111
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,458
[SAYAKA]
Don't count me out yet!

112
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,666
[yells]

113
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,083
She's repelling all
of Rin-rin's attacks!

114
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,500
They're both moving so fast.

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,750
It's a battle of sheer will!

116
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,791
I never thought I'd find a girl
fast enough to keep up with me,

117
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,208
much less in the regular class.

118
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,000
I guess I've gotta accept it.

119
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,541
I've finally found someone
worthy of fighting.

120
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,833
There's no denyin'
you're quick and strong.

121
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,166
That said, it's still not enough
for me to feel threatened.

122
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,583
They're really going at it!

123
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,166
Yeah, it's one big
blur of butts!

124
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,083
[chuckles]

125
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,458
What happened?

126
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,000
It looked like Miyata
stopped movin' for a second.

127
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,666
[RIN yells]

128
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,208
She's strong!

129
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,708
Do you think maybe
Miyata's hurt

130
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,583
and that's why she's getting
pushed to the edge?

131
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,333
No. She's fine.

132
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,208
But her breathing's off.

133
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,375
It looks like she's
oxygen deprived!

134
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,166
Just fall already!

135
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,791
It takes a lot of concentration
to move so quickly.

136
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,500
She prob'ly holds her breath
when she's attacking.

137
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,166
She's not breathing
while she fights?

138
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,666
If that's true,

139
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,125
then shouldn't Rokudou also
be oxygen-deprived right now?

140
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,166
'Cause she hasn't
slowed down at all.

141
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,583
[HANABI] There's more to
Rin-rin than just her speed.

142
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,333
[NON]
What do you mean by that?

143
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,291
Well, she happens to have an
extremely large lung capacity.

144
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,958
[NOZOMI]
Why's that matter?

145
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,958
[HANABI] Miyata and Rin-rin
are basically even

146
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,833
when it comes to their
speed and reflexes.

147
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,541
But there's one area where
Rin-rin has an advantage.

148
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,833
And that's lung capacity.

149
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,041
[HANABI] Their Butt
Gatlings may be equal,

150
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,625
but Rin-rin has
more "ammunition"

151
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,708
because she's never
gasping for air.

152
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,958
[RIN] I can take a hundred
shots with a single breath!

153
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,166
Bet you can't do that, can ya?!

154
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,375
[yelps]

155
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,208
It's been fun, but this is it.

Oh no, she's gonna
lose the race!

157
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,958
Thirty seconds.

00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,125
No, she won't.

159
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,291
How do you know?

160
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,708
She's worked hard.

161
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,083
Miyata has been training
every day. She won't give up.

162
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,500
She's been looking
for a technique

163
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,833
that'll make her the
fastest Keijo player.

164
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,208
And now she's finally found it.

165
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,333
[SAYAKA]
Three. Two. One.

166
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:35,083
[SAYAKA]
W-Acceleration. Activate!

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,875
Her swimsuit!

168
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,291
She wedged it up her butt!

169
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,416
Do you think that's
gonna help you?

170
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,000
How the hell did
she get over here?

171
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,750
Whoa. She's fast!

172
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,291
What was that? It's like her
ass disappeared for a sec.

173
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,875
But she couldn't pull that off.

174
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,958
She's not fast enough!

175
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,333
[SAYAKA]
Too slow.

176
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,666
[RIN]
No way!

177
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,000
My goodness!

178
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,083
What's going on?
Why's she so fast now?

179
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:11,208
I don't get it. All she did
was give herself a wedgie!

180
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,791
Pulling her swimsuit up like
that cuts down on resistance,

181
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,166
thereby increasing her
hips' range of motion.

182
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,375
Sorry, I'm not
followin', Kazane.

183
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,666
Our swimsuits are thin,

184
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,583
but they still exert
pressure and constrain us.

185
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,750
The faster you move, the
more that pressure builds up

186
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,083
and it eventually starts
to slow you down.

187
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,708
But when you pull your suit up,

188
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,375
it instantly reduces
the pressure

189
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,416
and allows you to gain speed.

190
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,333
[RIN]
Damn it! She's too fast!

191
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,541
That's it. You're done.

192
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,000
You won't defeat me!

193
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,875
Just watch me!
I'm going to win this race!

194
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,208
[RIN]
I may not have a big butt

195
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,333
or giant boobs
like everybody else,

196
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,958
but I've got super speed
and that's enough!

197
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,958
But how? We both lunged
at the same time.

198
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,750
[gasps]

199
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,166
[SAYAKA]
You're quick,

200
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,541
but you'll have to settle for
being the second fastest

201
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,375
outfighter in Western
Japan from now on.

202
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,791
[RIN screams]

203
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,916
[MIKU]
Rokudou overboard. Loser!

204
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:25,958
[MIKU] Class-change race, group
one, winner: Sayaka Miyata.

205
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,375
[NOZOMI] Hell yeah!
I knew you could do it!

206
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,708
I can't believe
Rin-rin was defeated!

207
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,000
[MIO laughs]

208
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,708
She kinda deserved it.

209
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,750
[gasps]

210
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,916
Oh no, she fell!

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,750
What's the matter,
Miyata? Are you okay?

212
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm fine, just wiped.

213
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,541
[RIN]
Think I figured it out.

214
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,041
You knew you couldn't keep
that crazy speed up for long.

215
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,000
That's why you waited
to use your new technique

216
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,583
until the last 30
seconds of the match.

217
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,250
Gotta admit, I'm
seriously impressed

218
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,125
you came up with that
all on your own.

219
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,125
I can't call myself
the fastest outfighter

220
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,000
in Western Japan anymore.

221
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,625
Guess I'll hafta be "the fastest
outfighter in Western Japan,

222
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,750
excluding Sayaka
Miyata" for a while.

223
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,541
How very humble.

224
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,791
I'm pretty bummed that I lost,

225
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,250
but I'm glad I got to
race against you today.

226
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,375
We should train together
and then try this again.

227
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,916
I think it'd be fun, don't you?

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,416
Fair warning though,
next time we race,

229
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,541
I'm totally kicking your butt.

230
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,833
[rubber stretching]

231
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:30,500
[SAYAKA groaning]

232
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,500
Ow, that hurts! Be careful.

233
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,208
[SAYAKA]
I'm really sore.

234
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,583
She worked her muscles so hard,
they're completely stiff.

235
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,916
[SAYAKA]
Please don't push so hard.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,625
[NON] Are you okay?
I wish I could help somehow.

237
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,500
[NOZOMI] I feel bad for Miyata.
She's so beat up.

238
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,416
I guess it's the only
way to win though.

239
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,666
You gotta hit the
elite class-ers

240
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,083
with everything you've got.

241

minutes until your race.

Oh. It looks like it's my turn
to get out there and fight.

245
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,416
Okay!

246
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,041
I'm gonna follow in
Miyata's footsteps and win!

247
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:12,291
Non Toyoguchi is about to
show 'em a real Keijo battle!

248
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,125
[NON]
I talked a big game poolside,

249
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,083
but now I'm scared to death.

250
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,500
[NANA yells]

251
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,541
I'm advancing to the
elite class, not you!

252
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,875
[NON]
What should I do?

253
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,166
I feel kinda silly 'cause
I'm just standing here.

254
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,333
Oh, poor Non. Think
she's gonna be okay?

255
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,958
[SAYAKA grunts]

256
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,875
This race is as good as done!

257
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,500
All it will take is one hit!

258
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,791
We'll see about that.

259
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,083

260
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,000
Ow!

261
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,041
[NOZOMI]
That's crazy!

262
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,208
The attacking player
was sent flying!

263
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,916
[ATSUKO]
The Ass of Vajra.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,625
When I tighten my butt, it
becomes as strong as steel

265
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,833
and easily blocks any attack.

266
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,250
You see, my ass is
the ultimate shield,

267
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,250
deflecting whatever may hit it.

268
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:02,166
And thus, it can become...
the ultimate weapon!

269
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,583
[MIKU] Ooshima and Gotsui
are overboard. Loser!

270

You must be terrified,
little girl.

272

In that case, let me go ahead
and put you out of your misery.

273
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,208
Stay away from her, Non!

274
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,083
One hit from her and you'll
be knocked overboard!

00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,333
What just happened?

285
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:01,250
[MIKU] Class-change race, group
two, winner: Non Toyoguchi.

286
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,000
So she absorbed
Yoshida's attack

287
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,083
and then shot it
right back at her?

288
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,291
Exactly, Toyoguchi's
got soft buns

289
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,041
that can assassinate
enemy asses.

290
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,125
[NOZOMI]
I guess whatever works for ya.

291
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,083
I did it, you guys!
I actually won the race!

292
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,166
[NOZOMI, NON]
Yay!

293
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,500
Dunno why you're celebrating,
you just got lucky!

294
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,791
[NON] That's not true! You
take that back right now!

295
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,458
[NOZOMI]
Chill out, Non, you won.

296
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,916
Does it really matter
whether it was luck or not?

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,083
Of all people, I thought you'd
have a little more faith in me.

298
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,125
Hmph.

299
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,500
[MIKU]
Members of group three,

please make your
way to the front.

Time for me to get out there.

302

I'm gonna make you
guys proud. I promise!

Follow my lead and
kick their heineys!

Yeah, go get 'em, tiger!

compete atop a Pole-Type Land.

This'll be tough.

I get to compete against
all these lovely ladies.

It's almost as if
I have my own harem.

00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,583
No stress, girl!
You've got this thing!

315
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,250
[RIN] This race'll
be over in seconds.

316
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,208
Yeah, Mio won't have any
trouble taking those three out.

317
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,541
Kazane's a lot stronger
than you think she is.

318
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,166
Kusakai got first place
in the entrance exams.

319
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,833
Doesn't matter if it's a
practice match or what,

320
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,583
she never loses.

321
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,458
[HANABI]
If anyone's a Keijo prodigy,

322
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,041
it's most definitely
Mio Kusakai.

323
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:35,333
[NON] Don't listen to them.
Aoba can win this!

324
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,791
[MIKU]
Five seconds.

325
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Four. Three. Two. One.

326
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,333
[bell rings]

327
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,708
Ooh!

328
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,500
Did she just charge
in by herself?

329
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,916
Yeah, that was crazy!

330
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,291
You caught me by surprise.

331
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,416
I wasn't expecting anyone
to come rushing at me

332
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,791
as soon as the bell rang.

333
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,333
What'll I do with you?

334
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,833
I know, when this race is over,

335
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,333
how would you like
to come home with me?

336
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,333
[yells]

337
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,791
[MIO laughs]

338
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,666
Your bravery's a turn on,
but you'd better be careful.

339
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,958
You don't wanna be too reckless.

340
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,333
If you wanna sink me,

341
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,791
your best bet is teaming up
with the other hotties

342
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,750
and working together
to take me down.

343
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,708
She's got a point!
You can't beat her alone!

344
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,375
Team up with the others!

345
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,583
Don't worry, guys.

346
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,583
Aoba's got it under control.

347
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,916
[yells]

348
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,041
Your friends sure
are distracting.

349
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:29,125
Don't they know how hard this is
for a shy little cutie like you?

350
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,291
Oh no, she's hurt!

351
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,166
[KAZANE coughs]

352
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,750
[MIO]
Done already?

353
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,166
I was hoping you'd last longer
so that we could have some fun.

354
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,375
Now, Shimada.
This is our chance!

355
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,541
[gasps]

356
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,166
How did she get
in my blind spot?

357
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,166
Okay, you're up next, Horiuchi!

358
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
[MOMO]
Roger!

359
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,250
That wallflower is giving
the others orders?

360
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,791
Sorry, she got away from me!

361
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,875
No problem! I expected her
to dodge in that direction.

362
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,666
Wait a second, how'd you figure
out which way I would dodge?

363
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,458
I know all about you, your
moves, and your techniques.

364
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,166
Everything.

365
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,875
Thanks to my Scanning Hand!

366
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,208
You got that info
from your hand?

367
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,125
[KAZANE]
That's right.

368
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,458
All I have to do
is touch someone

369
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,041
and then my right
hand reads them.

370
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,458
It gives me their condition
and even their habits.

371
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,416
For example, you tend
to favor your left leg

372
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,833
because it's much more
flexible than your right one.

373
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,375
So when you're attacked,
you always dodge right.

374
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,666
Get it now?

375
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,541
Ooh.

376
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,458
I don't remember letting you use
this "Scanning Hand" of yours.

377
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,833
I used it on everyone in
school when I gave massages.

378
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:48,208
[NON] See? Now you'll be able
to get data on everybody!

379
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,166
Seriously?

380
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,291
We were kinda skeptical
when she told us all of this

381
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,666
before the race.

382
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,125
But we decided we might as
well play along with her

383
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,166
'cause we wanna beat you.

384
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,750
I know every move you're gonna
make before you even make it.

385
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,583
There's no way that
you're gonna win.

386
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,500
Wow.

387
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,958
[MOMO, AI yell]

388
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,708
Sheesh.

389
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,291
[KAZANE] You can run all you
want, but I'll still catch you.

390
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,666
There's no escaping me.

391
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,791
Good job! Way to go, Kazane!

392
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,333
Well, what did I tell you?

393
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,041
I had no doubt she was
gonna pull out a win today.

394
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
Aren't you clever?

395
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,291
I must admit,
teaming up against me

396
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,541
and then blocking my every
move is a brilliant strategy.

397
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:34,625
[laughing]

398
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,250
What in the--?

399
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,500
Why'd she change her
stance like that?

400
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,000
She's standing there...
swaying her boobs.

401
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,916
[MIO]
Fantastic!

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,583
You're an even better Keijo
player than I imagined, Aoba.

403
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,125
[laughing]

404
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,416
What is she doing?

405
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,875
[laughing]

406
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,958
She keeps laughing.

00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:02,000
[laughing]

408
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,291
[KAZANE] What in the
world did she do to me?

409
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,583
I'm stuck!
I can't move a muscle!

410
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,958
[SAYAKA] I don't like this.
Something seems off.

411
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,708
[NOZOMI] They're just starin'
at each other. What's goin' on?

412
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,500
[KAZANE]
I can't... even speak.

413
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,041
No. It can't be.

414
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,291
Sorry, girlfriend.

415
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,375
[KAZANE]
No way!

416
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,666
She used... Titty Hypnosis?

417
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
[MIKU] Aoba, Shimada,
and Horiuchi are overboard.

418
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:48,958
Loser!

419
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,666
She went overboard!

420
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,833
[HITOMI] Medics! Get those
girls out of the pool right now!

421
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,041
Hurry!

422
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:04,333
[MIKU] Class-change race, group
three, winner: Mio Kusakai.

423
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,083
[NOZOMI]
But I don't understand.

424
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,875
How did she lose?

425
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,250
[NON]
I have no clue.

426
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,250
I mean, Aoba and the
others had her cornered.

427
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,083
[SAYAKA]
Whatever she did, it must be why

428
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,750
she's the elite class's
number one student.

429
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,083
[NOZOMI]
I just wish we knew what it was.

430
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,750
[SAYAKA] Listen, I know
you're worried about Aoba,

431
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,291
but you need to focus.

432
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,916
Yeah, it's gonna be tough.

[NOZOMI] I don't know anything
about her techniques,

435
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,375
but I do know that no
matter what she tries...

436
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,250
[NOZOMI]
...I'm gonna sink her!
