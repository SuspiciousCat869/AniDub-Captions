1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,166
Man, it's just the usual
rice with raw egg on top,

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,000
but it tastes different somehow.

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,000
Huh, I wonder what's
changed all of a sudden.

4
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,541
[NON] They must use
fancier ingredients

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,333
to make the elite class's meals!

6
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,541
[NOZOMI]
Mh-hm!

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,208
Why're you acting like
this is news to you?

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,500
We've had this conversation
before, Nozomi.

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:33,000
I know! I'm just so happy
to be in elite class!

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,041
[NARRATOR] In the past,
gamblers have been limited

11
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,583
to horse, bike, boat,
and car races.

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,791
But now there's a new form
of legalized gambling

13
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,000
sweeping the nation.

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,041
It's called Keijo!

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,083
Players compete to be
the last girl standing

16
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,583
atop a floating platform
called a "Land."

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,666
The kicker? They can only
use their boobs and butts!

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,083
The question is:
Who will rule the Land?

19
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,041
Will it be the 18-year-old
Nozomi Kaminashi?

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,416
She's one of the
many young ladies

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,375
whose search for fame
and fortune has lead them

22
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,291
to the world of Keijo!

23
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:05,708
And this is the story of their
journey to becoming champions!

24
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,208
[NOZOMI] Honshu's really grown
since the last time I visited.

25
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,750
I mean, this is one heck
of a bridge, huh?

26
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,208
[NON]
Yeah, it's gigantic!

27
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,166
I don't think I've ever
seen one this big before.

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,666
[NOZOMI] Right after we were
promoted to the elite class,

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
we were told that we
would be heading to Kyoto

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,541
for a special Keijo
training camp.

31
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,333
Apparently it's a yearly event
where a select group of students

32
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,208
partake in a bunch of trainin'.

33
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,208
I don't get why we
can't do it in Awaji,

34
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,041
but whatever, I'll go
along for the ride.

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,000
[NOZOMI] So where are
all of the instructors?

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,333
You'd think that they
woulda been here by now.

37
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,750
Do ya think maybe we took
a wrong turn or something?

38
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,125
Ladies, let's not resort
to idle chatter.

39
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,250
Remember why we're here,
former residents of room 309.

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,500
You must stay focused and
ready to learn at all times.

41
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,000
I just contacted the inn
where we'll be staying.

42
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,375
Unfortunately, they don't
have our rooms ready yet

43
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,166
so we can't check in
for a few hours.

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,541
Really?

45
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,791
I honestly didn't think we'd
make it here this early.

46
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,125
There's usually a lot more
traffic on the freeway.

47
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,958
Because of our predicament,
we've decided to give you

48
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,416
three hours of free time
to explore Kyoto.

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,916
We get to venture
out on our own?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,791
For real, you're seriously
gonna let us go check out Kyoto?

51
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,291
That's correct.

52
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,875
Aw, yeah! I'm so glad our
chaperone is Ms. Kobayakawa!

53
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,208
She's a friggin' goddess!

54
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,750
Well, given the hellish
regime you're gonna be on,

55
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,833
you should have some fun
while you can, right?

56
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,791
[GIRLS] Wait, what're
they gonna make us do?

57
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,708
Now I'm kinda scared.

58
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,250
[NOZOMI]
Anyone got a plan?

59
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,708
I would've looked
up things to do,

60
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,791
but I didn't bother 'cause
I figured we'd be trainin'

61
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,791
the whole time we're here.

62
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,708
Yeah, I know, right?

63
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,541
I don't even know
where to start.

64
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,083
Well, uh...

65
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
I know! Why don't
we have a party

66
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,875
to get to know one another?

67
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,125
[NOZOMI]
I dunno.

68
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,375
Why not? You guys
are the newbie elites.

69
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,375
Surely you wanna
meet your classmates.

70
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,666
Now's as good a time
as ever, dontcha think?

71
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
[NOZOMI]
I guess so.

72
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,416
I grew up in Kyoto
so I'd be happy

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,458
to show you ladies around
town if you'd like.

74
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,458
[NON, NOZOMI]
Mh-hm!

75
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,875
Awesome!

76
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,083
There's this cute little café
a few blocks from here

77
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,041
where a bunch of
super-hot guys hang out.

78
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,375
Super-hot guys?

79
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,666
Yeah! Whaddaya say,
you wanna go?

80
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,333
Who knows, maybe one of us'll
meet the man of our dreams!

81
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,916
Can you imagine?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,500
We'll sneak out at night to meet
our new lover by the Kamo River.

83
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,708
[SAYAKA, NON, NOZOMI]
What happened to getting to

84
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,083
know each other?

85
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,500
I dunno. I just don't think
that's such a good idea.

86
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,416
Oh, come on! We're
talkin' about hot guys!

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,916
Uh. Yeah.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,166
I get it, but that wouldn't
be fair to poor Kazane

89
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,000
'cause she's terribly shy.

90
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,291
Please! I can't talk
to men I don't know!

91
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,000
[NON]
I'm sorry, Kazane.

92
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,291
[HANABI] This is your
shot at romance, girl!

93
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,625
[SAYAKA clears throat]

94
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,583
Hey, I know. Why don't
you go see Kyoto with me?

95
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,250
How 'bout a friendly
game of truth or dare?

96
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,916
[NOZOMI]
I don't think so!

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,875
Um. What's the deal
with "truth or dare"?

98
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,083
I've never played it.

99
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,583
What? It's only the
coolest game in history!

100
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,291
I could dare you lovely
ladies to share pocky with me!

101
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,666
I'd get to hear your
deepest secrets...

102
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,791
[NOZOMI, NON, KAZANA]
Kusakai, you're hot as hell,

103
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,083
but sometimes you're
down right creepy.

104
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,916
So I'm gonna have to pass.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,833
Aw! Please play with me!

106
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,750
Then how 'bout you guys
come sight seeing with--

107
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,875
Whatcha doin' with your
free time, Kaminashi?

108
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,083
I'm gonna go work out
if you wanna join.

109
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,208
I heard there's an
awesome gym nearby.

110
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,291
[KOTONE] If you're bored, I can
lend you one of my drama CDs.

111
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,083
Uh. Thanks! Next time.

112
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,750
[SAYAKA]
Dummy.

113
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,041
[sighs]

114
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,708
What has gotten into me?

115
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,208
This is silly. Why'd
I come here by myself?

116
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,083
This is no different
than when I was a kid.

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,958
[GIRL A]
Hey, Sayaka.

118
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,458
A big group of kids are gonna go

119
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,000
and watch the fireworks
after school tomorrow.

120
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,666
Do you wanna come along with us?

121
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,416
[SAYAKA] Tomorrow?
Um, once practice is over--

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,791
Dummy!

123
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,208
You're being so inconsiderate.
Don't bother Sayaka.

124
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,708
She can't watch
fireworks with us

125
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,958
'cause she's got Judo practice.

126
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,333
No, wait. I've got some
time off tomorrow--

127
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,750
[GIRL B] She goes straight
to her family's dojo

128
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,208
after school every day.

129
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,916
Isn't that right, Sayaka?

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,208
Oh. I'm sorry. I hope
I didn't upset you.

131
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,208
Uh-uh. I'm not upset.

132
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,333
I wish she could hang
out, but she can't.

133
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,958
--[GIRL D] I wanna snow cone!
--[GIRL E] What should we do?

134
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,250
[BOY B] The fireworks
are gonna be awesome!

135
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,750
Now here I am, stuck
touring Kyoto by myself.

136
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,583
[NOZOMI] Hey, what's up,
lil' lady? You a local?

137
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,958
You're a cutie.
So did I fool ya?

138
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,125
What're you doing here?

139
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,541
I thought you went
with the others.

140
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,791
Nope, they're nice and all,

141
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,375
but I decided I just
wanna hang out with you.

142
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,708
I hope that's okay.

143
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,000
Now what? Any ideas where
we should head next?

144
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,791
Huh?

145
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,666
What's the matter, Miyata?

146
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,250
Wow, you play dirty.

147
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,875
You always seem like you're so
oblivious, but it's all an act.

148
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,291
Look! There they are!

149
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,041
We found you! We've been
searching all over for you guys!

150
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,541
[SAYAKA] Seriously? Guess
all my friends play dirty.

151
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,458
Hey, Miyata!

152
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,083
[NON screams]

153
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,250
Ouch! You took a major
tumble! Are you okay, Non?

154
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,041
[NON]
Whaddaya mean? I didn't fall!

155
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,875
I meant to do that, I swear!

156
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,708
I was pretendin' to slide
into base 'cause I'm happy!

157
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,000
[SAYAKA] Sorry, but
nobody's gonna buy that.

158
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,583
Nice try though!

159
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,458
[NON] Anyway, I found a place
that looks like a lot of fun.

160
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,625
You guys wanna check it out?

161
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,125
We can always move
on if it's lame.

162
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,625
[MIKU] I know I said that you
could do whatever you wanted

163
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,125
with your free time,
but come on,

164
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,416
don't you think you might've
gone a tad overboard?

165
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,916
Just look at all that stuff!

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah, maybe.

167
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,458
[MIKU] I'll be confiscating all
of that, thank you very much.

168
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,500
I'll be holding on to your
personal belongings

169
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,875
while you're busy
with training camp.

170
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,041
[NOZOMI]
At least let me eat...

171
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,041
[MIKU] Young lady,
hand it over right now.

172
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,375
Give it to me!

173
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,833
I'll eat it later and
tell you how tasty it was.

174
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,583
[NOZOMI] Aw man, that was
the only souvenir I got.

175
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,916
Listen up, everyone.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,958
Before we arrive,
allow me to explain

177
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,708
what we'll be doing at this
special training camp.

178
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,291
You'll be divided into groups
based on your player type:

179
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,208
Infighter, outfighter,
or counter.

180
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,541
Each group will then be given
a dedicated instructor

181
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,083
who will lead you
through your training.

182
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,458
Basically, they're the boss.

183
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,291
Excuse me. I haven't been
assigned a player type.

184
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,916
Oh, I forgot!

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,208
Ms. Ujibe has a message for you.

186
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,833
For now, she wants you
to train as an infighter.

187
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,666
At least while you're
at this training camp.

188
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,166
So that'll be your group.

189
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,041
I'm an infighter.

190
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,208
[laughs]

191
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,375
[NOZOMI] Now I can
start trainin' in a way

192
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,791
that matches my strengths!

193
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,250
That means you'll be with me!

194
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,916
We're gonna have
some fun, Nozomi!

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,291
Yeah! This is gonna be amazin'!

196
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,500
She's so fired up.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,791
[NOZOMI] Ah. So this is
where we'll be stayin', huh?

198
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,333
It looks pretty nice.

199
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,666
You're right.

200
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,625
I was imaginin' somethin'
a little more run-down.

201
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,666
But this place isn't so bad.

202
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,958
[NOZOMI] I'm tellin' you,
rickshaws are super-fast!

203
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,166
I would know 'cause
I rode on one today!

204
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,333
Huh, whaddaya mean what
am I doin' in Kyoto? Ha!

205
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,541
I'm at a special training
camp along with...

206
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,291
Somethin' about not
havin' a cell phone

207
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,416
makes me wanna talk to
my family a lot more.

208
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,833
I know, right?

209
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,791
It's like all I want
is to hear their voices.

210
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,958
[NOZOMI] ...become a
B-class Keijo player...

211
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,375
[RIN] Kaminashi sure
is taking her time.

212
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,041
[HANABI]
No kidding.

213
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,458
[NOZOMI]
...and win big prize money!

214
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,958
Basically, everything's
goin' great!

215
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,541
[SAYAKA]
Hello, Mom?

216
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,125
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

217
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,458
Is Dad home?

218
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,458
[SAYAKA'S MOM]
Honey! Phone call from Sayaka!

219
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,833
[sighs]

220
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,750
[SAYAKA'S MOM]
Listen, dear. I'm sorry.

221
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,416
No. It's no big deal.

222
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,916
But thanks for trying, Mom.
I'll talk to you later.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,958
[SAYAKA'S MOM]
Hang in there, Sayaka.

224
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,375
[MIKU] For this training camp,
you're going to be rooming

225
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,333
with members of your
player type group.

226
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,041
It makes things easier
when your roommates

227
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,291
are on the same schedule

228
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,541
and allows you to stay
with your instructors.

229
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,166
What a bummer! Sorry,
Miyata, Kazane, and Non.

230
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,541
I'm gonna miss you guys.

231
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,250
[HANABI] C'mon, let's go
check out our room, Nozomi!

232
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,416
We'll miss you too!

233
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,458
I kinda feel sorry for her.

234
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,291
[NOZOMI]
Oh! This room's enormous!

235
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,875
[ATSUKO] If I catch ya in
here again, I'll report ya.

236
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,916
[whines]

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
[USAGI]
I just wanna see my beloved!

238
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,333
Hey, who was that weirdo?

239
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,958
Uh? You've never met her before?

240
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,916
Guess you could say she worships
Kusakai. She's a groupie.

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,041
[chuckles]

242
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,833
[HANABI]
Her name's Usagi Tsukishita

243
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,250
and she's an outfighter
in the elite class.

244
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,416
[HANABI]
She doesn't really stick out,

245
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,208
but I think she's
a cutie, don't you?

246
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,708
Looks like this is my chance.

247
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,125
[chuckles]

248
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,208
Yep, she's tiny and cute
just like a lil' bunny rabbit.

249
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,375
Would you quit fondling
me while you're talking?

250
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,291
[MIO] I can't help it,
they're a perfect handful!

251
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,791
[NOZOMI] You're seriously
creepin' me out!

252
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,291
[HANABI] I wanna fondle them,
too! Can I? Pretty please?

253
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,083
[USAGI] I'll get you for this,
Nozomi Kaminashi!

254
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,666
How dare you steal my beloved
Kusakai's affections from me!

255
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
[NOZOMI whines]

256
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
What're those? Weights?

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah.

258
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,458
I figured I might as well train
my legs while we're out runnin'.

259
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,625
You did that on your own? Wow!

260
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,083
You're way into your training
lately, aren't ya, Kaminashi?

261
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,458
Woohoo! We are seriously
rockin' our run today!

262
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,166
[NOZOMI laughs]

263
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,208
[RIN]
Uh?

264
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,875
Whoa, did you see that?

265
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,416
What'll we do,
Kusakai? I mean...

266
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,833
[NOZOMI, RIN]
...she ran right past us.

267
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,875
[MIO] Let's pick up
the pace and pass her!

268
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,291
Hey, wait!

269
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,041
I don't get why we're runnin'
faster all of a sudden?

270
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,333
We have to!

271
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,708
We're members of the elite class

272
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,000
of Setouchi Keijo
Training Academy!

273
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,208
And we're not about to let

274
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,833
some old lady on her
morning jog pass us by!

275
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,416
Why are they so competitive?

276
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,583
There she is! Look!

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,500
She glared and then went faster!

278
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,000
Uh-huh!

279
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,791
It seems like the old lady's
challenging us, doesn't it?

280
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,125
Sure does! Let's show
her what we can do!

281
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,291
No! We couldn't catch up to her!

282
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,208
[MIKU] What happened?
Why is everyone out of breath?

283
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,458
Well, uh...

284
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,416
Ya see, there was this
really fast old lady.

285
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,125
I'm afraid that
I don't understand.

286
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,875
[NOZOMI] She had a hat
and a towel around-- Uh!

287
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,416
That's her! The old
lady who beat us!

288
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,958
Excuse me? Who're you
calling an old lady?

289
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,500
[NOZOMI]
What're you doing here?

290
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,958
Ya think maybe she's stayin'
at the same inn as we are?

291
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,083
[GIRLS gasp]

292
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,291
Oh no, now what did she do?

293
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,666
It's falling!

294
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,916
[gasps]

295
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,541
Surface-to-Surface Butt Missile!

296
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Sheesh. You kids
have got a lot to learn.

297
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,166
Honestly, you're
inelegant and loud.

298
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,833
And it seems you girls
have absolutely no respect

299
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:58,833
for your elders.

300
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,041
[NOZOMI gasps]

301
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,125
I can't believe she
knocked the lumber away

302
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,500
without a running start!

303
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,875
We've been waiting for you.

304
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,166
This is Ms. Kyouko Shirayuki,
a pro Keijo player.

305
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,250
She's called the
Missile Lady of Kyoto,

306
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,375
and she's currently ranked

307
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,708
as the most popular
player in Honshu.

308
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,291
So that's her.

309
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,333
[NOZOMI]
The Shirokuma Lady of Kyoto!

310
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,791
Missile Lady.

311
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,750
Give me a break, Kobayakawa.

312
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,750
Dontcha think you're layin'
it on a little too thick?

313
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,958
[MIKU chuckles]

314
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,291
You ladies should feel special.

315
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,250
She came back to town
specifically to teach

316
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,750
at this training camp for you.

317
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,583
You came all the way
here just to train us?

318
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,083
Well, thank you, we're honored.

319
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,708
Who knew our instructor would
be an active Keijo player?

320
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,625
[MIKU] I did! I thought
I told you that.

321
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,750
No, you forgot.

322
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,333
I get it now.

323
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,666
I was wondering why we had to
come all the way here to Kyoto.

324
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,250
Well, I dunno about the others,

325
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,750
but I'm stoked to learn from
a pro player like you.

326
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,541
This doesn't happen every day.

327
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,875
It's nice to meet everyone.
Let's train hard.

328
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,000
[GIRLS] Right! Thank you
for teaching us, ma'am.

329
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,375
[NOZOMI]
She's incredible.

330
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,875
It took some serious
butt strength

331
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
to attack the way she did.

332
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,750
She's gotta be crazy strong.

333
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,458
I don't think I could
handle a hit from her.

334
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,541
Well, I'll catch you
ladies tomorrow.

335
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,291
[NOZOMI] Honestly, I think
everybody was in shock.

336
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,791
We'd never been around
an active pro before.

337
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,500
We had no idea they were so
much stronger than us amateurs.

338
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,875
Allow me to introduce you
to the three Keijo pros

339
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,416
you'll be training
with this camp.

340
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,166
Miyo Harada, A-Class player
with the Kyoto Kansai Branch.

341
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,875
I'm happy to say that I'll be
working with the outfighters.

342
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,375
It's nice to meet you all.

343
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm also an A-Class player
with the Kyoto Kansai Branch.

344
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,041
My name is Inoue and I'll be
working with the counters.

345
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,416
Thank you for having me.

346
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,541
I introduced myself
to you yesterday.

347
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,416
I'm Shirayuki, an A-Class player
along with these ladies.

348
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,291
I'll be working
with the infighters.

349
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,833
[NOZOMI] Shirayuki's an
infighter, just like me!

350
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,291
[MIKU]
Now listen up, everyone.

351
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,375
I hope you understand
it's rare for amateurs

352
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,083
to get personal training
from active Keijo players.

353
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,958
Stay focused and listen closely.

354
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,166
You may never get a
chance like this again.

355
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,125
All right, it's time for
you to split into groups

356
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:04,875
and get to work!

357
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,333
[GIRLS]
Right!

358
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,541
Bye, Nozomin! You go kick
infighter butt, okay?

359
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,333
Will do! See ya, Non.

360
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,000
[NOZOMI] I can't believe I get
to train with an active pro.

361
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,916
I wonder if she'll
think I'm any good.

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,291
I'm gonna do my
best to impress her.

363
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,416
Nozomi! The infighters
are headed this way.

364
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,833
[gasps] Coming!

365
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,875
Let's get out there and
show 'em how it's done!

366
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,958
[SHIRAYUKI] So you're
Setouchi's elite infighters?

367
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,416
Nice to meet you.

368
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,375
We'll get started with your
specialized type training

369
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,583
in a minute.

370
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,833
First, there's something
I need to say to you

371
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,708
and I want you
to listen closely.

372
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,958
[ALL]
Hm?

373
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,708
There's nothing I hate
more than dishonesty.

374
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,625
Cheaters won't be tolerated.

375
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,708
If I find out that any of
you are being deceitful,

376
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,875
I will do everything I can to
make sure you never go pro.

377
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,208
Do I make myself clear?

378
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,458
[GIRLS]
Yes!

379
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,333
[NOZOMI] Man, talk about harsh!
She's hardcore!

380
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,708
Kaminashi, let me see
your hands, please.

381
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,208
[NOZOMI]
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,833
Don't you think your nails
are a little long, young lady?

383
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,083
When playing Keijo,
sometimes it's necessary

384
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,500
to use your arms to balance or
build momentum for an attack.

385
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,583
If your nails are too long,
you risk hurting yourself

386
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,750
and your opponent.

387
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,875
It's considered rude
and it's dangerous.

388
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,833
It never even crossed
your mind, did it?

389
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,958
[NOZOMI]
Ah! She's so mean!

390
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
Unacceptable!

391
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,958
Here, let me clip them for you.

392
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,500
[NOZOMI]
And now she's nice!

393
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,625
Wow, you're good at that.

394
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,416
Thanks. Remember to keep
them trimmed from now on.

395
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,875
Hm?

396
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,708
Look at your shirt, Kusakai,
the edges are all frayed!

397
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,583
Unacceptable! Let me
patch it up for you.

398
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,791
Oh. Thank you, ma'am.

399
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,666
[NOZOMI]
When she says "unacceptable,"

400
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,541
she means it's unacceptable
unless she fixes it herself.

401
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Okay.

402
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,583
Now that you girls are
presentable and ready to go,

403
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,291
I would like to get to
know each of you better

404
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,250
and the best way to do
that is... with a race.

405
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,625
Here's what we're going to do:

406
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,166
One at a time you'll come up
to the Land and race me.

407
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,000
As I feel there is
no better way for us

408
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,333
to understand one another.

409
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,708
[NOZOMI]
It's happenin'!

410
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,333
It's only the first day
and I get to test my skills

411
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,500
against a pro!

412
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,916
I can't wait to show
her how strong I am!

413
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,791
Nozomi Kaminashi.

414
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,041
I'd like to thank you
for this opportunity.

415
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm ready when you are, ma'am!

416
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,291
[gasps]

417
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,708
C'mon, don't you know better

418
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,291
than to throw your
shirt into the river?

419
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,625
[NOZOMI]
Uh! Oh, sorry about that.

420
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,041
[SHIRAYUKI] Hey, Kawai?
Would you be our time-keeper?

421
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,125
[HANABI]
Sure!

422
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,541
[NOZOMI]
She's intense.

423
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,958
You can tell she's
an active player,

424
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,833
'cause of her
commanding presence.

425
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,833
And her cute swimsuit, too.

426
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,750
Here we go!
Time to start the race!

427
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,166
Well, I suppose we
should get started.

428
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,875
Remember, no holding back.

429
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,125
Give me all you've got.

430
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,333
Yep, That's what
I was plannin' to do!

431
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,750
You're a fast one.

432
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,750
She dodged it so easily!
What about this?

433
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,958
[NOZOMI]
She's not retaliatin'!

434
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,416
I'll just have to
keep instigatin'

435
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,541
till ya finally strike back!

436
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,833
[MIO gasps]

437
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,458
She spun on her pivot leg
so she could attack twice!

438
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,875
That's crazy! Where did she
learn a combo like that?

439
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,416
[NOZOMI] Boobs? No way! How'd
her knockers get in my face?

440
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,708
She's been hit!

441
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,250
No. That's not the case.

442
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,625
Shirayuki was just standing
there when Nozomi turned around.

443
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,875
[NOZOMI]
Damn it! How'd she do that?

444
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,375
Just when I thought I was movin'
a lot faster thanks to the UTM.

445
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,083
It's almost as if she knew
where I was gonna move.

446
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,791
This is hard to watch.
She's toying with Nozomi.

447
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
One minute left!

448
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,500
[NOZOMI]
What is the deal?

449
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,083
I was attackin' with
all my strength

450
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,416
and I couldn't touch her.

451
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,375
She's not even out of breath!

452
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,291
So this is the difference
between an amateur and a pro.

453
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,625
[NOZOMI]
Fine. I won't give up yet!

454
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,125
I've seen that build-up.

455
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,500
The Vacuum Butt Cannon!

456
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,916
[NOZOMI] I'm determined to
go pro when I graduate!

457
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,625
I've gotta prove that
I'll be ready to fight

458
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,541
in the big leagues
in six months.

459
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,250
I won't let this end
without landin' a hit!

460
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,875

461
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,291
[NOZOMI]
I'm outta space to get momentum!

462
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,625
You've got amazing core
strength, yet your body's soft,

463
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,000
and you use your flexibility
to your advantage.

464
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,791
You aren't afraid to go up
against a strong opponent.

465
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,541
These are all
impressive qualities.

466
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,458
[NOZOMI] Crap! I stopped too
fast and lost my balance!

467
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,833
[SHIRAYUKI] And that's what
makes this such a shame.

468
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
[HANABI] No way! Only one hit?

469
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,791
She struck right in
the middle of her butt!

470
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,250
[NOZOMI]
I've never felt so much power.

471
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,708
She threw me off the Land
like I was a friggin' ragdoll.

472
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,916
[NOZOMI]
I fought hard,

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and I still couldn't even get
close enough to touch her.

474
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,791
Active pros are tougher
than I thought.

475
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,333
[SHIRAYUKI] I know you're
probably disappointed,

476
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,750
but you need to understand
that you have a weak point.

477
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,375
It may be your body's
greatest flaw.

478
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,000
Whaddaya mean? What
kinda weak point is it?

479
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,250
Wait, you don't know?

480
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,166
You've got to be more
aware of your own body.

481
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,583
[gasps]

482
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,041
You need to know
your weaknesses

483
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,416
so that you can overcome them.

484
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,208
Believe me when I say
that's the only way

485
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,708
for you to become a
stronger Keijo player.

486
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,250
If you don't listen to your body
and figure out what its lacking,

487
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,041
your butt will never
be able to touch me,

488
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:39,000
or any other pro Keijo
players for that matter.

489
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,000
Now then, who wants
to race me next?

490
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,041
[NOZOMI]
I don't understand.

491
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,625
My body's flawed?
But how can that be?

492
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,250
[SAYAKA grunting]

493
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,250
[SAYAKA] Goodness, this thing's
even tighter than I thought.

494
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,791
But it makes my boobs look big.

495
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,291
They're not giant, but
they're bigger than normal.

496
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,458
You like my bosoms, boys?
They're so bouncy!

497
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,041
Um. No, they are not.

498
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,125
[SAYAKA yelps]

499
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,041
[NON, KAZANE]
Not at all.

500
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,541
[SAYAKA cries]

501
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,000
[NOZOMI] Next Time:
"Where the Turnips Lead!"
