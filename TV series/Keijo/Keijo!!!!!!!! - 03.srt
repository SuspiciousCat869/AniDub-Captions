1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,000
[NARRATOR] In the past,
gamblers have been limited

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,541
to horse, bike, boat,
and car races,

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,791
but now there's a new form
of legalized gambling

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:15,958
sweeping the nation.

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,000
It's called Keijo!

6
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,041
Players compete to be
the last girl standing

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,583
atop a floating platform
called a "Land."

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,625
The kicker? They can only
use their boobs and butts!

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,125
The question is:
Who will rule the Land?

10
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,083
Will it be the 18-year-old
Nozomi Kaminashi?

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,416
She's one of the
many young ladies

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,416
whose search for fame
and fortune has lead them

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,333
to the world of Keijo!

14
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,708
And this is the story of their
journey to becoming champions!

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,000
Take this!

16
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,583
[gasps]

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,625
[ALL gasp]

18
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,666
[ALL scream]

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,458
No way.

20
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,916
Whoa. What happened?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,458
But how did she?

22
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,916
[NON screams]

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,875
Hey, Nozomin! What
has gotten into you?

24
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,375
[NOZOMI]
My hips hurt... real bad.

25
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,666
[HITOMI]
Medics!

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,666
[NOZOMI groaning]

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,166
[NOZOMI]
Why does it hurt so much?

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,291
[NON]
Nozomin!

29
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,625
Are you okay?

30
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,541
Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine.

31
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,666
[chuckles]

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,500
The way that she
twisted her hips.

33
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,875
Impossible.

34
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,291
She's only been at Setouchi
for a couple of months.

35
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,541
She couldn't pull it off.

36
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,875
You'd think. But there's
no denying what we saw.

37
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,916
[NON] I hope Nozomin's not
seriously hurt or anything.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,458
Me too.

39
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,750
I'm kinda worried since she
didn't make it back to class.

40
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,958
[NOZOMI groaning]

41
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,875
[NOZOMI]
Aw, man, that feels so good!

42
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,125
I can't thank you
enough, Kazane.

43
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,625
[NON]
You're back!

44
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,000
Yep, and I feel a lot better

45
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
after gettin' that
amazin' massage.

46
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,875
That's good to hear!

47
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,958
So what'd I miss in
the lecture today?

48
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,916
We learned about the
different classifications

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,125
of Keijo players.

50
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,750
[NOZOMI]
Okay...

51
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,708
They fall into one
of three categories

52
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,125
based on their fighting style.

53
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,958
What three categories?

54
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,250
[SAYAKA]
First, there's the "infighter,"

55
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,916
who excels at close
range attacks

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,333
and relies on pure strength.

57
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,916
[NOZOMI]
Interesting.

58
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,000
[SAYAKA] Second,
there's the "outfighter,"

59
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,875
who likes to keep their distance
and uses speed to strike.

60
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,333
[NOZOMI]
Makes sense.

61
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,083
[SAYAKA]
And the third is the "counter."

62
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,875
They use their opponent's
attacks and strength

63
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,166
against them in order
to secure a win.

64
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,000
[NOZOMI]
Oh, wow.

65
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,333
If that's the case,

66
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,375
I guess you'd be considered
an outfighter, huh?

67
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,375
I mean, you're pretty fast.

68
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,958
Most likely.

69
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm usually much quicker
than my opponent

70
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,833
so that may be the
best tactic for me.

71
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,291
Should be the perfect
fit for... my butt attacks.

72
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,583
Most def! That Butt
Gatling you did was crazy!

73
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,958
It would've knocked out
anybody other than Ms. Ujibe.

74
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,708
I've never seen
someone move so fast.

75
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,500
I've always been
proud of my speed.

76
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,000
It was one of my
strengths in Judo.

77
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,833
I believe it. You never stay
in one place for very long.

78
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,583
Talk about an annoyin' opponent.

79
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,916
What did you just call me?

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,750
Now, now, calm down.
Here's an idea.

81
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,958
Let's hurry and get dressed

82
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,000
so we can go pick up
our brand new swimsuits!

83
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,166
That reminds me. Thanks
for ruining our old ones.

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,833
Huh? You can't
blame me for that!

85
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,083
You guys prob'ly popped 'em

86
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,708
'cause you gained a ton
of weight or somethin'!

87
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,125
Yeah.

88
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,500
Like we're going
to put on weight

89
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,958
when we're in physical
training all day, every day.

90
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,708
[NOZOMI]
How else would you explain it?

91
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,166
[HANABI] You used the air
to slice through them.

92
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,166
[NOZOMI]
Oh, hey! What's with the robes?

93
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,666
One of the elite class
perks are spa treatments.

94
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,916
No fair!

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,250
It's amazing what the
spa does for your skin.

96
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,875
Here, let me show you.

97
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,833
Touch my neck. You won't believe
how soft and smooth it feels.

98
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,583
No thanks. I 'm good.

99
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,291
Cut it out, Kusakai.

100
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,208
You're making
Nozomi uncomfortable.

101
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,583
Fine!

102
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,750
I heard that you were taken
to the infirmary today.

103
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,333
So are you feeling all right?

104
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,875
Yeah, Kazane just gave me
an exhilarating massage.

105
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,041
I'm back to full strength.

106
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,541
Oh, wow, really?

107
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,875
Massage is awesome, but
pressure points can help, too.

108
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,083
Yeah?

109
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,750
[HANABI]
Definitely. Let me show you.

110
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,541
[screams]

111
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,625
Holy moley!

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,375
Whoa! My body feels lighter!

113
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,583
For real! That worked wonders!

114
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,250
Uh. Hey, Kawai.

115
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,291
What were you
talking about before?

116
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,458
[HANABI] Oh, yeah! I know why
your swimsuits ripped apart.

117
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,416
It was a Vacuum
Butt Cannon, right?

118
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,875
I don't know what
you're saying.

119
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,791
So you did it without
even knowing what it was?

120
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,541
It's a Keijo technique
that combines

121
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,583
powerful rotational energy
and a sharp twist of the hips.

122
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,125
It allows the player to
slash through the air.

123
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,791
[NOZOMI] Gee, I didn't
know I had it in me.

124
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,125
It's such a difficult move
that there are pro players

125
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,125
who've never been
able to master it.

126
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,250
Using your butt to
rip through the air...

127
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,250
The Vacuum Butt
Cannon's a big deal.

128
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,791
Anyone who mastered the move
has become a prize queen.

129
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,458
[NOZOMI]
A prize queen? Oh yeah!

130
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,833
I could move into a fancy
high-rise, drive a luxury car,

131
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,625
and eat like a friggin' king!

132
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,000
I've made up my mind!

133
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,041
I'm gonna make it
my signature move!

134
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,750
If you ask me, you're way too
talented for the regular class.

135
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,291
[ALL]
Huh?

136
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,083
Hello, ladies. I'm the fastest
outfighter in Western Japan.

137
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,291
Rin Rokudo.

138
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,041
Nice to meet ya.

139
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,666
I seriously doubt that you're
the fastest, but whatever.

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,291
[HANABI] Miss Rokudo's in
the elite class with us.

141
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,375
Yeah, and she's a weird one.
She's kinda full of herself.

142
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,208
Cute though. She reminds
me of a little kitten.

143
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,958
That's why I've
nicknamed her Rin-rin.

144
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,916
Uh! Hey, I told you to
stop calling me that!

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,458
Rin-rin, you said that you
were an outfighter, right?

146
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,375
[RIN] Ugh, please do not
use that stupid nickname.

147
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,083
If you're the fastest
in Western Japan,

148
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,000
let's see what you've got.

149
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,083
[chuckles]

150
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,958
[RIN]
Okay, try and count my attacks.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,500
[RIN]
Well? How many did you count?

152
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,416
I'd go ahead and round up.

153
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,291
[NOZOMI] She's so fast,
I couldn't even see them.

154
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,125
And the answer is--

155
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,041
[NOZOMI]
She disappeared!

156
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,458
[NON screams]

157
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,375
A total of 30 thrusts.

158
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,625
[NON screams]

159
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,750
How'd she get over
there so quickly?

160
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,166
I dunno.

161
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,625
Now do you believe
that I'm the fastest?

162
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,625
Rin-rin. It's no fair. Why do
you always hog all the fun?

163
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,416
When it comes to speed,
nobody can match me.

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,291
I leave 'em all behind.

165
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,875
[NON screaming]

166
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,458
Oops! My bad!

167
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,375
[HANABI] Now you've don't it,
Rin-rin! You've gone too far!

168
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,625
Y'know, you're wasting
your time, Kaminashi.

169
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,000
You'd be better off training
with the elite class.

170
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,333
What?

171
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's be real, you've got
serious Keijo potential.

172
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,416
But you're not gonna grow

173
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,583
as long as you're training
with your weak roommates.

174
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,916
Who're you calling "weak"?

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
Hey now, our class has
some pretty good players.

176
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,750
We do.

177
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,291
But you're the only decent
fighter in the regular class.

178
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,625
The others are lame and none
of them even come close

179
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,041
to being in my league
as an outfighter.

180
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,500
You might as well train
with your new BFFs.

181
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,958
You know you're gonna
ditch these losers

182
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,750
and join us in elite.

183
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,125
What're you talking about?

184
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,125
[RIN]
Wait. You haven't heard?

185
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,541
There's an event coming that's
going to shake things up.

186
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,958
It'll be fun for us, but maybe
not so much for your roommates.

187
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,000
An event, huh?

188
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,625
[RIN]
Yep, the class-change race.

189
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,708
It's time for us to get
back to our rooms, ladies.

190
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,083
Take care! See you soon, Nozomi!

191
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,625
[MIO]
Quit pushing!

192
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,000
Wow.

193
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,166
I can't decide whether
she's confident or arrogant.

194
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,541
I'd say both.

195
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,833
I dunno how I feel about
a "class-change race."

196
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,916
I'm happy to stay
where I am now.

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,875
What do you think, Miyata?

198
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,208
I think you're lucky.

199
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,833
You've got members
of the elite class

200
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,416
practically begging you
to train with them.

201
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,333
Why is she upset?

202
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,875
So she thinks she's
the fastest outfighter?

203
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,958
[HITOMI] Next up,
Momo Horiuchi. Outfighter.

204
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,166
[MOMO]
Right!

205
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,791
[HITOMI] And last but
not least, room 309.

206
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,958
Miyata: Outfighter.
Toyoguchi: Counter.

207
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,458
Aoba: Outfighter.

208
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,750
[SAYAKA, NON, KAZANE]
Right!

209
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,583
[HITOMI]
Kaminashi.

210
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,041
Yes, ma'am?

211
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,083
I cannot assign you yet.

212
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,916
Ms. Ujibe would like to
have a word with you.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,833
Please head to the staff room.

214
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,875
Tell me.

215
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,625
Have you ever heard
of a Keijo technique

216
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,250
called the Vacuum Butt Cannon?

217
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,458
Uh, well yeah.

218
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,916
I've been told that's the move

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,125
I accidentally used against
you during the mock race.

220
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,875
I see. Guess word
travels fast.

221
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,458
That fact that you could
pull it off is impressive.

222
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,458
Even if it was by sheer luck.

223
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,666
It'd be a powerful weapon
if you mastered it.

224
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,333
One that could propel you
to Keijo superstardom.

225
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,416
You really think so?

226
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
[NAGISA]
I know so.

227
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,000
Every woman who's mastered that
technique and used it in races

228
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,375
has gone on to become
a prize queen.

229
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,875
Oh, yeah! Show me the money!

230
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,750
[NAGISA]
Kaminashi.

231
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,458
Listen. I forbid you from
using that technique again.

232
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,708
Do wha--?

233
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,416
[NAGISA]
Did you hear what I just said?

234
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,875
Well, yeah. I heard the part
about becoming a prize queen.

235
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,208
I said I forbid you from
using that technique!

236
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,750
But I don't understand.

237
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,000
If it could launch my Keijo
career, then why can't I use it?

238
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,458
There's too much risk involved.

239
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,541
I want our students to have
long and healthy careers.

240
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,875
But that move could
make me a prize queen.

241
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,083
[NAGISA] You know what happened
to the women who used it?

242
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,250
They damaged their hips

243
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,750
and were forced into
an early retirement.

244
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,291
The technique
requires the player

245
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,916
to create rotational energy
by violently spinning

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,166
and then swinging
their hips like a whip.

247
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,250
When performed,
it puts incredible strain

248
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,375
on the hips and
surrounding joints.

249
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,000
Most professional
players avoid it

250
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,916
'cause they're afraid
of hurting themselves.

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,541
And you're still a novice.

252
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,125
If you're not careful, you could
irreparably damage your hips,

253
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,625
then you'll never
be able to go pro.

254
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,000
One false move and
your career's over.

255
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, but still--!

256
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,333
[NAGISA]
I'm warning you.

257
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,000
If you insist on trying
to master this technique,

258
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,166
you'll be expelled
from Setouchi.

259
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,083
[NOZOMI gasps]

260
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,291
Conversation's over.

261
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,958
[NOZOMI]
Wait! Hear me out first!

262
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,875
[NAGISA]
I'm listening.

263
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,625
I didn't decide to
come to Setouchi

264
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,291
just so I could get
enough training to go pro.

265
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,791
If I'm gonna play Keijo,
then I wanna be the best at it.

266
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,666
And I wanna win!

267
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,666
I don't ever wanna go through
the pain of losin' again.

268
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,666
If I can master a technique,
one that makes me a prize queen,

269
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,166
then I'm gonna!

270
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,250
I like it here. I'm learnin'
all sorts of stuff.

271
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,125
But I wanna at least
give it a shot!

272
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,291
At this school, we take pride
in training Keijo players.

273
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,041
We're not going to
allow our students

274
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,916
to needlessly risk
their careers.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
I understand that.

276
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,750
And I know I risk
hurting myself,

277
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,666
but that'll just make
me practice more!

278
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,333
[NOZOMI]
I'm begging you.

279
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,416
Teach me the Vacuum Butt Cannon.

280
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:35,125
What is it about that technique?

281
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,083
You do realize there
are plenty of others

282
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,166
that don't come with the risk.

283
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,000
I wanna learn the
Vacuum Butt Cannon

284
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,125
'cause I know it'll
make me a prize queen.

285
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,500
Sometimes knowing when to give
up is the strongest move of all.

286
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,208
Look, I get what
you're sayin'...

287
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,791
...but there's no way
I'm gonna give up,

288
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,500
not when there's so
much on the line!

289
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,250
I hafta prove myself!

290
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,500
Very well then.

291
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,958
I'll help you master
the technique,

292
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,833
but you're not gonna like it.

293
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,791
I want you to wear this
suit every day for a month.

294
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,708
Whoa, that's weird lookin'.

295
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,666
Is it cosplay?

296
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,750
Don't mock my training.

297
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,375
Okay. So I seriously
have to wear this?

298
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,333
If you wanna learn
the Vacuum Butt Cannon.

299
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,333
Are you giving up before
we even get started?

300
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,791
No, I'll wear it!

that crazy get up?

I-It's pulling on my body.

00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,666

Oh my. It kinda looks
like a racing suit.

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,958
It's called a UTM.

And what does that stand for?

310

It's Ujibe's Training Maillot.

You look dumb.

Hey, don't say that!
I already know, okay!

[HANA]
What's with the unitard?

317
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,625
[HARUMI] Rumor has it
she pissed off Ms. Ujibe,

318
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,666
and wearing that's
her punishment.

319

[screams]

320
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,916
[HARUMI] Ugh. Looks like
a pain in the butt.

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,458
[HANA] Yeah, I kinda
feel bad for her.

322
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,833
It's hard to even
walk in this suit.

323
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,583
How'm I supposed to get
anything done like this?

324
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,958
It's pullin' against me.

325
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,708
Gotta tense my muscles
or I'm done for!

326
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,416
I can barely move...

Nozomin!

329
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,666
I can't swim in this thing?!

330
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,708
What the heck? A swimsuit
that makes you drown?

331
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,625
Now I've seen everything.

332
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,708
Bet this is some kinda test.

333
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,291
I'm gonna pass
with flyin' colors

334
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,875
and make the Vacuum
Butt Cannon mine!

335
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,958
[HITOMI] Move it, Kaminashi,
you're in the way!

336
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000
If you wanna train,
do it poolside!

337
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,750
[NOZOMI] Sorry!

338
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,958
I'm too slow.
I've gotta move faster.

339

This is hard, but there's
no way that I'm givin' up!

347
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,875
I'll make the Vacuum Butt
Cannon my signature move!

348
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:45,791
[SAYAKA] It's still not
enough. I need to go faster.

349
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,333
I won't lose to her!

350
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,291
Aoba, why are you
reaching for her butt?

351
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,625
[KAZANE yelping]

352
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,583
Oh, wow! Really?
That sounds amazing!

353
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,416
In that case, I'll help you
touch as many butts as possible!

354
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,375
If you've got sore
muscles from training,

355
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,500
then come get a
massage from Aoba!

356
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,791
You'll love it, trust me!

[NON]
Would you like a massage?

359
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,833
She's a great masseuse.

360
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,833
And the best part about it
is it's free of charge!

361
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,833
[YUKO] Oh wow,
you've got magic fingers!

362
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,250
[NON] Okay, everyone, line up
and we'll be with you shortly.

[GIRL B sighs]

364
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,958
[GIRL B] Oh, yeah. This is
exactly what I needed.

365
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,000
[NON]
If you like your massage,

366
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,791
be sure to tell
all your friends!

367
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,708
See? Now you'll be able
to get data on everybody!

368
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,166
[GIRL B] I can't get over
how good this feels!

369
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,833
It feels like my entire
body's being compressed.

370
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,208
And it makes my
training much harder.

371
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,750
Ugh! This rubber's too tight.

372
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,250
If it's that uncomfortable
then tell Ms. Ujibe.

373
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,541
[NOZOMI]
And admit defeat?

374
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,125
No, I can handle it,

375
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,375
but I could move faster if it
covered a smaller surface area.

376
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,083
[SAYAKA]
Smaller surface area? Faster?

377
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,541
That's it!

378
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,833
[NOZOMI groans]

379
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,166
Kaminashi. You're too tense.
Try to loosen up.

380
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,916
Easier said than done
when you do what I'm doing.

381
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,500
But If your muscles
are all tensed up,

382
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,458
they're not gonna work
as well as they should.

383
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,500
You need to learn to relax them.

384
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,750
Guess it couldn't hurt to try.

385

[NOZOMI inhaling, exhaling]

386
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,791
[NOZOMI]
That's the trick!

387
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,583
When I relax, it makes
my whole body flexible

388
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,666
and I can move with
no problem at all!

389
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,916
I finally figured it out!

390
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,541
Still not enough.

391
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,125
[yells]

392
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,625
This'll work. I know it will.

00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,125
What the heck? Ugh!

394
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,625
The suit feels like it's even
tighter than it was before.

00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,458
Sheesh!

396
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,750

Nozomin! Nozomin!

00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,791
Yeah, what's up?

398
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,208
The teachers just
put up the info

399
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,875
about the
class-change race!

Oh, really?
So the time has come.

I can't wait for them to see
how strong my butt is now!

[NAGISA]
It's been three months

403
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,916
since you ladies first
joined Setouchi's ranks.

404
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,250
You've trained hard and
studied form and technique

405
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,000
in order to improve the strength
and agility of your butts.

406
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,500
I'm sure you're wondering
if you've become stronger.

407
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, today we're
going to find out

408
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,875
as you compete in your
first class-change race.

409
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,750
I hope you aren't too attached
to your current classes.

410
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,083
I've got a feeling this race
is gonna switch things up!

411
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,583
[NOZOMI] Why'd they put an elite
class member in each group?

412
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,125
[SAYAKA]
Because that's how you advance.

413
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,125
Someone from the regular
class can't move up

414
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,208
unless they defeat an elite.

415
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:50,458
[NOZOMI] Kotone Fujisaki. I've
never seen her fight before.

00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,875
[RIN]
Aw, man, what a bummer!

417
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,541
I was hopin' I'd get
to race against you.

418
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,041
There's no one else
in the regular class

419
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,583
who can keep up with me.

420
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,833
This is gonna be way too easy.

421
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,166
[NOZOMI]
We've got some amazin' players!

Yeah. Whatever you say.

423
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,125
But even if you did,

424
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,000
they wouldn't stand
a chance against me.

425

not true. There's plenty--

to anyone, does she?

[NAGISA]
Let's go over the rules.

435
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,666
You'll be competing against
three other students

436
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,708
and the race will
last five minutes.

437
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,041
As usual, the last person
standing on the Land

438
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,625
is the winner.

439
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,791
You'll draw to determine which
kind of Land you'll be using.

440
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,333
Who wants to do
the honors, ladies?

441
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,708
[MIKU] The first group will
compete on a Seesaw-Style Land.

442
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,458
[SAYAKA]
Oh, boy.

443
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,458
[MIKU] The race will
begin in five minutes.

444
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,083
[NOZOMI]
It doesn't look any different

445
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,583
than a Basic Land to me.

446
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,416
Ya think it's got a special
trick to it or somethin'?

447
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,916
[SAYAKA]
I don't know.

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,125
But I'll find out soon enough.

449
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,333
[NOZOMI]
I'm sorry about before.

450
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,416
I should've told Rin
how good you are.

451
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,416
Guess I just wasn't thinkin'.

452
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,750
No big deal. I'll surprise her.

Five seconds to start.
