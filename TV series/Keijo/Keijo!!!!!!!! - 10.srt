All I have to do

00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,833
is touch someone's behind

all their butt techniques.

behind all your power!

It comes from twisting

00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,541
It's official, folks.
Suruga is our winner!

467
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,875
That's the end
of the second round,

468
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,333
ladies and gentlemen.

469
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,625
Gotta give it to Setouchi--
they may be the underdog,

470
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,291
but they're giving it
their all. What a race!

471
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,833
This one is sure to go down
in the Keijo history books!

472
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,791
[HIKARI]
Do you ladies like magic?

473
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,416
'Cause I've got
a supreme illusion

474
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,875
that I'm simply
dying to show you!

475
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,625
For real? You're gonna
do a trick for us?

476
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,875
Yeah. Watch this.

477
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,958
I'll unleash
my Bust Power! Haaa!

478
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,500
[RIN]
No way!

479
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,875
