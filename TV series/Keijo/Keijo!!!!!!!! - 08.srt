Sweet, I'm ready to do this!

Do your best out there
and you're sure to win.

13
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,625
I got no clue what I did
to make her hate me so much.

00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,333
I'm dying to see
what that turnip pulling

training's done for you, Nozomi.

Yeah, you and me both.

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,500
Guess my hint came in handy
since you figured it out.

18
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,416
It did! I gotta
thank you 'cause I--

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,375
Usagi, I'm sure you've
learned a few tricks

20
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,208
during this training
camp too, right?

21
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,041
Show me your stuff!

22
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,750
Okay, sure.

23
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,750
Anything for you.

24
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,166
Are you obsessed with her?

25
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,791
[USAGI] Why is that
a bad thing? I'm not crazy.

26
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,708
I just really look up
to her, that's all.

27
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,000
In my opinion,
Kusakai's a goddess.

28
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,500
A goddess?

29
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,333
[USAGI] I had to race against
her in the entrance exams

30
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,083
and she kicked my butt.

31
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,291
I was no match for her.
But then, that's when I realized

32
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,041
she's like the goddess Athena.

33
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,125
She's the person I aspire to be!

34
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,583
Her very existence is my oasis
in the desert of life!

35
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,750
[USAGI]
Aaaah! My goddess, Kusakai!

36
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,250
Damn, she's really spillin'
her heart out, ain't she?

37
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,833
One thing's for sure,
Mio. You're loved.

38
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,416
[USAGI]
I had her undivided attention

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,083
until you moved up to elite.

40
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,041
You're not even that
great of a Keijo player,

41
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,750
but she's always
got her eye on you.

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,041
Not to mention her hands!

[growls]

44
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,208
Lemme guess, that's why
you don't like me?

45
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,166
Damn straight! I'm gonna
show her you have nothing on me!

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,375
Only I'm worthy
of her adoration!

47
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,083
It's not like I asked
for her adoration, you know.

48
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,833
But whatever.

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:40,375
If you wanna race,
I'll give ya a good one!

50
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,416
Then bring it on!
You're about to lose big time!

51
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,875
She's fast!

52
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,750
Ugh! She dodged me!

53
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,125
You can't beat me,

54
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,416
'cause I'm fighting to
fulfill my purpose in life.

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,333
I want my goddess to
fawn over me instead of you!

Heh. Your butt is so big
and your attacks are so slow,

60
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,291
there's no way
you'll ever touch me.

61

I'd watch what I say
if I were you.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,375
I learned a few tricks
at this training camp

63
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,541
that just might prove you wrong.

64
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,000
You can do it, Kaminashi.

65
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,125
Show the girls what you learned
in that turnip field.

[NOZOMI grunts]

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,041
[USAGI] It's pointless.
A big butt like yours

69
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
will never be fast
enough to hit me!

That was just a lucky hit! Uh!

until you start pissin' me off.

My butt may be big
but it's fast, too!

77
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,916
What's up with these attacks?
I thought she was slow!

underestimated you a little bit.

that doesn't explain...

How'd Usagi do that crazy move?

00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,500
I dunno. Somehow she
changed course midair,

86
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,625
but Nozomi wasn't pulled along.

87
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,375
Now I get it. You're using
your size against me.

88
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,166
Took ya long enough
to figure it out.

89
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,666
But now you know my petite size
is my greatest physical asset.

90
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,250
What is that supposed to mean?

91
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,500
Simple. She's a
small girl, right?

92
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,208
In a confined space,
like a Land,

93
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,666
being small and light on
your feet can prove useful.

94
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,250
It makes it easier to dodge
and regain balance.

95
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,833
And the smaller the target,
the harder it is to hit.

96
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,125
We'll have to wait and see.

97
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,125
Nozomi's not goin'
down without a fight.

98

There you go, Kaminashi.

99
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,916
You need to take
your butt to the limit.

No, she only grazed her.

When you're as petite as I am,

you can dodge nearly any attack.

stopped right above me.

into another move
was impressive enough,

00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,291
It's sneakin' up on us.

161
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,208
I'm excited but
I'm kinda scared.

162
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,958
I mean, the East-West War
is a major event.

163
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,583
It takes place
in Shizuoka, doesn't it?

164
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah. At the
Shimizu Keijo Arena--

165
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,666
the largest in the country.

166
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,333
What's crazy is it nearly
sells out every year.

167
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,250
And we're the away team,
so that crowd

168
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,916
is gonna boo us bad.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,125
Just thinking about it
makes my heart race.

170
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,875
It's exhilarating, y'know?

171
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,833
What if all of the hot guys
there end up falling for us?

172
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,916
Ah! I can't handle it!

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,666
[GIRLS chattering]

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,708
I have a good feeling
this will be our year.

175
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,541
I certainly hope so.

176
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,000
[sighs]

177
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,125
Hey, check it out, Miyata.

178
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,375
You can see
Mount Fuji from here!

179
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,458
[gasps] So, this is
the Shimizu Keijo Arena!

180
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,416
I never imagined I'd
get the chance to compete

181
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,625
in a big stadium like this!

182
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,708
Great. Now I'm scared.

183
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't be scared, Aoba.
This is gonna be awesome.

184
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,541
This is our chance to show
the Easterners who's boss.

185
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,541
[KAZANE] Who're they?
Are those Suruga students?

186
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,791
[NON]
Yeah and they look strong.

187
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,500
They've got nicer grounds
and better equipment than we do.

188
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,875
Yeah, no kiddin'. Why do
they get to practice here

189
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,750
while we're stuck
in the crummy area?

190
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,500
Aw, man! It looks
like they even train

191
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,458
with personal coaches.

192
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,291
[HANABI] And they have a drink
station! They're so lucky.

193
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,375
[ATSUKO] They must have
some serious sponsors.

194
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,250
Well, that's one thing the East
has on us: loads of cash.

195
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,750
This blows.

196
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,375
That just ain't fair!

197
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,208
[MIKU] Now, now,
that's enough, ladies!

198
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,750
A fancy practice area,
sponsorships, and media

199
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,250
attention are nice but
they're not necessary to win.

200
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
You know what is? Training!

201
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,583
So stop whining
and get back to it!

202
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,083
[ALL groan]

203
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,041
Come on, you want
to win, don't you?

204
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,916
--Then give it your all!
--[ALL] Yes, ma'am.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,125
[AYAKO] The East-West War
is nothing but a joke.

206
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,083
Personally, I think it's time
we put an end to this farce.

207
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,666
[MALE REPORTER 8A]
Would you care to explain?

208
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,875
[AYAKO] In my opinion,
there's no need

209
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,833
for two Keijo training schools;

210
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,833
the West should be
merged with the East.

211
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,625
Setouchi has produced a lot of
mediocre talent who have,

212
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,166
quite honestly,
ruined this wonderful sport.

213
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,875
We know that most of the top
tier players come from the East,

214
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,750
but don't you think you're being
a little too hard on Setouchi?

215
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,166
[AYAKO] Not at all, the results
of the East-West War

216
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,083
have been the same
for the last decade.

217
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,541
Suruga has won the event
every single year.

218
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,708
Setouchi has never
defeated our talent.

219
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,625
What? We've never won?
Is that true?

220
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,791
If we were losing every year
I'd stop competing.

221
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,291
I mean, why put your students
through the heartbreak?

222
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,875
I can't believe
Setouchi's never won.

223
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,458
I know, me either.

224
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,291
You may be in for a surprise
because the players

225
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,166
from the West
are pretty good this year.

226
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,375
Shut up. Don't run
your mouth, moron!

227
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,750
[chuckles] I'm sure
they have some good talent.

228
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,333
However, those girls will never

229
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,541
reach their full potential
at that school.

230
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,583
And that's because
of the teachers.

231
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,375
It's been proven
time and time again

232
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,875
that weak teachers
only produce weak students.

233
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,166
[grunts]

234
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,750
I implore the Keijo
committee to make

235
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,125
a swift decision
regarding this matter.

236
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,666
[clanging]

237
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,000
I was tryin' to ignore ya,
but I couldn't anymore.

238
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,416
Why do you hate
Setouchi so much, lady?

239
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,791
Oh hey, Kaminashi!
I haven't seen you in a while!

240
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,208
--How's it go--
--Think before you speak!

241
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,125
Girls, what're you
doing over there?

242
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,458
Get back here!

243
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,208
You're Setouchi students?

244
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,000
[MIO] You insulted our teachers.
We can't let that slide.

245
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,000
Can't you read? The sign says,
"No outsiders allowed."

246
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,291
[NOZOMI] You think
some sign's gonna stop us?

247
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,791
Our teachers
are wonderful women

248
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,041
who care about their
students and their careers.

249
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,625
Better take back what you said.

250
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,458
She's right; take it back!

251
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,208
[MAYA]
That's enough. I'm warning you,

252
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,750
if you don't leave
our instructor alone

253
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,875
you're in trouble. Got it?

254
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,541
[NOZOMI] Who in the heck is this
girl? A player from the East?

255
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,041
[MAYA] She has the right
to speak her mind without

256
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,916
you and your friends
harassing her.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Go back to your training area.
But first, I suggest

258
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,541
you apologize to her
for trespassing...

259
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,166
...and being disrespect-able!

260
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,916
I don't think...
that's the right word.

261
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
[SAYAKA] Perhaps she meant
to say "disrespectful"?

262
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,208
You're who's
bein' disrespectable!

263
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,583
More like a disrespectincompoop!

264
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,916
Anyway, she needs to take back
what she said right now!

265
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,375
[MAYA] Did you not
hear me the first time?

266
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,083
I told you to back off.

267
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,750
[NOZOMI groans]

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,583
[NOZOMI] How'd she throw me
back with that tiny body?

269
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,375
She didn't even need to wind up!

270
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,041
What's the deal with this girl?

271
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,833
I believe that
I've made myself clear.

272
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,166
If I were you, I would leave
before I get seriously hurt.

273
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,375
If you continue to harass--

274
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,666
Watch it.
Don't underestimate us.

275
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,875
Setouchi'll thrash ya!

276
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,791
Well, that was an interesting
technique you used.

277
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,541
You wouldn't mind showing it
to me again, would you?

278
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,375
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

279
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,458
[NOZOMI] My body's so numb
after that, I can't move.

280
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,000
A Sandstorm?

281
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,958
You better not
touch Nozomi again.

282
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,291
Otherwise, this tiny
spat'll turn into a brawl.

283
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,583
[KAHO] You think
this is a "tiny spat"?

284
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,291
Well, this is already
a brawl, if you ask me.

285
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,208
How cute! Twins who
use their butts together!

286
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,708
Oh, now you've done it!

287
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,125
Mess with my beloved
and you'll feel my wrath!

288
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,125
Back off! In case you forgot,
you guys started this.

289
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,458
Not very bright.

290
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,375
Keep talking smack to us
and we might just have to

291
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,000
do something about it.

292
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,875
Is that a threat?
I wasn't lookin' for a fight

293
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,333
but I tell ya what, big gal,

294
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,333
if that's what you want,
then I'll give it to ya.

295
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,416
This needs to stop right now!

296
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,291
Ms. Kobayakawa?

297
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,083
[MIKU] I'd like to apologize
on behalf of our students

298
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,708
for the trouble they've caused.

299
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,583
[NOZOMI] But this lady
was trash-talkin' you

300
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,291
and the other teachers
at Setouchi!

301
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,791
If anyone should
apologize it's her!

302
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,416
[ALL gasp]

303
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,666
[AYAKO] Hmph! There's nothing
to see here, ladies.

304
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,333
Time to get back to work.

305
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,166
[AKARI, KAHO, NAMI, SAKI]
Right!

306
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,166
Maya. Come along.

307
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,625
Yes.

308
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,333
[MAYA] Something about
that girl bothers me.

309
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,833
What were you thinking?
You trespassed on

310
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,333
private property to pick
a fight with our opponents?

311
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,583
[NOZOMI] You'd understand
if you'd heard what she said!

312
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,208
It doesn't matter, Kaminashi!

313
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,333
What did you achieve
by confronting her?

314
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,250
Absolutely nothing.

315
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,416
If you want to be top athletes,
you need to learn

316
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,375
to solve problems like adults.

317
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,416
Take them to the Land
and beat them fair and square.

318
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,166
That being said...

319
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,875
We were proud to see you
stand up for us like that.

320
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,500
Thank you, ladies.

321
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,458
We're determined to give you the
best Keijo coaching possible.

322
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,958
Tomorrow I want you
to go out there

323
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,541
and show them
what you've learned!

324
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,375
That'll teach 'em to respect us!

325
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,958
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

326
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,791
All right. It's time to go over
the rules of the East-West War.

327
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,625
Things are a little
different this year.

328
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,583
You're going to be competing
in teams of four players.

329
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,791
Each race is five minutes.

330
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,583
The school that's first to win
two races wins the war.

331
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,708
Does anyone have any questions?

332
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,541
We can win two races, right?

333
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,250
Here's hoping we can win
two consecutive races!

334
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,125
It's four-on-four team battles?

335
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
This is gonna be awesome.

your team assignment.

On Team One: Mio Kusakai.

Yay! I'm glad we're
on the same team!

Those Suruga chicks
aren't ready for this!

352

They're gonna regret
picking on us!

353

--[KOTONE] Mm!
--[ALL] Yeah!

354
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,833
This place is foul.
Why's Sayaka competing here?

355
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,208
What a waste of time.
I'm going home.

356
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,083
Oh, no you don't.
You've come this far,

357
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,833
there's no going back.
Now let's go, dear.

[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Ladies and gentlemen,

359

it's time for the spectacular
battle royale featuring

360
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,375
the future stars of Keijo.
The East-West War!

361
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,500
This is our eleventh
annual event to determine

362
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,416
who will rise to the top:
the East or the West!

363
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,875
Who will the goddess of victory
smile upon this year?

364
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,541
That's weird.
Did ya see the line-up?

365
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,958
Yeah! Miss Kaminashi's
in the third race.

366
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,208
I can't wait to see her in ac--

367
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,250
No, not that! The East's
best player's missing.

368
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,083
She's not on here.
That seems odd to me.

369
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,541
Yeah, you're right!

370
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,958
Do they think
the West isn't worthy

371
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,083
of competing against
their best player? Ugh!

372

Man, they're really
down on Setouchi.

373
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,583
[NOZOMI] Oooh!
You guys look amazin'!

374
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,291
If your father
saw you in this outfit,

375
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,083
I bet he'd totally
understand your decision.

Actually, I think it would
have the opposite effect.

about the East-West War.

[NAGISA]
Okay everyone, listen up.

The East-West War is upon us.

382
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,208
You're more than
Setouchi trainees,

you're future pros that will
someday represent the West.

384

This is your chance
to show the world

the skills you've
worked so hard for.

Now go out there
and give 'em a good fight!

[ALL]
Right!

389
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,500
We have a ten year
winning streak

390
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,416
and it's our duty
to keep it going.

391
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,583
The Setouchi trainees
have no idea what it's like

392
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,208
to race against qualified
players like yourselves.

393
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,375
Which means that we'll simply

394
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,416
have to teach
the poor fools a lesson.

395

There's no need
to be compassionate.

They need to learn that the
world of Keijo is unforgiving.

their way to the Land!

First up, from Suruga,
let's hear it for

402
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,458
Saki "The Ogre" Hanayama!

403

Also from Suruga, we have
Kaho and Akari Fuyuzora!

404

These two young ladies
are a special treat

405
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,916
because we rarely see
twins in Keijo!

team is Nami Nanase,

"Ass-Eater Nanase"!

Why? It sounds like
you could use it.

Because you're in
no place to give advice.
