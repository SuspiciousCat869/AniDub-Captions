1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,166
Namu.

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,708
[chuckles]

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,208
Wow, seems like
the infighter team

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,750
had a pretty rough day.

5
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,291
They sure look exhausted.

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,458
They must've raced
with their instructor, too.

7
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,916
I guess their's is hardcore.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,041
Well, I'm gonna head
to the showers.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,500
'Kay, see ya later.

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,500
Oh, hey. Is something wrong?

11
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,166
The rest of the infighters
are hanging out in the lobby.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,083
Listen, Miyata.

13
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,625
Ya think, maybe you could
help me out with somethin'?

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,875
[SAYAKA] You need help?
From me? Sure, what's up?

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,875
[gasps]

16
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,625
U-Um! Why're you
taking off your clothes?

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,666
Well, whaddaya think?

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,666
What do you think of my body?

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,125
I, uh--

20
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,083
[NOZOMI]
Are my boobs proportionate?

21
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,291
I can't really tell.

22
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,375
My nips are kind of
a weird shape, huh?

23
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,666
Are they the right color,
or are they too dark?

24
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,625
[SAYAKA]
Uh. I dunno what to say.

25
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,500
[NOZOMI]
Okay, well then in that case...

26
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,375
What about my backside?

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,041
[NOZOMI] Do ya notice anything
strange about my butt?

28
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,208
Like, is my crack off-center?

29
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,708
C'mon, you can tell me, Miyata.

30
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,666
I would do the same for you!

31
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,416
[SAYAKA]
You're being a total creep!

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,958
[NOZOMI]
No, wait!

33
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,000
Shirayuki told you
that your body has a flaw.

34
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,375
Now you're freaked
and trying to figure out

35
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,458
what could be wrong with you.

36
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,500
Why didn't you just
tell me that before?

37
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,000
Instead you stripped down
and came at me all naked.

38
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,541
I didn't know what to do!

39
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,916
Sorry.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,291
You know, it's funny
'cause that's so you.

41
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,958
There's such
a giant gap of power

42
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,666
between me and my instructor.

43
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,333
I'm not even thinkin'
about tryin' to

44
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,166
beat 'em in a race or anything.

45
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,333
Trust me, I'm not tryin'
to defeat Shirayuki--

46
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,750
that ain't happenin'.
The thing is,

47
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,583
I couldn't do anything at all
and that's what scares me.

48
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
Why's it scare you?

49
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,375
We got a lotta work
to do in six months.

50
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,750
When we go pro,
there's no room for excuses--

51
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,458
skill is all that matters.

52
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,125
It's one thing
if I go out and lose

53
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,666
'cause I'm not good enough,

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,916
but I don't wanna go out there

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,875
thinkin' that
I'll lose every match.

56
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,958
The more I thought about
what Shirayuki said,

57
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,500
the more it put me at a loss.

58
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,791
I dunno where to go
from here, y'know?

59
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
Well then,
maybe you should watch

60
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,875
Shirayuki's moves more closely.

61
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,250
Whaddaya mean?

62
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,916
See, I would pay attention
to her every move

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,875
and compare it to my own.

64
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
It may be the only way
to figure out

65
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,666
the flaw she mentioned to you.

66
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,375
[NAGISA] Excellent work today.
Thank you, Shirayuki.

67
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,500
No problem. I want them to win
as much as you do.

68
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,541
Once we feel like they've
got the basics down,

69
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,166
we're going to make them
wear UTMs while training.

70
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,916
Everybody will wear it?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,041
It might sound crazy
but we think these girls

72
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,375
can change the sport of Keijo.

73
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,750
[SHIRAYUKI] After this
training camp you've got

74
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,500
the East-West War, right?

75
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,958
Yes. So tell me,
what do you think of them?

76
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,375
You've brought some
amazing athletes to this camp.

77
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,250
Aren't they wonderful?

78
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,708
And that Kaminashi girl--
she's fascinating.

79
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,875
I agree. Do think you could
look after her a bit more?

80
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,791
Yeah, I'd love to.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,666
Okay ladies, first
we'll get in the water,

82
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,625
and then we're gonna start
walking up the river.

83
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,875
[HANABI, ATSUKO, MIO]
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,458
I really dunno if I can
figure out my weak point

85
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,625
just by watchin' her, but
I guess it can't hurt to try.

86
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,666
Hmmm...

87
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,208
[NOZOMI] Her posture's awesome.
She keeps her back straight.

88
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,583
Her swimsuit is
super cute. What else?

89
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,500
Let's make like
a bread truck and haul buns!

90
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,125
[NOZOMI]
And she likes lame jokes.

91
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,458
Oh, wow,
this water feels amazing!

92
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,708
The current's stronger
than I thought it'd be.

93
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,250
This is tough, so I can see how

94
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,583
it'll help train
our lower bodies.

95
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,375
[ATSUKO]
This is my kinda training!

96
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,958
My Ass of Vajra
is gonna get even stronger!

97
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,083
[NOZOMI screams]

98
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:22,625
What happened? Are you okay?

99
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,500
A twig got caught
in my cleavage and it scared

100
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,416
the ever-lovin' crap outta me.

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,583
Man, Shirayuki's really fast.

102
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,666
I can't believe she's
already so far ahead.

103
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,458
[HANABI] What do you expect
from an active pro?

104
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't get over
how strong she is--

105
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,708
she's like, super-human.

106
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,583
She kicked my butt
in our introduction race,

107
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,500
like, seriously whooped me.

108
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,833
And now I'm struggling
to even keep up with her.

109
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,291
This is so depressing.

110
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,833
[chuckles]
Yeah, right?

111
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,125
[NOZOMI] She's moving through
the water so elegantly.

112
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,625
It's like she's not even
fightin' the current

113
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,833
when she walks.

114
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,416
But it's not just
her hips and legs

115
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,333
that're helpin' her get through.

116
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,833
She's also usin'
her breasts to knock

117
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,666
any debris outta the way.

118
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,541
[SHIRAYUKI grunts]

119
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,000
Haaauh!

120
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,791
[NOZOMI] It's hard to believe
she can swing her boobs around

121
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,750
like that in
a current this strong.

122
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,458
Wait a sec--she's not just
trainin' her upper body,

123
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,000
she's working on
her lower half, too!

124
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,625
It looks like we're
doin' the same trainin'

125
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,250
as she is, but we're not.

126
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,666
We're only doin' half the work.

127
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,125
[groans]

128
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,125
Take this.
[groans]

129
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:28,708
I can do it.
Should I go right or left?

130
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,500
Nngh! Owie!

131
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,125
[HANABI]
Oh no, not again.

132
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,416
Ouch, that looked like it hurt.

133
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,833
I get it now.
She's also workin' on

134
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,041
her decision-makin' skills.

135
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,916

For this one...

[grunts]

137
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,000
I did it. I thought
it'd be harder

138
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,750
to knock that big one away.

139
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,166
Whoa. I think I might've
figured it out.

140
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,541
A weaker attack
that's hard to read.

141
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,250
Or a powerful attack
that's easy to read.

142
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,875
Yeah, that's it!
My butt's too big!

143
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,875
[NOZOMI grunting]

144
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,125
So tell me, how'd I do?!

145
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,375
[SAYAKA] Well, you're much
slower than before.

146
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,166
What's slowing her down?

147
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,541
I'm not sure
but her figure eights

148
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,125
are going wider now.

149
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,125
I'll explain.
She gained a lot of muscle

150
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,458
in her tush when
she was training for

151
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,833
the Vacuum Butt Cannon.

152
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,916
And normally, that would
be a good thing,

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,708
but the added weight is
making it harder to control.

154

[KAZANE humming]

how strong your attack may be,

if the build-up's that obvious

weird or anything,

You would think it'd have

[SHIRAYUKI] You need to

Thank you for helping us.

If you want to take
your butt to the limit,

223
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,791
like I mentioned
to you last night,

224
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,000
then you're going to
have to learn

225
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,125
a new way to attack with it.

226
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,125
So you're gonna
teach me a new technique?

227
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,666
[SHIRAYUKI] That's correct.
You need a compact move

228
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,541
with a sharp edge
and I know just the one.

229
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,250
In the Keijo lexicon
it's called the Butt Flash.

have to do with

This is much better.

[NON] Those UTMs are
so tight they're worse than

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,500
a sports bra, y'know?

320

Take that! And that!

Don't worry, it'll get easier.

been practicing team play.

That must be a lot fun!

[RIN] Yeah, but it's harder
than you'd think.

You can't just fight, you've
gotta look out for your allies.

Mmmmmm?!

you've got a case
of the clumsies.

I might be a little clumsy
sometimes, but what's it matter?

00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,875
I'm still an elite,
just like you!

346
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,791
I'm perfectly capable
of holding my own!

347

[SAYAKA] Here's the thing. I
wanna believe you, I really do.

Thanks, Sayaka!

349

[SAYAKA] But you keep giving me
reasons to doubt you.

350
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,000
Like right now, for instance.

Do you realize you're wearing
my bra and panties?

352
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,666

I got into the wrong locker!

Please forgive me!
I was wonderin' why

354
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,916
my bra was so tight
all of a sudden.

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,416
What?

356
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
[KAZANE] Calm down, Miyata!
She didn't mean to be rude!

357
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,750
[MIKU] Ladies. Would you
please meet me in the lobby

358
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,291
as soon as you're
finished changing?

359
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,125
Time flies. And now
we have less than a month

360
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,375
to prepare for
the East-West War.

361
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,583
The what now?

362
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,916
How do you not know
about the East-West War?

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,208
I doubt that she bothered
to read the curriculum.

364
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,666
Eeeh!

365
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,625
[RIN]
As popular as Keijo is,

366
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,666
there are only
two schools in the country.

367
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,958
Setouchi Keijo
Training School in the west,

368
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,458
and Suruga Keijo
Training School in the east.

369
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,333
Once a year there's an event
where the best players

370
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,291
from each school compete.
It's called the East-West War.

371
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,916
I've never heard of
it before, but I am so in!

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,375
[KAZANE] It's the whole reason
we came to this training camp.

373
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,416
It's to prepare us
for the East-West War.

374
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
This is your opportunity
to show your friends and family

375
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,708
how far you've come.
So take these

376
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,291
and be sure to invite
your loved ones.

377
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,208
Think of it as a way of
thanking them for their support.

378
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,916
Guess I prob'ly should've
read the curriculum.

379
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,041
I hope my family can make it.

380
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,458
Think yours will, Miyata?

381
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,875
You said that you talked to 'em
when you got here, right?

382
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,500
Did ya get to talk to your dad?

383
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,500
No. I didn't. 'Cause he
refused to get on the phone.

384
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,791
I can't blame him. I mean,
he owns a judo dojo,

385
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,500
and his own daughter
rejected the sport

386
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,333
and ran off to play Keijo.

387
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,333
[NOZOMI]
He'll get over it.

388
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,250
You might as well
invite them, right?

389
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,750
I betcha they'll come to watch.

390
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,083
They'll understand once
they get to see you compete.

391
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,541
You better wear
your cutest swimsuit.

[NOZOMI] If I focus my energy
and yank my butt quickly,

00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,208
I should be able to get it out!

wrong with me?!

'em as hard as I can,

it's still not fast enough
to pull 'em out whole!

I keep trying over
and over again,

but it's just not happenin'!

how bad I suck at this.

you as the farming type.

What's up, Kusakai?

408
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,291
Ms. Shirayuki sent me here
to take you back to the group.

Why? Is it lunch time already?

00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,208
She's got you doing
some weird training.

Are you pulling turnips
with your butt?

Can you believe it?

It's a lot harder
than you would think.

This is my second day at it,
and I've yet to pull a single--

do you think you're doin'?

[NOZOMI] No way. She totally
pulled one out on her first try.

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,250
Just kill me now.

422

I've been at it
for two days with no luck

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,833
and then you come along
and do it no problem.

[NOZOMI grunts]

427
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,583
Lemme get this straight,
your butt gained muscle

428
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,708
from training and now you're
having trouble controlling it

429
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,041
'cause it's heavier, right?

430
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,500
Yeah, so?

431
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,958
Maybe you should try using
the muscles you've gained--

432
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,041
y'know, the ones
that caused this problem?

433
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,875
Huh, I haven't tried that yet.

434
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,500
So you're saying I can
use my butt muscles

435
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,375
to pull the turnips out whole.

436
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,083
That's the only hint you get.

437
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,166
You're gonna have to figure
the rest out on your own.

Aw. C'mon Kusakai,
don't leave me hangin'.

I could use all
of the help I can get!

you come to my bed tonight

00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,291
But why'd that happen?

464
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,916
[NOZOMI]
That's it!

465
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,000
If I think of the turnips
as the muscles in my butt,

466
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,625
then there's no downside
to havin' extra weight.

467
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:27,708
[thunder rumbles]

468
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,958
[BOTH]
Uh?

469
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,416
[FARMER 7A] Aah!

470
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,916
I need to picture it in my head.

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,208
If I imagine
my butt as a weight,

472
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,833
then all I've gotta do is
loosen it up as I raise it,

473
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,791
then yank it quickly.

474
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,416
And that should create
enough momentum!

475
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,750
I can't help
but wonder if the exercise

476
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,666
was a little too hard for her.

477
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,458
Maybe I should just
tell her how it's done. Mm?

478
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,083
Girl, you're lucky
I like turnips.

479
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,458
[laughs]

480
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,666
I know you're eating,
ladies, but listen up.

481
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,000
As you know, tomorrow's the last
day of our elite training camp.

482
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,000
We've decided to conduct
mock races so that

483
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,791
we can see how much
you've improved.

484
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,708
Normally, we would pick
your opponents but we thought

485
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,083
we'd give you the opportunity
this time around.

486
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,500
So if there's anyone
you'd like to fight,

487
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,791
please just let me know.

488
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,166
We can pick our opponents?

489
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,833
It's nice they're letting us
choose but all I know

490
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,541
is who I don't wanna fight.

491
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,291
Ah! I know who I want to go up--

492
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,791
[USAGI] Right here.
I'm Usagi Tsukishita

493
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,875
and I wanna challenge
Nozomi Kaminashi to a race.

494
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,333
[NOZOMI]
Mm?

495
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,583
[gulps]

496
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,916
[GIRL gasps]

497
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Don't underestimate us.
Setouchi'll thrash you!

498
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,875
[NOZOMI] Next time:
"The Dramatic East-West War!!!!"
