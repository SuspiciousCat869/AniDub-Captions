1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:09,833
[NARRATOR] In the past,
gamblers have been limited

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,375
to horse, bike,
boat, and car races.

3
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,625
But now there's a new form
of legalized gambling

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,750
sweeping the nation.
It's called Keijo!

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,916
Players compete
to be the last girl standing

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,458
atop a floating platform
called a "Land."

7
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,500
The kicker? They can only
use their boobs and butts!

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,916
The question is:
who will rule the Land?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,875
Will it be the 18 year old
Nozomi Kaminashi?

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,250
She's one of
the many young ladies

11
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,708
whose search
for fame and fortune

12
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,208
has lead them
to the world of Keijo!

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,375
And this is the story
of their journey

14
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,416
to becoming champions!

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,125
Maya! Dodge it!

16
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,166
[MAYA]
I'm sorry, but I can't.

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,333
I've fought so hard
to earn everyone's respect.

18
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:54,125
If I were to dodge her attack,
I'm afraid I would lose it all.

19
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,916
And things would go back
to the way they were.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,166
And then...
I'll be all alone again.

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,500
No!

22
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,583
[NOZOMI] I landed a perfect hit
with my Vacuum Butt Cannon!

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,416
That should've blown her away
but she didn't even budge!

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,916
[KAYA] Poor little Maya.
This is a bad habit of hers.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,333
She works so hard
she ends up in tears.

26
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,125
You really wore her out.

27
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,625
That's why I offered
to take over for her.

28
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,208
[NOZOMI]
What?

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,875
[NOZOMI groans]

30
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,458
[ANNOUNCER 8A] Kaminashi's lucky
Rokudou was there to catch her!

31
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,625
That was quite a hit
from Sakashiro!

32
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,375
She could barely
stand a second ago!

33
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,958
It's like she's a
completely different player!

34
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,541
[CROWD cheering]

35
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,916
Are you okay?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,708
Uh-huh. I'm fine,
just a little bruised.

37
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,625
[groans]

38
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:53,666
[KAYA yawns]
I've been asleep for so long.

39
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,750
I wasn't expecting
to wake up to this.

40
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,708
We're all beat up. Poor Maya
must've had some trouble.

41
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,833
"Poor Maya"?

42
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,666
What the heck
is she talkin' about?

43
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,291
Hold up. Just what do you
think you're doing, Kaya?

44
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,166
This is no time
for you to take over.

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,958
You gotta get permission
from the instructor

46
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,500
if you wanna fight them.

47
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,166
[HANABI] Who's "Kaya"? Wasn't
her name Maya a second ago?

48
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,333
[TAE]
Yeah, you're right.

49
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,416
She's the girl who
was fighting you before.

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,541
But this is a completely
different person altogether.

51
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,458
Maya's got this other
person living inside her.

52
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,666
And she's Suruga's number one
player: Kaya Sakashiro.

53
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,833
Let me get this straight;

54
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,666
you're saying she's got
two personalities?

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,666
But how is that even possible?

56
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,375
Well, I don't know the science
behind it or anything,

57
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,166
but apparently,
Maya was mistreated

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,833
by adults when she was a kid.

59
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,250
So now whenever she feels
like she's in danger,

60
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,916
she switches personalities.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,208
I guess it's a coping
mechanism or something.

62
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,875
If you only played
as well as you blabber.

63
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,708
They've heard enough, big gal.

64
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,166
Why don't you sit this one out.

65
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
[TAE]
Aaah!

66
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,541
[ANNOUNCER 8B] Yokosugi has
gone overboard! Loser!

67
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,750
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Ooh! This is a first, folks!

68
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,166
Yokosugi from Suruga
was knocked overboard

69
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,291
by her own teammate!
What is Sakashiro thinking?

70
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,541
What is Maya doing?

71
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,041
I don't think that's Maya.

72
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,000
It's Kaya! But what
is she doing out there?

73
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,666
Bring it!

74
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,916
Please forgive me. I realize
what I'm doing is rude.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,291
Normally, I wouldn't dare
to interrupt your battle,

76
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,416
but these are
special circumstances.

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,875
She's far too dangerous
for you to take on alone.

78
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,583
So I'll use my breasts to help!

79
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,375
Now! Draw Boobs!
Quickdraw Gazongas!

[KAYA]
Bare-Breasted Catch.

81
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,000
She caught my boob in hers! Aah!

00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,458
How dare you? Butt Gatling!

Hey, let go of her!

86
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,625
[KAYA] It's pretty pathetic
that two of our best players

87
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,791
were taken out
by weaklings like you.

88
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,166
That means I'm left to do
all the dirty work.

89
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,458
Just so you know,
I'll do whatever it takes

90
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,666
in order to protect poor Maya.

91
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,583
She's more brutal than before.

92
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,791
Ever since she
switched personalities.

93
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,041
This Kaya girl
is a serious threat!

94
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,875
Let go of her!

All right, Kawai!

Nice use of your
trademark critical hit!

99
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,791
Hurry and strike
before she snaps out of it.

Draw Boob--

101

That didn't hurt one bit!

It'll take a lot more
than that to stop me!

We've lost another player;

The Castle Land sinks again!

[NOZOMI] Every time it sinks
we get less playin' area.

who made Maya cry, aren't you?

110
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:46,375
Bad move. If there's
one thing I hate, it's bullies.

to go through all this pain.

I mean, wouldn't it
be a lot easier

127
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,791
to just jump in the pool?

00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,500
Heh. Yeah, probably,
but I'm not one to take

can beat her is if we hit her

with somethin'
that's even stronger

than the techniques
she's already usin'.

Both teams should be proud

of what they've
accomplished today!

I'm really sorry.

00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,250
I did my best,
but it wasn't good enough.

347

I'm here because
you saw potential in me.

You took me into your home.

If anyone should
apologize, it's me.

You're so much more important
to me than Keijo, Maya.

00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,583
So you lost a race.
It's no big deal.

I would never punish you
for such a thing.

Where's Maya?

I dunno, she was still
in her room when I left.

who's, like, an equal.

She's prob'ly exhausted.
She fought hard.

And she's been pushing
herself for a while now.

This is the best thing
that's happened to her.

without the weight

00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,625
But it sucks that everyone else
is goin' their separate ways.

467
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,083
I hate goodbyes. I'm really
gonna miss everybody.

468
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,166
Don't be sad,
we'll see each other again.

469
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,833
It'll just be
on the Land is all!

470
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,208
She's right, y'know!

471
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,666
C'mon, Nozomin! Let's get
everybody together

472
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,250
so we can take some pictures!

473
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,333
And make sure to get
Ms. Ujibe in one, too!

474
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,250
[NOZOMI]
Oh yeah, that's a good idea!

475
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,708
But you might have to shoot in
landscape mode to fit her in.

476
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't wanna
be rude or anything,

477
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,875
but she is pretty wide.

478
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,625
[NAGISA]
Hey!

479
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,583
So you're gonna be
disrespectful to your

480
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,125
predecessor right up
till the very end?

481
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,833
Don't forget who taught you!

482
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,458
[NOZOMI chuckles nervously]

483
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,916
I'll never forget!

484
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,750
Ms. Ujibe, thanks for
everything this year.

485
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,458
I'm eternally grateful to you.

486
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,166
And I promise to make you proud!

487
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,583
Thank you.
Don't hurt yourself out there.

488
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,458
But I wanna see you
go wild, got it?

489
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,000
Right!

490
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,083
[KAZANE] You guys're
gonna have to squish

491
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,000
so I can get everyone
in the frame.

492
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,958
Look at Hanabi tryin' to
sneak in next to Nozomin!

493
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,541
We never should've
let them go first

494
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,333
'cause all they're doing
is goofing off.

495
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,166
C'mon, get serious, ladies.
There are other people

496
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,541
waiting to have
their pictures taken!

497
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,000
[KAZANE]
Okay, I've got the timer set!

498
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,833
Everybody say, "Cheese!"

499
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,833
[NOZOMI] I can't wait
till we meet again!

500
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,125
This time
on a professional Land!

501
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,500
Bye-bye!
Thanks again for everything!

502
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,583
[MIKU] I can't believe
how fast this year went by.

503
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,625
Yeah, this place won't
be the same without them.

504
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,875
That's for sure.

505
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,666
You're right.
But they're off to start

506
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,791
a new chapter in their lives.

507
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,583
Our girls are going to
have a major impact

508
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,250
on the professional circuit.

509
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,041
I just hope the Keijo world
is ready for them.

510
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,708
[NOZOMI] Before competing
professionally,

511
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,125
each graduate must undergo a
month-long introductory course.

512
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,458
Their Keijo debut will be
scheduled around Golden Week.

513
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,083
I guess there's
no turning back now.

514
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,208
[NOZOMI]
Hello, ma'am.

515
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,166
We're makin' our
debut this season.

516
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,791
I'm Nozomi Kaminashi
of the Hyogo branch.

517
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,083
Likewise, I'm Sayaka Miyata.

518
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,000
We're thrilled to be here.

519
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,625
We've been waiting for you two.

520
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,166
Hey, ladies!
The kids who started

521
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,541
the Western Japan
revolution have arrived!

522
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,083
[PLAYERS]
We're happy to have you!

523
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,958
Welcome to the pros!

524
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,333
[BOTH]
Thanks!

525
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,208
[ALL]
The rear end!
