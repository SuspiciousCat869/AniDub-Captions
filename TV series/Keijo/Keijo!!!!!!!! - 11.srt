[KAZANE sobbing]

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,458
I had access to everybody's
butt techniques

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,416
and I still couldn't do it.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,625
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I'm a failure.

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,166
Don't cry, Kazane,
it's not your fault.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,958
I'll bet that we would've won
if I had played better.

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,458
It's not yours either.

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,875
You're being too hard
on yourselves.

9
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,500
You put up a good fight.

10
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,125
[KAZANE]
But we lost.

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,583
[NAGISA]
That was a great race, ladies.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,583
I know it didn't end
the way we wanted,

13
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,041
but you pushed Suruga's team
to the breaking point.

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,000
I could tell by their faces
they were intimidated

15
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,750
by your abilities.

16
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,083
[CROWD cheering]

17
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,291
[ANNOUNCER 8A] All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,458
are you ready
for our third race?

19
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,833
[NAGISA]
We're not out yet, girls.

20
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,583
We've still got one round to go.

21
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,416
Whatever you do, don't lose
faith in your teammates.

22
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,916
Holy cow! Listen to
all that cheering!

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,791
I'm diggin' this whole
professional stadium thing.

24
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,541
This is nuts!
Everybody's watchin' us!

25
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,333
It's like you can
feel their energy!

26
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,791
I've never felt
this kinda excitement

27
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,625
from an audience before.
Awesome!

28
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,958
Yep, definitely
the sport for me!

29
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,333
[ANNOUNCER 8A] It's time for the
climax of the East-West War!

30
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,875
Our competitors are tied
with one win apiece!

31
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,625
Who will win our final battle?

32
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,083
Will it be Suruga? Or Setouchi?

33
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,375
We're about to find out

34
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:59,000
as our teams race atop
a Castle type Land!

35
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,125
[HANABI]
Oh wow, it's so detailed!

36
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,375
It's almost like we're standing
on top of a real castle!

37
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,250
Man, this is badass.
I mean, this is, like,

38
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,125
some Samurai type stuff,
ya know?

39
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,791
[ANNOUNCER 8A] I know you've
been waiting for them,

40
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,500
and here they are, folks!

41
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,333
Let's hear it
for Suruga's final team!

42
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,916
The Buttwall fighter,
Tae Yokosugi!

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,875
Then we have the cool beauty
infighter Midori Morimoto!

44
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,375
Beside her is the enchantress

45
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,958
with the Magician's Bust,
Hikari Muromachi!

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,166
And last but certainly
not least,

47
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,916
we have the player who's
ranked second at Suruga.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,875
The babe with the beautiful
ribbon, Maya Sakashiro!

49
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,375
[RIN]
Took 'em long enough to show up.

50
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,750
I should've known
they'd be "fashionably late."

51
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,541
Yeah! And just like I figured,

52
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,958
the final team has
the girl with the ribbon!

53
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,625
[HIKARI]
Well, this is a surprise.

54
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,416
I honestly didn't think
you guys would make it

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,083
to the third round,
and yet, here we are.

56
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,958
At least the audience
is fired up.

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,791
Just so you know, there won't
be any more upsets today.

58
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,708
You're looking at
the best players at Suruga.

59
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,833
You can't defeat us.
You'd better enjoy the race

60
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,208
while you can 'cause
it'll be over in a flash.

61
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,166
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
One minute until race time!

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,583
We'll just have to
see about that, won't we?

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
[SANAE] Hey, Maya.
I think I understand.

64
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,333
Now that I've raced
against Setouchi, I get it.

65
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,458
Those girls are like
our polar opposites.

66
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,375
Their playing style's fun
and brimming with creativity.

67
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,416
I hope you get to race against
the ribbon girl from Setouchi.

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,041
She's been on your mind
this whole time, right?

69
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,291
You're, like, obsessed.

70
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,500
I think that you'd benefit
from racing her.

71
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,458
Maybe she can help you
fill that hole in your heart.

72
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,958
[MAYA] Whatever,
that doesn't make any sense.

73
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,000
How could racing her
have any effect on me?

74
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,000
At this point,
all I care about

75
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,583
is getting a win
for our instructor.

76
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,583
[ANNOUNCER 8A] This race
will decide the winner

77
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,250
of the East-West War.

78
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's find out which Keijo
school is the strongest!

79
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,500
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
The race will start in five.

80
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,916
Four. Three. Two. One!

81
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,125
[NOZOMI]
This is my way of sayin' hello!

82
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,625
[grunts]

83
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,625
Whoa, how'd she
block me so easily?

84
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,041
[MAYA] I don't understand.
Her lame attacks

85
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,666
couldn't possibly
have any effect on me.

86
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,375
[NOZOMI screams]

87
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,000
That's the technique
from before.

88
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,791
A strong strike with no windup.

89
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,875
But it's different
than the Butt Flash.

90
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,458
How the heck is she doin' it?

91
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,083
Ah. I see our princess is
facing off against her favorite.

92
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,375
I have to admit,
she's got some nice moves.

93
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,125
But what a fool.
She should know better

94
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,250
than to charge at the enemy--

95
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,875
No interrupting!
[chuckles]

96
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
This is serious business.

97
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,208
Nozomi and that girl are
fighting a battle of the bow

98
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,625
to see who's strongest!

99
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,208
So don't get in their way.
I mean, that's just rude.

100
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,958
Why not fight me instead?

101
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,666
Huh. You honestly think you
can take on a supernatural siren

102
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,208
and her Magician's Bust?

103
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,416
Hell yeah, as long as
you're standing on the Land!

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,666
[yelling]

105
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,125
Please be
more careful, Muromachi.

106
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,958
Don't you remember
what our instructor said?

107
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,250
We need to watch out
for Setouchi this year.

108
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,541
What's with her butt?

109
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,916
It gets harder and harder
every time I hit it!

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,333
Freak show!

111
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,625
Although, lucky for me,
outfighters are my specialty.

112
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,458
It doesn't matter
how many times you try,

113
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,041
you can't just keep attacking
and expect to beat me.

114
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,375
You're going to need
a strategy of some sort.

115
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,750
But you'll never figure out
my bum's secret.

116
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,125
Oh yeah?
That's what you think!

117
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,250
[gasps]

118
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,708
[NOZOMI snorting]
It's so soft!

119
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,375
What is this smell?

120
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,666
It's gotta be some kinda
girly bath soap.

121
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Stop! Don't sniff me!

122
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,958
How dare you? You nasty pervert!

123
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,916
Ow! That hurt!
I knew I was in for some pain,

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,166
but man, that stings
at point blank!

125
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,833
Damn! I can't use
my hands during the race

126
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,583
so that was my only option.

127
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,583
But now I've solved the mystery!

128
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,208
And I know what's
behind your attacks!

129
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,791
What? But all she did
was sniff my butt!

130
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,250
She must be bluffing!

131
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,333
There's no way she could've
figured it out like that!

132
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,958
[NOZOMI] Y'know, I had a hunch,
and it turns out I was right.

133
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,166
You don't tense up
before you strike.

134
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,125
Somehow you're able to keep
your butt completely relaxed,

135
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,833
which is why
it felt so soft to me.

136
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,625
[NOZOMI] But the moment
you start to strike,

137
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,083
enormous pressure is released--

138
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,000
like you're pushin' somethin'
out from deep within ya.

139
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,291
Spill it. You're usin'
Qigong techniques

140
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,166
to build up that power,
aren't ya?

141
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,708
Huh? No, uh... I dunno
what you're talking about.

142
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,291
--You're a bad liar!
--Uuh!

143
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,500
By Qigong do you mean
the practice used

144
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,375
in Chinese martial arts?

145
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,291
[TAE] Heh. You honestly think
figuring out the secret

146
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,416
to our attacks
is gonna help you win?

147
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,041
It doesn't matter
what you know if you don't

148
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,958
have the strength to take us on!

149
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,541
[NOZOMI]
Wait, this looks like a...

150
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,041
...Buttack on Titan!

151
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,458
[NOZOMI screams]

152
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,250
What? Maya!

153
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,666
Get outta the way!
Just whaddya think you're doing?

154
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,833
[MAYA] I apologize, Tae.
But I can't let you sink her--

155
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,416
not until I get to fight her.

156
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,166
Sorry about this.
Internal Butt Release!

157
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,375
[TAE]
What?

158
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,166
Whoa, you threw her
like she was nothin'!

159
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,166
[yells]

160
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,500
I see. You're building
momentum for your next strike.

161
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,500
There's no sense in trying
to take me head-on.

162
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,583
It's useless.

163
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,500
You can't beat me
by charging at me.

164
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,875
You'd think you would have
learned that by now.

165
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,166
[NOZOMI]
Gotcha! Surprised ya, huh?

166
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,791
You've gotten used to counter
attacking at the last minute.

167
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,000
But if the hit never comes,
you get knocked off balance!

168
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,375
You're mine!

169
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,458
[MAYA]
Internal Boob Release!

170
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,125
That's crazy! She can do it
with her boobs, too?

171
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,750
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Whoa! Kaminashi goes flying!

172
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,166
And that is the awesome power
of Sakashiro's breasts!

173
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,041
[MAYA] I suppose that
I was wrong about you.

174
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,375
I thought the butt-sniffing
stunt you pulled was stupid.

175
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,166
But it actually helped you
find the strengths

176
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,333
and weaknesses of
my Internal Butt Release.

177
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,083
It's odd. You've got
me frazzled... perv.

178
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,875
[NOZOMI] Damn it.
That hit was so powerful!

179
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,875
She can strike from
the front and the back.

180
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,708
I totally understand
why Suruga has her

181
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,000
and her friends
on their anchor team.

182
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,833
They're tough.

183
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,166
Rin-rin. We've gotta
win this race, 'kay?

184
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,833
Not only for our teammates
but also 'cause

185
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,541
I wanna be the cover story
of the next Keijo Monthly.

186
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,916
Yeah, yeah. You already told me.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,375
Then I won't have to
look for a boyfriend

188
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,875
'cause the boys'll flock to me!

189
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,916
Okay, okay! Look,
I'll do the best I can for ya.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,458
Aw, how sweet;
you're looking for a boyfriend?

191
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,041
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

192
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,291
but you're not
getting that cover,

193
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,833
so I'm afraid
you'll have to stay thirsty.

194
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,500
I may be a little boy crazy,
but I'm not thirsty

195
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,375
by any means! I just haven't
found the right guy yet.

196
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,083
I'm sure. Lemme ask,
do you girls like magic?

197
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,458
Because I've got
a supreme illusion

198
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,708
that I am simply
dying to show you!

199
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,708
For real? You're gonna
do a trick for us?

200
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,875
Watch this! I'll unleash
my Bust Power! Haaa!

201
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,875
What? Why are her boobs
glowing like that?

202
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,500
[RIN] Wait a minute.
Where'd they go?

203
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,083
[HANABI]
They're gone!

204
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,750
I got a direct hit on her and
she's still coming after me?

205
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,125
[RIN]
Haaa!

206
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
Wow, she's really determined
to land a critical hit!

207
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,125
If you know what's good for ya,
you'll watch the magic show!

208
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,208
[HANABI] She made her boobs
glow and she vanished again!

209
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,083
Kawai! Are you all right?

210
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,125
I'm fine.
She just threw me off.

211
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,708
It's no wonder these girls
are Suruga's last resort.

212
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,791
They've certainly got
some pretty unique talents.

213
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,125
Yeah, we've got lots
of tricks up our sleeves.

214
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,875
Just wait. You ladies
haven't seen anything yet.

215
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,875
This magician's got skills!

216
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,041
She's gone!

217
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,333
Please, that's not magic!

218
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,750
You're not a good
magician. For real.

219
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,541
You can't do a trick
three times.

220
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,625
'Cause now I know you're just

221
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,833
reflecting the sunlight
off your baps.

222
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,833
I see.

223
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,416
That's seriously
all she's doing?

224
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,208
[HANABI]
Yep, it's not magic at all!

225
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,750
She's flexing
her pectoral muscles

226
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,500
to angle her chest
towards the sun.

227
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,916
The light then
reflects off of her

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,291
and into her opponent's eyes.

229
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,875
Look closer,
you'll notice she has a layer

230
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,208
of oil on her chest
to make it shine more.

231
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,708
All right, you got me.

232
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,125
I gotta admit, I'm impressed
you figured it out so fast.

233
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,250
That said, it doesn't
make a difference.

234
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,416
You may know how my Bust Power
works, but you can't avoid it!

235
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,750
Ha! If you're using the sun
to blind us, that means

236
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,041
you're still standing where
the glare is comin' from!

237
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,583
[grunts]

238
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,833
They switched places?

[ANNOUNCER 8A] What a perfect
combination by Suruga!

246
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,541
Their teamwork has been
absolutely amazing this round.

247
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,833
Muromachi's oiled-up orbs

248
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,958
are throwing Setouchi
off their game.

249
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,666
Man, this sucks!
We know how she's blinding us

250
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,875
but there's nothing
that we can do about it!

251
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,083
I know. I think we need
to take her out first.

252
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,166
Me too. Can you do it?

253
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,125
I can try. If you'll just
keep fluffy hair occupied

254
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,541
for the next twenty seconds,

255
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,708
I'll sink her before
she's able to flash us.

256
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,416
She can't keep up with my speed.

257
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,166
[HANABI] Sounds like a plan!
Well, I guess it's now or never!

258
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,708
My, how naïve.
You know you can't beat me

259
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,583
one-on-one, why try?

260
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,125
So you're fast; do you think
your speed's gonna save you?

261
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,375
It doesn't matter
how quick you are,

262
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,750
I can still use my
Boob Flash to blind you.

263
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,541
Ha! I'll believe it
when I see it, Hentai Mask!

264
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,833
We can make that happen.

265
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,916
You can't say that
I didn't try to warn you.

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,458
As fast as you are,

Why is she topless?
Is she some kind of deviant?

271
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,208
I don't really wanna find out!

272

Where's the sun?
What's that? Her swimsuit top?

275
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,583
She blocked the sunlight!

[ANNOUNCER 8A] Well, this is
a first, ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,791
Rokudo threw
her top into the air

280
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,583
to counter
Muromachi's attack

281
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,750
with a "Boob Flash"
technique of her own!

282
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,583
It looks like the team
from Setouchi is willing

283
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,625
to do whatever it takes to win!

She did what?

Muromachi, you okay over there?

00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,750
I'm good. Just a little rattled
'cause I never thought

I'd fall for

of our ultimate combination.

309
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,500
For shame.
Despite what you may think,

310
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,666
we're not two players
sharing a swimsuit.

311

We're no longer individuals.

312

We are now a single player
who's unstoppable.

If you thought our boob
and butt techniques

314

Right? It's not like
you can help in this situation.

sink with your friend

we're more than happy to oblige.

325
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,750
I was thinking
more along the lines

326
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,541
of pushing you ladies back.

327

You've gotta be kidding.
You really think you can?

then attack 'em to get revenge.

It's a matter of pride!

337
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,291
Remember what
Ms. Ujibe taught us?

338
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,583
She said you'll never grow
if you only play Keijo to win.

339
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,375
You have to fight for something.

340
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,541
Your family, your dreams,
whatever it may be;

341
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,458
you need a reason.

342
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,125
Well, it didn't take me
very long to come up with one.

343
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,541
In fact, all I had to do
was look around me.

344
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,375
I fight for you guys.

345
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,958
The bond we share as
teammates is unbreakable!

346
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,125
That's why I refuse
to abandon you!

No! How did she deflect that?

My opponent's size
hindered my view.

You're right on time!
There's no need for seppuku!

00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,166
Vacuum Butt Cannon!

463
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,625
[groans]

464
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,291
[MAYA] You can attack me
all you want, but I told you,

465
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,041
I'm not gonna lose this race.

466
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,500
I've got too much at stake. So--

467
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,708
My legs!

468
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,250
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Tough break for Sakashiro!

469
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,000
Looks as though
her legs are giving out!

470
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,541
[NOZOMI yells]

471
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,791
Maya! Dodge it!

472
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,875
[MAYA]
I'm sorry, but I can't.

473
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,000
I've fought so hard
to earn everyone's respect.

474
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,750
If I were to dodge her attack,
I'm afraid I would lose it all

475
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,416
and things would go back
to the way they were.

476
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,916
If that happens,
nobody will need me anymore!

477
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,541
And then...
I'll be all alone again.

478
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,916
No!

479
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,458
[NOZOMI] I landed a perfect hit
with my Vacuum Butt Cannon!

480
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,708
That should've blown her away
but she didn't even budge!

481
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,958
[KAYA] Poor little Maya.
This is a bad habit of hers.

482
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,416
She works so hard
she ends up in tears.

483
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,250
You really wore her out.

484
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,666
That's why I offered
to take over for her.

485
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,208
[NOZOMI]
What?

486
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,083
[NOZOMI groans]

487
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,333
Oh, no! That was
a direct hit to her gut!

488
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,500
[ANNOUNCER 8A] Kaminashi's
lucky Rokudo was there

489
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,416
to catch her! That was
quite a hit from Sakashiro!

490
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,166
She could barely stand
a second ago!

491
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,250
It's like she's a
completely different player!

492
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,708
[KAYA chuckles]

493
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,875
[NOZOMI] Next time: "The Heated
Battle's Rear-End!!!!"
