00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,791
you were bragging about
how fast you are

315
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,333
and now you can't even move!

316
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,791
I bet you regret wasting
all those years practicing judo,

317
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,375
'cause you're no match
for a dedicated

318
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,791
Keijo player like me.

319
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,666
I've been going to
Keijo camps since I was

320
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,500
in elementary school!
I hated milk when I was a kid

321
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,708
but I drank it anyway
to make my boobs bigger!

322
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,541
Unlike you, I've remained
faithful to my sport!

323
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,750
I could never throw away
all my years of hard work

324
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,875
but that's exactly what you did
when you dropped out of judo!

325
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,041
[SAYAKA groans]

326
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,833
[SAYAKA'S FATHER]
You're willing to throw it away?

327
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,125
Your years of experience--

328
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,958
not to mention your hard work.

329
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,833
You want to give up
all your achievements

330
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,958
just so you can try
your hand at another sport?

331
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:25,875
[SAYAKA] I may be new at this,
but I work hard and train hard.

332
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,750
Lemme show you!

333
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,541
I thought she was
completely worn out

334
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,875
but she's still going strong!

335
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,166
Who cares if you've trained
for Keijo your whole life?

336
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,375
That doesn't make you
better than me.

337
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,208
Sayaka.

338
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,166
Sure I have to prove myself,

339
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,333
prob'ly more than anyone else.
But I'll do it because

340
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,500
I've always dreamed of
standing on the Land!

341
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,958
[gasps, giggles]

342
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,500
[SAYAKA] I'm not here because
I "ran away from judo."

343
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,833
No, I'm here
because I love Keijo!

344
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,958
I'm finally living my dream!

345
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,583
Why's she fondling her boobs?

346
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,541
She's really goin' at 'em, huh?

347
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,416
She can't do too much
with 'em. They're A-cups!

348
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,166
You think you can attack me with
those mosquito bites of yours?

349
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,583
Gimme a break!

350
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,958
Remember, I've got
the power of synesthesia

351
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,291
which means I can see
right through your attacks!

352
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,958
[NAMI gasps]
Her entire body's relaxed.

353
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,250
Don't tell me she's
gonna throw the match?

354
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,500
[gasps]

355
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,250
Her tits! They're the
only part of her that's red!

356
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,958
I don't understand why she's
focusing all her energy there.

357
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,125
[SAYAKA yells]

358
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,875
Holy friggin' crap,
her nips are beaming!

359
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,625
[SAYAKA yelling]

360
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,916
She caught my swimsuit
on her erect nipple!

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,375
[yells]

362
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,041
Oh, my! But isn't that move...

363
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,875
No, It can't be.

364
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,833
[SAYAKA'S FATHER] Judo relies
heavily on the lower body

365
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,250
so we need to
build those muscles, too.

366
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,041
You can use your rear end to
knock your opponent off balance.

367
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,041
C'mon, use your butt!

368
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,458
[SAYAKA'S FATHER]
Sayaka.

369
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,416
[SAYAKA] You missed out
training in only Keijo

370
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,208
'cause I've learned all kinds
of judo techniques

371
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,916
that've made me
a better athlete!

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,958
You think you're
so much better than me?

373
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,625
Well, I'm about
to prove you wrong!

374
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,875
[NAMI screams]

375
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,791
The Nipple Full
Shoulder Throw!

376
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,125
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
Nanase is down!

377
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,708
[SAYAKA'S FATHER]
Hm!

378
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,750
[KAHO, AKARI scream]

379
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,250
[ANNOUNCER 8B] Akari and Kaho
Fuyuzora have gone overboard!

380
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,166
Loser!

381
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,250
Nami Nanase has fallen! Loser!

382
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,291
--[bell ringing]
--[CROWD cheering]

383
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,875
[ANNOUNCER 8A] That's the end
of our first race!

384
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,000
[ANNOUNCER 8A]
The first round goes to the West

385
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,833
after a stunning upset
over the reigning champs!

386
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,500
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen,

387
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,833
Setouchi's won the first race
of the East-West War!

388
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,416
Hell yeah!

389
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,750
They did it! We won!

390
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,375
Miyata was amazing
out there, wasn't she?

391
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,958
[AYAKO]
We were mistaken about them.

392
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,625
Who'd've thought Sayaka Miyata

393
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,375
would become such
an asset to their team?

394
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,916
It's all because of that seal.

395
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,791
[CROWD cheering]

396
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,166
[SAYAKA'S FATHER]
Good work today, Sayaka!

397
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,208
[SAYAKA]
You're here. Mom! Dad!

398
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,583
[NON]
Welcome back, Team One!

399
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,208
You guys absolutely killed it!

400
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,625
[KAZANE]
Yeah, and you looked so cool!

401
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,541
[HANABI] That'll show 'em
not to mess with Setouchi!

402
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,958
[USAGI] My beloved Kusakai,
you were amazing!

403
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,000
[NAGISA]
I'm very proud of you, ladies.

404
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,083
That was an incredible race.

405
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,958
[ALL]
Thanks!

406
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,958
Your wedgie acceleration
was freaking insane!

407
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
You kicked ass out there!

408
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,708
What's wrong?
You're not hurt, are you?

409
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,583
My dad's here.
He came to watch me.

410
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,041
[gasps]

411
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,750
My parents are in the stands.

412
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,541
Both of them, my mom and dad.

413
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,541
But that's a good thing,
don't cha think?

414
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,875
Well, yeah. I'm just
kinda confused 'cause

415
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,708
I didn't tell them about
the East-West War.

416
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,250
When you put it like that,
I guess it is a little weird.

417
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,791
Then again, maybe not.

418
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,000
Parents are always
watching their kids.

419
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,708
You really think so?
I'd like that.

420
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,208
I do, which means we
need to work even harder!

421
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,833
Gotta make sure our parents
have a reason to cheer us on!

422
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,416
I'm all for it! I really
wish I'd had the chance

423
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
to win a gold medal in judo.

424
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,500
But I know that
I'll make it up to them

425
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,916
when I become
a Keijo prize queen.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
Now wait one minute.

427
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,375
Oh, I know! I can
buy them a massage chair

428
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,000
that's made out of pure gold!

429
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,791
Yeah, that'd be nice.

430
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,583
Um, I dunno
about that, Miyata.

431
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,916
Right, a gold massage
chair wouldn't be comfy.

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,750
No, if anybody'll be
a prize queen, it'll be me!

433
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,958
You've gotta be kidding me!
Let's be real here,

434
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,916
I've got a much better shot
at it than you do!

435
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,458
[NOZOMI] Whatever!
You ain't got nothin' on me!

436
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,958
When I become a prize queen

437
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,541
my parents are getting
a Harley, a Benz, a Cessna,

438
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,083
and a golden massage chair.

439
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,958
[SAYAKA] Uh! You can't just
steal my idea! That's so rude!

440
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,333
Told ya the West's players
are strong this year.

441
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,208
I gotta admit, they were great.
Lots of talent.

442
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,625
Miyata was awesome.

443
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,250
She'd make a good
cover story, huh?

444
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,291
Yeah! But I think we
should hold off on that decision

445
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,250
until we've seen what the rest
of Setouchi's team can do.

446
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,500
[SAYAKA'S FATHER]
She was amazing out there.

447
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,541
I don't think I've ever
seen her so driven.

448
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,000
She's a completely
different person

449
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,250
than the judo champion I raised.

450
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,750
[SAYAKA'S MOM]
But she has the same smile.

451
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,958
That's true.

452
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:51,541
I'm glad that you've finally
found where you belong, Sayaka.

453
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,291
[SANAE] My twisting
techniques are unstoppable.

454
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,000
And they're not
limited to my butt!

455
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,250
[gasps]

456
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,708
Perky Pile-Piper!

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,916
[NOZOMI] Next time: "The Second
East-West War Race!!!!"
