1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,041
[NOZOMI] It's a big day here
at Setouchi Training School.

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,916
We're currently in the middle
of the class-change race.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,875
I'm in the regular
class right now,

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,791
but if all goes well, I'm gonna
be movin' up to elite class!

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,625
It's time to show 'em how
hard I worked this month.

6
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,041
I'm gonna win this race,
no matter what!

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,541
Uh? What's going on?

8
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,375
That's weird. I feel so
much lighter than before.

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,541
Hey. This must be
the UTM payin' off.

10
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,041
All right! I've
totally got this!

11
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,583
Watch out, elite class!
I'm comin' for ya!

12
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,875
Leave me alone! I despise you!

13
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,083
Really?

14
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,041
Well, In that case,
I might as well do something

15
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,250
that'll make you hate me more.

16
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,333
[MAN B gasps]

17
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,875
But what're you--?

18
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,500
[MAN A chuckles]

19
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,125
--I can't believe her!
--That's the stuff.

20
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,416
[splash]

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,708
[HITOMI]
Group four will be competing

22
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,000
atop a Fountain-Type Land.

23
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,958
The race will begin
in five minutes.

24
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,416
Competitors, please make
your way to the pool.

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,791
Guess it's time.

26
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,458
[NOZOMI]
Hey, Fujisaki.

27
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,958
Hope you don't mind,
they let me draw the Land.

28
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,833
I'm excited. I've never been
on a fountain one before.

29
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,791
Yeah? Good for you.

30
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,208
What's up with her?

31
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,791
Is she gonna wear those
headphones throughout the match?

32
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,375
Do ya mind if I ask
what you're listenin' to?

33
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,125
Guess she doesn't think
we're a challenge.

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,208
[KOTONE]
Give that back!

35
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,250
I just wanna hear
what you're into!

36
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,500
You're so strong, but I'll
make you weak in the knees.

37
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,416
What in the heck was that?

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,166
[NOZOMI] I wonder if
Fujisaki's a strong fighter.

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,333
Well, she's gotta
be at least decent.

40
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,791
I mean, she's elite.

41
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,583
You've gotta be kidding me!
Fujisaki's a thoroughbred!

42
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,583
What's that supposed to
mean? Thoroughbred how?

43
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,333
Her mother was a pro Keijo
player back in the day.

44
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,750
Not only that, she was
also a major prize queen.

45
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,625
[NOZOMI]
Seriously?

46
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,750
She's the daughter
of a prize queen?

47
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,125
[HANABI]
Oh, that's nothing.

48
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,541
Her older sister's currently
a pro Keijo player.

49
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,708
She's been surrounded by the
sport ever since she was a kid.

50
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,416
Sounds like she's gonna be
a tough one to beat, Nozomin.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,625
No worries.

52
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,000
Now that I'm out of
that UTM contraption,

53
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,083
I'm in tip top shape.

54
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,791
I've got this in the bag.

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,291
[SAYAKA]
Don't be too cocky.

56
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,666
That'll get you into
trouble, you know.

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,208
[NON] I'm worried
'cause we have no idea

58
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,625
what kinda techniques
she's gonna try to use.

59
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,208
And we all saw what
happened with Kusakai.

60
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,750
Hey, guys. Speaking of,
where's Kazane?

61
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,666
She's bummed about losing.

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,416
Said she needs to be
alone for a while.

63
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,541
I feel bad for her.

64
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,750
Worry about her later.

65
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,333
You've gotta focus on
your race right now.

66
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,541
You're up!

67
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
Keep your eyes on
your opponents, okay?

68
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,041
[NOZOMI]
Mhm.

69
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,958
You don't have to tell me!

70
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,916
[NOZOMI] Whoa, this Land's
incredibly slippery.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,041
If I'm not careful
I might fa-- Ah!

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh no, I'm sorry!

73
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,291
Wow. Guess that's a
thoroughbred for ya.

74
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,291
You weren't even fazed by--

75
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,125
Um.

76
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,375
I wanna be the only
man you care about!

77
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,291
Now you're finally
being honest with me.

78
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,083
Yes.

79
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,416
Huh? What are you lookin' at?

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
[KOTONE squeals]

81
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,500
[KOTONE]
I know what you heard earlier,

82
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,041
but it's not what
you're thinking!

83
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,083
I swear! I'm totally not into
BL! Not even a little bit!

84
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,750
[NOZOMI]
Okay?

85
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,958
[MIKU] The next race
will start in ten seconds.

86
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,375
[HANABI]
Uh-oh, I completely forgot!

87
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,666
I was supposed to
warn Nozomi. Oopsie.

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,416
About what?

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,625
[MIKU]
Five seconds...

90
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,333
[HANABI] I wanted to
warn her to watch out

91
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,333
for Fujisaki's Cerberus.

92
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,541
[SAYAKA]
Excuse me?

93
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,208
[MIKU]
Two. One.

94
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,291
What ithe hell?

95
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,291
Why's she keepin'
her back turned?

96
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,708
It's kinda weirdin' me out.

97
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,625
[SHIZUKA] You think this'll be
an easy win, don't ya?!

98
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,666
What?! She dodged and
still got a hit on me?

99
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,458
And she wasn't even
facin' this way!

100
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,708
She could hear you coming!

101
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,250
If you wanna sink her,
you gotta be stealthy!

102
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,583
[yells]

103
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,916
She got me!

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,291
[REI screams]

105
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,125
Whoa, she can dodge and
attack without even lookin'.

106
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,666
[KOTONE] I'm dying to find
out what happens next

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,166
in <i>Weak-Kneed Boy</i> ,
so I'm gonna wrap this up.

108
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,375
[roaring]

109
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,583
[ALL gasp]

110
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,916
What's gotten into her?

111
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,958
Her butt's chasing me
around the Land!

112
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,250
[HANABI chuckles]

113
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,875
Most Keijo players
have to train hard

114
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,458
to turn their butts into
weapons, but not her.

115
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,583
Cerbie. Fetch.

116
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,458
[CERBERUS growling]

117
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,666
[HANABI] Fujisaki's butt
does all the work for her.

118
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,583
[MIKU] Kimura has gone
overboard. Loser!

119
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,500
[NON]
That's Cerberus?

120
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,291
[SAYAKA]
It's like a hunting dog.

121
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,041
[roars]

122
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,333
"Cerbie"?

123
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,916
The rumors are true.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,458
You can knock your opponents off
with your back turned to 'em.

125
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,416
[KOTONE]
There's only two left.

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,666
Let's hurry and finish this.

127
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,000
She noticed!

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,666
[NOZOMI]
She's reading my moves.

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,541
Aw, crap!

130
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,750
[NOZOMI yelping]

131
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,250
The way that you responded
to my attack just now...

132
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
...you're amazin'!

133
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,416
It's almost like your butt's
got a mind of its own!

134
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,500
[NOZOMI] Hey! Why dontcha
turn around and face us?

135
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:50,708
[MEN laughing]

136
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,500
Yes.

137
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,958
[NOZOMI] I expected more
from a "thoroughbred."

138
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,083
You're just flyin' by
the seat of your pants!

139
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,333
Don't you care about the race?

140
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,916
[KOTONE] If I'm being honest,
I don't care at all.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,458
I don't enjoy playing Keijo.
It's just a job to me.

142
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,500
It is?

143
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,750
[KOTONE]
All I have to do is show up

144
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,291
and Cerbie'll knock my
opponents off the Land.

145
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,541
I don't love it, but if I can
make decent money playing,

146
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,000
then I might as well.

147
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,416
[REI] Huh? What the hell are
you going on and on about?

148
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
I get it.

149
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,500
Keijo's not as important to you
as it is to the rest of us here.

150
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,416
You're interested in other
things. What was it again?

151
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,750
B-- B--

152
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,083
[KOTONE] No! I don't know
where you got that idea,

153
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:29,625
but you're wrong!

154
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,750
I'm not into BL!

155
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,291
Oh, yeah! That's it: BL!

156
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,333
Ugh. What's it even
matter to you anyway?

157
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,958
I'm ready to get
this race over with

158
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,708
so you'll just leave me alone.

159
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,791
[NOZOMI]
Then bring it on!

160
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,583
But I'm tired of
lookin' at your back.

161
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,250
You're gonna have to face me.
Whether you like it or not.

162
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,666
You're never gonna
forget the day

163
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,541
you raced Nozomi Kaminashi.

164
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,083
Just watch, you'll see.

165
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,541
What do you think you're doing?

166
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,500
You can't defeat her
all on your own!

167
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,875
Fujisaki's ass is
basically a homing missile

168
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,291
and we're its targets!

169
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,583
If we wanna sink her,
then we have to work together.

170
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,583
But I like to work alone.

171
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,916
[roaring]

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,458
That's enough talk.

173
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,125
It's time I sent you
two overboard.

174
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,375
[NOZOMI screams]

175
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,291
Let's see you try!

176
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,625
That was nuts!
Did you see her counter?

177
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,541
I don't get it. Does she
not have any blind spots?

178
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,791
[KOTONE]
You can run from Cerbie,

179
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,333
but there's nowhere
you can hide.

180
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,833
Not as long as you're
on the Land, anyway.

181
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,750
Damn, you're persistent!

182
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,833
[screams]

183
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,791
[KOTONE] You can see
which way she's gonna fall.

184
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,041
Knock her off, Cerbie.

185
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,625
Nozomi!

186
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,541
Uh! That was close!

187
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,000
Huh? What happened?

188
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,833
She totally missed.

189
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,750
I've never seen her miss before.

190
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,875
[KOTONE]
I need to pay more attention.

191
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,666
If I keep rushing things, then I
won't be able to read her moves.

192
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,666
Wait. Why do I even care?

193
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,250
It's not like me.

194
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,875
I'll just leave everything
to Cerbie as usual.

195
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,458
[gasps]

196
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,208
[splash]

197
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,791
[NOZOMI]

198
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,333
I'm gonna push you off!

199
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,291
[KOTONE]
Get her, Cerbie.

200
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,833
I've got you now. The race
is as good as over.

201
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,208
[gasps]

202
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,541
Obedience class
is now in session!

203
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,250
My "Vibe-Ring Hip"'ll tame ya!

204
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,000
Did you seriously think
you were gonna beat me?

205
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,791
Wow, Nozomi's a genius!

206
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,916
She's using Fujisaki's
own body against her.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,458
How so?

208
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,791
Well, let's just say, she's
sensitive south of the border.

209
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,958
[KOTONE]
What's going on?

210
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,250
She's completely
throwing me off my game!

211
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,250
This has to stop!
I can't take it anymore!

212
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,125
[KOTONE] Forget it!
I won't let you beat me!

213
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,708
This is the first time...
that I've wanted to fight.

214
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,000
I've never wanted to
sink someone so badly.

215
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,125
[chuckles]

216
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,250
Well, you finally
faced me. Let's go!

217
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,500
[HANABI] Fujisaki can feel
even the smallest vibrations

218
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,875
on the Land with
the soles of her feet.

219
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,416
It's how she's able to read
her opponent's moves.

220
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,375
So that's what you meant by
"sensitive south of the border."

221
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,583
Uh-huh.

222
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,333
That's basically the
secret behind Cerberus.

223
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,250
Aha! I knew there had
to be somethin' to it.

224
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,708
Normally, she keeps her back to
her opponents the whole time,

225
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,166
but she can't today.

226
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,125
Nozomi's making this
race difficult for her

227
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,625
by attacking in ways
she can't predict.

228
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,416
That's why Cerberus is off.

229
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,250
[KOTONE] Grab her and throw
her off the Land, Cerbie.

230
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,458
[NOZOMI] What an amazin'
combo! I can't dodge it!

231
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,416
You would think she'd let
Nozomin recover between attacks.

232
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,375
No, she's doing
it intentionally.

233
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:11,291
That must be Cerberus's
fighting style. Yes.

234
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,333
It reminds me of the way
a hunter and her dog

235
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,458
would work together.

236
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,166
Talk about intense!

237
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,833
[KOTONE]
I'm done playin' games.

238
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,291
Crap!

239
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,416
How'd I miss again?

240
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
Barely evaded.

241
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,291
Looks like I'll have to start
gettin' creative with my moves.

242
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,750
She got away.

243
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,333
Let's try it again. Cerbie!

244
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,958
Yay! Way to go, Nozomi.

245
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,916
She's using her gymnastic
skills to avoid Fujisaki.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,500
The UTM sure made her stronger!

247
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,125
There we go.

248
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,916
I'm still here.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,083
But all I'm really doin' is
runnin' from her attacks.

250
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,958
[KOTONE] Oh, come on!
Just fall off already!

251
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,458
I'm over this lame race.

252
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,625
Well, I'm not about to
go down without a fight.

253
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,333
I've got an attack
that'll finish you off.

254
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,500
[NOZOMI]
What's it doin'?

255
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,125
[NOZOMI screams]

256
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,833
[KOTONE gasps]

257
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,333
How the hell is she still
standing? It makes no sense.

258
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,291
[NOZOMI]
I dunno if I'll make it.

259
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,500
If she hits me with that big
attack again, I'm done for.

260
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,875
What now?

261
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,708
I've gotta think. There must
be somethin' I can do.

262
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,125
What is it with you?

263
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,250
Why won't you fall off the land?

264
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,416
Just give up!

265
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,208
[NOZOMI]
There's no way that's happenin'.

266
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,625
'Cause I wanna win!

267
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,000
You may be strong, but I
won't let you defeat me!

268
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,041
[gasps]

269
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,000
[NOZOMI]
I swear, I will... beat you!

270
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,833
The way she's twisting
and spinning...

271
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,916
Here goes.

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,333
[NOZOMI]
Take this!

273
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,958
[KOTONE]
That was insane!

274
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,541
Where'd all that
power come from?

275
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,708
Vacuum Butt Cannon.

276
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,416
Man, she dodged.

277
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,666
Guess I'll just have
to try it again.

278
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,791
And this time I won't miss ya!

279
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,250
In that case, let's get
down to business, shall we?

280
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,125
It's time for us to
finish this, Cerbie.

281
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,166
[NOZOMI yells]

282
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,958
They're so fast! It's hard to
tell who's who at this point.

283
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,791
They're both going for
their finishing moves.

284
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,083
I've got you now.
You're goin' down!

285
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,791
I've had enough.
I'm ending this!

286
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,291
[KOTONE, NOZOMI]
Finish her.

287
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,166
Vacuum Butt Cannon!

288
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,208
[KOTONE]
Full-Power Cerberus!

289
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,708
They're even!

290
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,375
Unfortunately for Cerberus,

291
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,375
it can only gain
momentum on the Land.

292
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,208
Meanwhile, the
Vacuum Butt Cannon

293
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,958
gains powerful centrifugal force

294
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,208
thanks to the player's
building rotations.

295
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,208
Fujisaki doesn't stand a chance.

296
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,416
[KOTONE screams]

297
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,666
No way.

298
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,500
[MIKU]
Fujisaki is overboard. Loser.

299
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,250
[MIKU] Class-change race, group
four, winner: Nozomi Kaminashi.

300
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,750
Hell yeah!

301
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,750
Hooray! She did it!

302
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,750
[NOZOMI]
Hey, nice fight, Fujisaki.

303
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,250
I had fun racin' ya.

304
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,416
I hope that we can
do it again sometime.

305
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,625
Whatever. Ugh. I told you.

306
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not interested in racing.

307
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,083
[MAN B] You've been
teasing me all this time

308
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,250
and now you won't do it.

309
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,625
[MAN A]
You know what you have to do

310
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,250
if you want me to
go any further.

311
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,166
[MAN B] I don't know
if I'm ready for that.

312
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,208
Huh? What the--?

313
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,833
I can't hear it.

314
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,500
I was so excited.

315
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,458
I've never felt that way
during a race before.

316
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,041
[KOTONE]
Nozomi Kaminashi, huh?

317
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,416
[NAGISA] First of all, I wanna
say good work, ladies.

318
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,333
Today's races were nail-biters.

319
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,916
It was almost too much
excitement for somebody my age.

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
I know this was a challenge,

321
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,291
but there's something important
I want you all to keep in mind.

322
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:56,458
And that's Setouchi Training
School's motto, "Only Land."

323
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,250
I wonder what that means.

324
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,000
[NAGISA] It's a reminder
that any fighting

325
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,875
between you and your
classmates is only on the Land.

326
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,458
The drama stays there.

327
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,958
Once the race is over, you're
united by an irreplaceable bond.

328
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,041
I know that some of you are
going to be disappointed

329
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,583
with today's results,
but remember,

330
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,833
you tried your best out there

331
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,875
and you should be
proud of yourselves.

332
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,916
Use any negativity you're
feeling to fuel your progress.

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,041
If you do that, then
you're bound to succeed

334
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,500
in the competitive
world of Keijo!

335
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,166
We'll be posting the class
promotion and demotion lists

336
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,250
this evening.

337
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,125
You ladies worked
really hard today,

338
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,750
so we're gonna be nice and
give you the day off tomorrow.

339
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,750
But everyone better
be ready to train hard

340
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,833
when we come back
the day after that.

341
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:38,875
You're dismissed.

Please forgive me!

347
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,708
I'm sorry, Ms. Ujibe,
I know I was out of line

348
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,750
for using the Vacuum Butt Cannon
without your permission!

349
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,875
But I'm begging you,
don't spank me!

350
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,750
Dontcha think my rump's
been through enough?

Uh?

353
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,125
[NAGISA]
Hmm...

354
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,208
[NAGISA] It looks like your
butt's gotten a bit thicker.

355
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,458
You're putting on muscle
in all the right places.

356
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,250
How do your hips feel?
Are you in any pain at all?

357
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,666
Yeah, but nowhere near
like it was before.

358
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,166
Interesting.

359
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,333
I never expected your
hips to get this strong

360
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,208
in a month's time.

361
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,708
If you ask me, this is proof

362
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,208
that you were born
to use the technique.

363
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,083
That said, it doesn't
change the fact

364
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,708
that using it could potentially
ruin your Keijo career.

365
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:38,500
You'll have to decide whether
it's worth the risk or not.

366
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,583
I'll allow you to start training
with the Vacuum Butt Cannon.

I won't let you down, ma'am!

369
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,583
Your UTM really helped me!

[NAGISA]
Good to hear, but listen.

371
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,833
I need you to start taking
the sport of Keijo seriously.

372
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,958
You've gotta learn your
limitations and how to win

373
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,625
without putting unnecessary
stress on your body,

374
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,083
or you'll never make it to pro.

375
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,541
You shouldn't have used
it without asking me.

376
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,875
Uh. I'm sorry.

377
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,041
That probably would've
been a good idea,

378
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,416
but it's not like
I had a choice.

379
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,041
I would've lost without it.

on Setouchi's entire

Well, you see,

393
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,333
I heard that every year
they kick some students out

394
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,291
after the class-change race.

395
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,666
And, um... I did so
poorly on mine today.

I'm sure they're
gonna let me go.

somethin' you gotta see!

You're exactly right.

Ms. Ujibe.

407
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,791
But I must say, I was impressed
by how well you performed

408
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,708
up until the very
end of the race.

409
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,833
You may not've even realized
you had her cornered, Aoba,

410
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,458
but I sure did.

411
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,666
In fact, you forced her to
use a forbidden technique.

412
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,000
"Forbidden"?

413
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,208
Which one did she use?

414
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,083
Titty Hypnosis.

415
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,958
It's a dangerous technique
to use on the pros,

416
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,125
much less amateur Keijo players.

417
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,291
That's why we forbid her
from ever using it at school.
