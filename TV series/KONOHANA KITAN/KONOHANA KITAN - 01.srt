Careful not to

I don't want you
getting lost, okay?

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,750
Right. Sorry. I'll stick close.

Hmph!

This being your
first time in the city,

15
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,958
you must be so curious
about everything.

[YUZU]
Uh-huh!

Look ahead, Yuzu.

look like much.

but since you and I have
known each other a while.

we do things here.

Let's get her started.

You heard her, Natsume.

47
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,458
Go on and get the
new girl all cleaned up.

[groans]
That's just Satsuki for ya.

Don't take it personally.
You'll get used to it.

[YUZU]
So pretty.

big breasts for a small girl.

Or this will take a lot longer.

[KIRI]
Next, we'll get you dressed.

64
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,458
[REN] I've prepared some
kimonos for her that I think

65
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,333
will go well with
her hair and eyes.

You're really on
task, Ren. Excellent.

[YUZU]
Look at her! She's so cute!

68
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,916
And you can call me Ren.

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,250
Good to be working with you.

Why, thank you.

Good to be working
with you, too.

Though it's only
been a few seconds.

[REN]
Ah--

74
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,125
[REN]
Is she serious?

75
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,125
Does she really not understand
a turn of phrase?

00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,625
I was just being polite!

you silly fox?

[KIRI]
Hush now. Just come with me.

84
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,833
Take a look out there, Yuzu.

85
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,791
After the shrine to the
gods, Konohanatei is

86
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,291
the second highest point
in the entire city.

00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,958
So what you see is
a rare privilege

The city's so big,

92
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,875
and there are so many
people down there.

93
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,916
I've never seen
anything like it.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,666
[KIRI] You and Sister Bikuni
always lived way out

95
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,833
on your own, didn't you?

Yes..

Heh.

98
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,791
And now that that's over with.

99
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,291
You'll be partnered up
with Satuski here

100
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,458
till you know the ropes.
Happy working, ladies!

[SATSUKI]
Hold on.

102
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,916
Shouldn't she be apprenticing
under Natsume or Ren?

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why should I be the one?

104
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,208
Oh? Don't think
you can handle it, huh?

105
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,208
If our brilliant Satsuki
isn't up to the task,

106
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,333
what shall we do?

107
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,875
Hey. I never said I couldn't--

108
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,458
I'm sure your
older sister isn't having

109
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,000
any difficulties supervising and
instructing the staff members

[GUEST A] Think we might
be able to eat a little early?

120
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,333
[KIRI]
Of course. Not a problem at all.

121
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,208
An early dinner it is.

122
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,750
[SATSUKI] Hurry up and
finish that. We have guests.

[FURRY GUEST]
Pardon me, ladies.

125
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,333
Is this the way to
the outdoor baths?

126
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,666
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,500
They are located just at
the end of the path there.

128
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,125
Please relax and
enjoy your stay.

129
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,750
Yes. Please enjoy your stay.

130
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,333
Idiot.

131
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,208
Always make sure you're on your
feet when a guest approaches.

132
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,166
Remember, the guests
are what's most important.

134
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,500
So never get in their way.

135
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,458
[YUZU]
Got it. Understood.

136
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,375
[YUZU sighs]

137
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,708
[NATSUME] A big group
of unexpected guests

138
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,375

Wow, that looks a lot cleaner.

141

Oh. Thank you.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,958
But be sure not to
polish it too much,

143
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,416
or you'll slip.

144
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,875
[YUZU]
Huh?

145

[NATSUME giggles]

147
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,750
[YUZU]
I went overboard..

148
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,750
[FURRY GUEST]
Oh, my! What an excellent bath!

149

[YUZU groans]
Are you hurt, sir...?

153
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,916
Is anything broken?

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,916
No, dear.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,791
Are you injured at all, child?

156
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,541
[SATSUKI]
I'm truly, deeply sorry, sir!

157
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,708
We'll let the manager know
what happened and come by later

158
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,458
to make a proper apology.

159
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,000
[FURRY GUEST]
That won't be necessary.

160
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,833
I'm sure the little one there
was hurt far worse than me.

161
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,083
[YUZU] I'm sorry.
That was all my fault.

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,958
Just be more
careful from now on.

163
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,000
Apologizing won't
always fix everything.

164
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,541
[YUZU]
Yes, but...

165
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,166
Shouldn't I tell Kiri and go see
the guest later, by myself?

166
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,250
You're missing the point, moron.

167
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,000
We all share responsibility
for what happens here.

168
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,750
Regardless of who messed up,
I did what needed to be done.

169
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:41,916
[gasps] Okay. Thank you
for having my back.

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,083
[SATSUKI sighs]

171
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,375
You're always so fiercely
independent, Satsuki.

172
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,458
I never knew you had
such team spirit.

173
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,625
I was saving
my own face, not hers.

174
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,208
Where any guests are concerned,

175
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,875
if one staff member
here makes a mistake,

176
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,208
it's everyone's mistake.

177
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,041
I know, someday,
I'll be quitting this place,

178
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,291
but until then, I'll do my job.

179
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,083
[FURRY GUEST]
Truly, I'm fine.

180
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,625
No apologies necessary.

181
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,666
[SATSUKI]
Thank you, sir.

182
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,833
And what about you?

183
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,875
Are you all right?
No broken bones, I hope.

184
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,166
No! I only have a
little bruise on my bottom.

185
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,458
--That's all.
--[SATSUKI growls]

186
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,833
Dear me. You poor girl.

187
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,458
That sounds painful.

188
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,750
[FURRY GUEST]
Here. Use this compress.

189
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,000
It will make you feel better.

190
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,416
That's very kind, sir.

191
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,791
Are you a pharmacist?

192
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,625
[gasps] Please, sir.
You must let us pay for that.

193
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,500
And we'll buy other
medicines as well.

194
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,541
It's the least we
can do as a token of apology.

195
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,208
[YUZU]
Can we afford that?

196
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,583
A token of.. apology?

197
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,041
[SATSUKI]
Yes.

198
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,083
We would like to make amends
by helping your business.

199
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,125
[YUZU] But medicine is to help
the injured or treat the sick.

200
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,250
It's not something you should
buy as a way of apologizing.

201
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,708
--[FURRY GUEST] Actually...
--[gasps]

202
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,083
If you would
like to help my business,

203
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,666
there is something.

204
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,166
[FURRY GUEST] This is
a very special medicine,

205
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,333
used to treat a wide
variety of ailments.

206
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,916
[SATSUKI]
Sugar candy?

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,333
[FURRY GUEST] And I'm
afraid I don't have enough

208
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,541
of the stardust
I need to make more.

209
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,625
Stars are so high.

210
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,541
Could you knock
some down for me?

211
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,791
[SATSUKI]
But that's just ordinary candy.

212
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,666
Does he think we're that naive?

213
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,083
With all due respect,
sir. What you are--

214
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,541
[YUZU]
Of course, sir!

215
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,708
We'll knock some down for
you as soon as it gets dark!

216
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,208
[YUZU gruntin]

217
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,416
Idiot! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

218
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm trying to get some stars!

219
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,916
[grunts]
Almost.

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,791
[SATSUKI]
Shut up and stop it already.

221
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,833
[YUZU yelps]
Just one more!

222
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,250
[gasps]
I got it! Did you see?

223
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,166
I hit it and it fell!

224
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,208
It looked like it landed
out past the mountain.

225
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,375
So all you have to do is
go over there and pick it up!

226
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,625
[SATSUKI snarls]

227
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,375
You moron!
Don't you understand?!

228
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,041
He's just messing with us.

229
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,541
I wouldn't exactly
call it "messing with you."

230
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,541
I would more describe it as
"playfully pulling your leg."

231
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,666
And I must say,
it's been quite entertaining.

232
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,916
Thank you both
for a lovely time.

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,875
Take these for your trouble.

234
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,041
But we haven't
been able to help you

235
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,833
or do what you asked of us, sir.
I cannot accept these.

236
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,791
You have a strong sense of duty.

237
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,250
However, life is more
than just responsibility.

238
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,583
You ought to loosen up and
let yourself have a bit of fun

239
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,541
once in a while.

240
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,875
That medicine is special.

241
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,083
It will help you learn to relax.

242
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,208
[SATSUKI]
Am I really too uptight?

243
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,625
No. He was just a
weird, old pharmacist.

244
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,666
Still. That stupid brat's
quick thinking did save us.

245
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,833
[gasps]

246
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,083
[FURRY GUEST]
That medicine is special.

247
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,583
It will help you learn to relax.

251
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,625
[YUZU] I've never been
in a hot spring before.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,916
[YUZU]
Huh...?

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,208
Hey there.

00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,208
[YUZU yelps]

256
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,041
Watch it! Idiot! Be careful!

257
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,208
[YUZU]
Sorry, Satsuki. I'll try.

258
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,583
It's just...

259
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, this is my first
time in a hot spring sharing

260
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,916
a bath with someone
around my age.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,250
It's new to me.

262
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,416
[YUZU]
And a little embarrassing.

263
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,958
[SATSUKI sighs] You...
You did good earlier, kid.

264
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,083
Our guest seemed to be
very pleased with you.

265
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,458
With me?

266
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,750
But I didn't do anything for
him to be pleased about.

267
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,250
If he gave us praise,
it belongs to us both.

268
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,791
[gasps]
You're sharing it with me?

269
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,250
[YUZU] It's like you said when
I over-polished the floor.

270
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,791
We all share responsibility
for what happens here.

271
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,333
We're a team.
We have each other's backs.

272
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,916
Since now I'm a
part of that team,

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,166
any praise I get is yours, too.

274
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,583
I, uh...

275
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,083
[SATSUKI] I was saving
my own face, not hers.

drown in that hot spring?!

Sorry you had to rescue me...

But, that's yours.

Don't argue with me, dammit.

283
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,333
Just have some and go to sleep.

see us again sometime.

[FURRY GUEST]
Oh, I will.

291
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,041
But for now I'm off to explore
the other side of the mountain.

292
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,875
After all, I do need
to pick up that star

293
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,000
a certain someone
knocked down for me.

294
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,708
No, sir! I was just being silly!

295
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,708
I didn't actually knock
down a real star!

296
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,875
Please don't waste your time on
the other side of the mountain!

297
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,875
It won't be there!

He knows that, dummy.

299

Do I? I'm not so sure.

[SATSUKI gasps]

301
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,708
Perhaps there's a
fallen star over there,

302
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,416
or perhaps there isn't.

303
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,833
I won't know for certain
until I go see for myself.

Goodbye. Safe travels.

This is amazing!

I hope I get the chance
to do it every day!

309

Seeing guests off on new
adventures is wonderful!

00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,583
I'll make you proud,
Sister Bikuni.

311
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,208
I'm going to work
hard here at Konohanatei.

With Miss Kiri, and Satsuki, and
Ren, and Natsume!

Oh, yes! That's Sakura.

introduce you to her.

What's the matter with you?!

321
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,208
Quit slacking off!

322
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,625
If you finish something early,
don't just stand around!

323
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,958
See if there's someone else who
needs help and go help them!

324
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,875
Do as we do, even if
you don't understand it!

--[YUZU] I'm sorry!
--Satsuki sure is noisy as ever.

do I have to tell you?!

[NATSUME]
You don't need to do everything

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,541
that she says, you know?

331
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,875
[YUZU] But Satsuki spends so
much time and energy teaching me

332
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,208
how to do things here.

333
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,833
And she still does all her
own work on top of that,

334
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,291
without missing a beat.

335
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,083
That's why I need
to be strong, learn fast,

336
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,291
and work hard, so I can
stop slowing her down.

337
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,875
You're such a good girl, Yuzu.

338
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,750
[REN] By the way, did you blow
your nose on your obi Natsume?

339
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,916
[NATSUME]
So? Who cares?

340

We're washing it anyway, right?

I care!

[YUZU] You want us
to work with other people?

343
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,083
[KIRI] Uh-huh. Today, Satsuki
will partner up with me.

344
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,250
And, Yuzu, you'll be
teaming up--with Sakura.

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
[YUZU] Uh, it'll be good
to work with you, Sakura.

How nice of you.

work and get better at my job.

There's so much beauty here.

I have to get back to work!

It's like you're magic!

It must be
because you're so fun,

and you find so many
interesting things to do!

all look so different with her.

focused on doing just my work,

that I've been missing

you for a high-quality pillow.

being in here with me,

442

then go and bunk with Natsume.

[BIKUNI] True knowledge, is not
merely what you learn from books

or sitting at a desk
taking lessons.

452
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,000
It also comes from
going out into the world

453
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,041
and learning from
many other people.
