00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,625
[TANABE]
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,916
[REI chuckles]

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,708
[REI] The dream I just had.
You gotta hear it.

164
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,458
So, there was this fox...

165
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,333
That kid's not from
anywhere around here.

166
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,208
He must be a human
who wandered over.

167
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,125
It happens sometimes.

168
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,958
A human?

169
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,750
[YUZU] That must've been
what happened to her.

170
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,916
Humans occasionally
wander in and out.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,166
Most of them don't
even realize it.

172
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,375
He'll find his way
home eventually.

173
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,250
What are those things? Mice?

174
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,916
Ooh! Fluffy!

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,083
Owie!

176
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,875
Watch it! Don't go
around picking on girls!

177
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,000
Hey, let go of me!

178
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,000
What's this shrimpy
guest doing here?

179
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,208
If that kid were a guest,

180
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,750
I would've stopped you
before you hit him.

181
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,458
She's mean!

182
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,541
What's your problem?
I only wanted to play!

183
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,125
Sakura doesn't have
time to play with you.

184
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,208
Unlike all you spoiled,
little, rich kids,

185
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,583
she has a job that
she has to do.

186
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,000
[yelps]

187
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,833
I'm going to have a very
important job when I grow up,

188
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,041
'cause I'm special.

189
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,166
At least, that's
what everyone says.

190
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,208
Everyone?

191
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,875
Dad, Mom, and Mr. Takahashi.

192
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,416
Takahashi? Is he your teacher?

193
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,833
He's the one who first
noticed I was special.

194
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,041
"You're a special one,
Kaito. And smart.

195
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,333
When you grow up, what you
do will be very important."

196
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,166
See?

197
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,666
So I'm not a spoiled kid,

198
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,875
and my work's way more
important than hers.

199
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,458
[YUZU]
But, Kaito.

200
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,500
As someone who is destined
to do great things one day,

201
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,375
shouldn't you be more
respectful of others

202
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,333
who are working hard
in what they do?

203
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,708
How would you feel if
someone belittled your job?

204
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,125
He must've hit a nerve.

205
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,833
I've never seen her angry.

206
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,625
What? This is Yuzu
when she's angry?

207
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,416
How can you even tell?

208
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,666
Sorry for what I said.

209
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,083
[KAITO'S FOSTER MOM]
Kaito!

210
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,000
[KAITO]
That's my mom calling. Later!

211
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,583
What does "later" mean?
Does he plan on coming back?

212
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,291
He disappeared.

213
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,500
That can't have been real.

214
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,500
I must finally be
losing my mind.

215
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,166
Kaito, are you awake?

216
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,541
[KAITO'S FOSTER DAD]
Feel like going for a walk

217
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,208
with your Mom and Dad?

Kaito. You've gotten
so big and fast.

My little boy. You've
grown so much so quickly.

Can't believe today's the day.

So, Kaito! How ya been doing?

and dad did a great job.

Bye, Kaito. Study hard.

I know you're going
to be amazing.

Did you find something?

240

Kaito! What are you doing here?

241
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,833
What's wrong?

242
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,541
[KAITO]
I was at school, and I ran away.

243
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,041
You did?

244
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,250
I wanna go home! I hate it here!

245
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,833
But you can't.

246
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:19,458
That wasn't your real home. And
those weren't your real parents.

247
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,708
It was true! I wasn't theirs!

248
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:26,000
I didn't belong to them,
so I couldn't go home, not ever!

249
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,041
We're very special.
That's why we have to study.

250
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,333
'Cause one day, we'll have
important jobs helping people.

251
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,666
It's the reason
Mr. Takahashi chose us.

252
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,083
[KAITO]
I was chosen.

253
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,958
I didn't have the right
to choose for myself.

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,791
Oh, Kaito.

255
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,625
[KAITO] Come with me!
We can run away together!

256
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,875
I heard that, you brat!

257
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,041
Now you're just being
manipulative. Go!

258
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,458
It's time you went home!

259
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,791
Never! Never! I'm never going
to go back there again!

260
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,166
[SMOKER STEPFATHER] I'm never
going back there again!

00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,416
What the--?

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,875
It's past your checkout date.

263
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,583
You have to go home.
Enough is enough.

264
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,541
I can give you more money.

265
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,333
Go on. Tell me how much
you want, Cat Ears.

266
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,500
What's it gonna take?

267
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,166
I'm a fox, thank you!

268
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,125
And this is in no
way about money!

269
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,541
It's okay. Let me.

270
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,833
[REN]
All right, Kiri.

271
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,458
[KIRI]
With all due respect, sir,

272
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
I need to inform you of
something you're unaware of.

273
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,375
You see, what you call
"money" is nothing more

274
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,750
than worthless paper here.

275
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,791
Now I get it.

276
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,041
When I woke up
after the accident,

277
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:38,125
I couldn't figure out where
I was or why I was here.

278
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,458
I'm dead. And this
must be the afterlife.

279
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,958
Oh, no. You're still
very much alive.

280
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,125
So if you don't mind,
please get out now.

281
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,833
[SMOKER STEPFATHER] Give me a
break, lady! Then I nearly died!

282
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,958
What the hell?
How heartless are you?

283
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,458
My deepest sympathies, sir.

284
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,458
It would seem Hell didn't
want you just yet.

285
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,833
Better luck next time.

286
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,625
You say that like I
failed a job interview.

287
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,125
"Hell didn't want me yet"? Tch.

288
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,125
And besides, even
if I did go home,

289
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,000
I still can't go back
to my old life.

290
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,833
It's impossible.

291
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,416
[KAITO]
I don't wanna go back either.

292
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,333
So I know how you feel.

293
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,750
[YUZU]
Careful, Natsume.

294
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,375
You're throwing him really
high. Don't drop him now.

295
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,291
[SMOKER STEPFATHER] They weren't
your real folks, huh?

296
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,291
And ya didn't like this
school, so you took off?

297
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,041
I didn't know what
being special meant.

298
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,708
I thought I could be
anything when I grew up.

299
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,833
But it turns out my
future is on a track

300
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,125
someone else laid down for me.

301
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,458
That's a rather sophisticated
way of puttin' it, kid.

302
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,791
Me? No track.

303
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,666
I started out as a truck
driver, worked hard,

304
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,125
and managed to end
up the president

305
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,000
of a small transport company.

306
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,333
I had an awesome wife and kid.

307
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,250
Can't say life was
always smooth sailing,

308
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,791
but I couldn't
complain about it.

309
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,041
Then it happened.
I got into an accident.

310
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,291
One wrong move turned
my life upside down.

311
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,875
In the end, we're
all in God's hand,

312
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,583
just dancin' away in his palm.

313
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,500
You seem like a good kid.

314
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,583
You're healthy, able-bodied,

315
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,250
and you've got a bright
future ahead of ya.

316
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,541
Those are all things

I don't have that.

I wasn't theirs.

320
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,583
My mom and dad weren't
my actual parents!

321
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,583
We weren't a real family!

322
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,833
Then we got somethin'
else in common.

[KAITO]
Huh?

324

My daughter isn't my real kid.

My wife had her
before we got married.

She didn't like me
much at first.

327
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,916
Either she was distant
or we'd end up fighting.

328

Teenage girls are
so damn complicated.

You're asking me?
How would I know?

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,333
It took a very long time
for her to accept me

332
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,833
and think of me as her family.

wanna go home?

She's my daughter!

I raised that girl
like she was my own.

337
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,291
I paid a fortune for her to go
to some cockamamie art school.

338
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,208
Now she's out of the house,
enjoying her life,

I vowed to provide for
them and protect them.

I'll be nothing but
a burden from now on.

I was a good husband and father.

If it all ends here, I can
still hold my head up high

and call it a good life.

I can hear her grumbling
even here in Konohanatei.
