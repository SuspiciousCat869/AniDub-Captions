1
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,666
What's the big idea?

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,791
Yuzu's doing well.

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,583
She's gotten pretty
good at her work.

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,750
Therefore, I'm telling
you to go take a break.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,333
You need it. You're enough
of a workaholic as it is.

6
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,291
What does that matter?
It's my choice.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,541
I'm not tired at all.
I am perfectly fine.

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,750
And while I'm on this "break"
who's gonna cover for me?

9
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,166
Your temporary
replacement is not your choice.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,375
[SATSUKI]
Hmph.

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,958
Listen to me.
You are taking tomorrow off.

12
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,958
Satsuki. I understand
how you feel.

13
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,375
But just because you work
yourself especially hard,

14
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,875
doesn't mean you'll get
out of this place any quicker.

[YUZU]
Um, Miss Kiri?

18
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,916
[KIRI]
Hmm?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,916
[YUZU] Is there anything
wrong with, uh, Satsuki?

20
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,875
[KIRI] Just because you work
yourself especially hard,

21

doesn't mean you'll get out
of this place any quicker.

22
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,416
[SATSUKI] I know that.
You didn't have to remind me.

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,416
But... I feel like
the more time I waste,

24
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,833
the further behind her I get.

[SATSUKI gasps]

26
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,833
Hey! What the hell is all this?

27
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,541
[YUZU]
A cherry blossom bath!

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,666
The others said that
this pool was going to be

29
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,375
drained tomorrow morning.

30
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,250
So, I figured why not?

31
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,958
[SATSUKI] I've never had saké
in the hot spring before.

32
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,041
Though Kiri does
it all the time.

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,458
[YUZU]
Why not? Don't you like saké?

34
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, but not at night.

35
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,791
I'm usually busy planning and
preparing for the next day.

36
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,458
Well then, tonight you can
and get a good night's sleep.

37
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,458
[SATSUKI] She's right.
I don't work tomorrow.

38
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,875
Tonight, I don't need to
worry about anything.

39
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,958
[SATSUKI] I didn't realize it
was almost the full moon.

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,583
[SATSUKI]
How'd I miss that?

41
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,708
When did I stop
looking up at the sky?

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,041
Time marches on
no matter what we do.

43
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,041
The Earth goes around the
Sun and the Moon keeps on

44
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,625
going around the Earth.

45
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,000
[YUZU] Everything can
change in a heartbeat.

46
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,666
You have to be careful
not to blink or stare

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,375
at your feet too long.

48
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,416
Otherwise, you could
end up missing it.

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,750
And when that happens,
it's a real shame.

50
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,833
[SATSUKI] It would be
a shame to miss it, huh?

51
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,375
This ancient spring has already
changed several times

52
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,541
while I've stared at my feet.
What else has passed me by?

53
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,208
[SATSUKI] You sure you
want to be putting in

54
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,166
all this work pampering me?
You must be tired yourself.

Oh, it's fine.

00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,666
I've got the day
off tomorrow, too.

Perfect. Then you're
comin' with me.

Huh? Where to?

To town. Where else?

You haven't seen it yet, right?
I'll take ya and show ya around.

And I'll treat you to
something nice as thanks

for the flowers and saké.

[YUZU] But, Satsuki,
you don't have to do that.

72
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,958
Also, I don't have anything
I can wear into town.

73
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,000
[SATSUKI] You can borrow
one of my kimonos.

See you in the morning.

You are unbelievable!

78
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,125
Are you seriously
going to go out in public

79
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,500
with that bedhead, Satsuki?

80
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,791
Who cares? It's my day off.
Why shouldn't I?

81
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,333
[REN] Because it's
completely unacceptable.

82
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,166
Go fix it. And as for you,
that obi's the wrong color.

83
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,625
Come with me.
I'll lend you one of mine.

84
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,916
If there's one thing I
can't stand, it's when women

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,750
are indifferent and don't
care about how they look.

Oh, no. Nothing.

89
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,291
I've just never heard you be so
loud and demanding

90
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,291
before, Ren, that's all.

91
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,333
Ahh! Please pardon me.

92
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,458
A lady must always remain
demure and graceful,

93
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,916
even if her house is on fire.

--Not that I've seen.
--Ren?

101

[YUZU] I get the feeling there
are a lot of different sides

102
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,708
to Ren I don't know about yet.

103

will arrive by six.

[NATSUME]
Got it.

105
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,083
Satsuki is an
attractive young woman.

106
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,500
I wish she'd be more
mindful of her appearance.

107
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,416
And once she's a priestess,
she'll have to be.

108
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,291
It's practically a requirement.

00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,875
Oh. That's right.

You probably don't know.

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,333
Satsuki plans on leaving
the Konohanatei one day.

113
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,250
She wants to become a priestess.

didn't even like Yuzu,

yet you're taking
her out on a date?

121

[SATSUKI] I'm just showing her
around town today because

122

I have nothing else to do,

Yes, boss? What is it?

Understood.

00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,375
They look good.
They smell good, too.

157
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,291
May I have a bite of one?

158
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,625
If you want.

159
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,208
[SATSUKI] I guess most
people do like dumplings.

160
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,750
[YUZU] Would you like
to have some of mine?

161
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,750
Me? Um. Okay.

162
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,458
All right. Here you go.

163
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,208
--[SATSUKI whimpers]
--Try it.

164
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,083
See? The <i>shiratama</i>
is all jiggly.

165
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,583
Isn't it just delicious?

166
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,708
[SATSUKI] Nobody's
staring at us, are they?

167
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
This is a busy town, isn't it?

168
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,125
The temple I used
to live at was remote,

169
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,291
and way out in the mountains,

170
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,583
so I was shocked
when I first saw it.

171
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,250
[SATSUKI]
People don't bother you, though.

172
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,625
You seem comfortable enough.

173
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,000
[YUZU] Lots of visitors
would come to the temple.

174
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,458
All kinds of folks and more
than a few humans, too.

175
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,958
[SATSUKI]
I see.

176
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,916
I was wondering how she knew
so much about human things.

177
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,208
It's not often, but we do
sometimes get humans here.

178
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,375
They really come here?

179
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,250
[SATSUKI] This town is a
stop on a main travel route.

180
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,500
You can expect to see
just about anyone here.

181
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,041
[MOUSE 1A]
Step aside! Coming through!

182
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,916
[YUZU]
I think it's wonderful.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
All the people
passing through here,

184
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,500
with all their own
secrets and stories,

185
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,958
and the adventures
they've been on.

186
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:21,958
It's exciting!

187
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,125
[SATSUKI]
Is it?

188
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,041
Thanks for inviting
me out, Satsuki.

189
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,250
It's a day I don't
think I'll ever forget.

190
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,375
[SATSUKI sighs]

191
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,250
Whatever. I guess that means
you're enjoying yourself?

192
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,625
I am.

193
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,958
[SATSUKI] I just had time
to spare, that's all.

194
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,166
I didn't do anything special.
She didn't have to thank me.

195
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,416
Though I suppose it's
easy enough to say.

196
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,791
[YUZU giggles]

197
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,708
[SATSUKI] So why can't I seem to
say it back to her?

198
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,125
[SATSUKI] Don't go
getting weird ideas now!

199
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,958
[SATSUKI] I've got no problem
saying anything to Kiri.

200
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,291
[KIRI]
Oh, Satsuki.

201
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,500
[SATSUKI] But this girl.
She throws me off somehow.

202
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,458
[MAN A]
Hey, Tome! Long time, no see.

203
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,916
Have the cherry blossoms
bloomed up at the shrine yet?

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,541
[MAN A]
Sadly, no.

205
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,250
Cherry blossom
season came and went,

206
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,833
and the tree never
sprouted a single bud.

207
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,291
I suppose it's just too old now.

208
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,083
Aww. That's such a shame.

209
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,791
I never saw a finer sacred
tree in all my travels.

210
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,375
It was lovely.

211
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,791
So then, where do
you want to go next?

212
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,916
I think I'd like
to stop by the shrine!

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,416
[SATSUKI gasps]
The shrine?

214
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,583
[SATSUKI] There isn't anything
interesting to see up there.

215
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,041
[YUZU] I just wanted to pay
my respects to the local gods,

216
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,375
and I heard something
about a sacred tree.

217
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,000
So, I was curious.

218
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,083
And I want to see
where you'll be working

219
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,333
after you leave Konohanatei.

220
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,041
'Scuse me? After I leave what?

221
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,125
[squeals]

222
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,250
[SATSUKI]
Ren told you, didn't she?!

223
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,041
That big blabbermouth!
She's gonna pay!

224
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,250
[YUZU]
Please! Don't hurt her!

225
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,083
This is my fault!

226
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,708
I know I probably shouldn't
have said anything, but...

227
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,791
Honestly. I think you would
make a wonderful priestess.

228
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,750
I can picture you leading
the ceremonies.

229
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,791
Well, you can forget about that!

230
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,041
Wait, where are you going?

231
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,458
[SATSUKI]
To the bathroom!

232
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,875
I'm really sorry...

233
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,166
[YUZU] What did I say
that upset her that much?

234
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,416
Think, Yuzu, think!

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,750
[SATSUKI]
Listen up.

236
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,458
Stay right there.
Don't move, or you'll get lost.

237
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,416
[YUZU] Even when she's mad,
she still worries about me.

238
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,458
She's got a kind heart.

[GHOST GIRL grunts]

[YUZU]
Hey, are you okay?!

241
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,416
[GHOST GIRL]
Thank you for your help.

242
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,666
I was with my sister,
but we got separated.

243
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,916
Have you seen her?

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,791
I've been looking for her
for five days now.

245
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,916
[YUZU]
Five days?

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,666
She and I still have so much
work we have to do.

247
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,333
This is such a predicament.

[YUZU]
Oh, no!

00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,500
Um... I'd like to
help you look for her,

250
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,083
if that's okay with you.

251
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,875
[GHOST GIRL]
I'd be very grateful. Thank you.

252
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
[YUZU] Sorry, Satsuki.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

253
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,958
I promise.

254
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,250
[SATSUKI] Guess I should
head back to Yuzu.

255
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,958
[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER]
Hey! You there! Girlie!

[SATSUKI]
No matter how irritated I was,

257
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,208
I shouldn't have snapped at her.

[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER]
I'm talking to you.

259
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,041
[SATSUKI] She's young,
and new, and she didn't know.

--I could've cut her some slack.
--Hey, Girlie! I'm lost.

Show me where to go.

262
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,416
[SATSUKI]
And it being Yuzu,

263
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,833
she'll pretend she's forgotten
about it when she hasn't.

264
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,166
Don't act like you
don't hear me, Girlie.

Damn. This brat won't go away.

You do not get to
call me "girlie."

Why, you--!

That's no way to talk to
a poor, lost, little soul.

270
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,250
If you keep being mean
to me, I'll throw a fit!

271
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,916
I'll roll around on
the ground and cry,

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,583
until everyone in town knows
how horrible you are!

273
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,000

00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,875

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,666
Glad you understand.

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,000
[SATSUKI] Sorry, Yuzu. I'll
buy you a maneki-neko later.

280
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,791
So, where exactly
do I need to take you?

281
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,583
To go find my older sister.

282
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,750
Then you're a "lost child"?

283
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,291
Don't say it like that!

284
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,291
When my sister wasn't looking,
I went off to have some fun,

285
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,583
and now I can't get home.

286
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,125
[SATSUKI]
Then you deserve to be lost.

287
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,333
You're gonna end up alone in
life pulling stunts like that.

288
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,791
[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER]
That was uncalled for.

289
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,666
And... there was more to it.

290
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,166
I was tired of my big sister
constantly teasing me

291
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,708
just because I'm younger.

292
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,791
It's not fair.

293
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,791
I'm not a little baby anymore.

294
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,958
Yeah. Older sisters
do tend to be pretty selfish.

295
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,125
That's right! Do you have
an older sister, too?

I beg to differ.

298

[BYSTANDER 2A] I'm sorry. I
haven't seen anyone like that.

That's too bad.

Thanks anyway. Sorry to trouble
you. I'm not from here.

don't know the area.

That's quite all right.

Nevertheless,
I appreciate you trying.

Where were you headed to?

305
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,875
Maybe we can look there.

306
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,916
To the north.

from the southernmost point,
slowly northward.

309
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,333
All the others we were traveling
with have already gone on ahead.

310
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,958
My younger sister
and I fell behind.

311
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,125
What? Aren't you worried that
you need to catch up to them?

312
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,375
[GHOST GIRL]
A little, but not really.

313
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,750
Throughout the years,

314
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,458
this journey has been
undertaken countless times.

315
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,916
[GHOST GIRL] Better to try
and stay calm, then to panic.

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,708
One can never outrun
the passing of time.

317
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,291
That's beautiful and very wise.

318
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,833
[REN] Satsuki should be more
mindful once she's a priestess.

319
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,125
[YUZU] I was sad when
I first heard that,

320
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,750
but it's not like
we're parting for life.

321
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,500
There's still so much
I don't know about this city

322
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,083
and its people,
about Konohanatei,

323
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,250
and about my new friends
that I work with there.

324
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,583
But I want to learn
as much as I can,

325
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,416
and grow to love
it all even more.

326
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER] So, you
think we'll be good friends,

327
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,083
or maybe best friends?

328
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,791
[SATSUKI]
Would you shut up already?

329
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,208
[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER]
What's your older sister like?

330
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,708
Does she act like the world
revolves around her?

331
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,916
[SATSUKI]
Definitely.

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,083
She's self-centered
and tactless,

333
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,250
and really great at
everything she does.

334
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,041
[HIIRAGI] I have no interest
in becoming a priestess.

335
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,666
Let Satsuki do it.

336
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,833
Serving the gods
is her dream, not mine.

337
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,541
She's awful. A terrible person.

338
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,500
Wow. My sister may not
think about others,

339
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,000
but she's not that bad.

340
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,375
[SATSUKI] Good grief.
Can I just smack her?

341
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,333
I like you a lot more
than my sister.

342
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,833
What if you come
north with me instead?

343
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,833
[SATSUKI]
No way!

344
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:25,916
Why not?

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,291
Serving the gods
is noble and dignified.

346
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,541
[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER]
And not just any gods,

347
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,666
like the local ones
of a small town.

348
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,833
We serve the gods
of Takamagahara.

349
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,500
Ensuring the well-being of
Nakatskuni also falls to us.

350
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,875
It's important work.

351
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,333
You could give your sister
a run for her money.

352
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,875
[SATSUKI gasps]

353
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,500
[SATSUKI'S DAD] We'll send
Hiiragi to work at Konohanatei.

354
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,541
[SATSUKI'S MOM]
But dear, she's the eldest,

355
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,958
and she has so many gifts,
everyone expects her

356
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,625
to become a priestess.

357
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,791
[SATSUKI'S DAD]
You're right.

358
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,333
Satsuki should go
to Konohanatei instead.

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
I've got you now.

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
[SATSUKI gasps, screams]

361
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,416
[CROWD screamin]

362
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
What's going on?!

363
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,250
Where did this
sudden wind come from?!

364
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,666
I don't know!

365
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,375
[YUZU whimpers]

366
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,250
I know where she is.

367
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,291
By the sacred tree.

368
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,125
[GHOST GIRL'S SISTER] If I make
the cherry blossoms bloom,

369
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,000
my sister will finally
see what I'm capable of.

370
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,375
I wasn't able to do it before,

371
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,916
all by myself, but now
I have someone to help me!

372
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,958
[SATSUKI]
Wait a sec! Help how?

373
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,833
You're not planning to use
me as fertilizer, are you?

374
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,541
[YUZU pants]

375
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,916
[SATSUKI]
Somebody? Anybody?

376
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,625
Flowers of the sacred tree.

377
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,958
Blossom!

378
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,375
[YUZU gasps]

379
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,875
[YUZU gasps]

380
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,375
It just bloomed!

381
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,041
[BLOSSOM VIEWER A] The sacred
tree has flowered at last!

382
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,833
This calls for a celebration!

383
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,541
A banquet, too!

384
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,750
Satsuki! I found you!

385
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,666
[YUZU] I was worried you might
be stuck in the bathroom

386
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,000
and missing all this!

387
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,125
[SATSUKI]
Yup. There you go again.

388
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,833
Acting like I was
never mad at you

389
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,666
and nothing even happened.

00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,083
Are you all right?

392
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,791
Yeah. I think so.

393
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,625
You should've pulled
me down more carefully.

00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,625
[AYAME]
Satsuki?

395
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,500
[YUZU]
It's one of the priestesses.

396
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,625
Ayame.

397
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,333
Well, this is a surprise.

It's not very often that
I get to see you here.

How are you?

00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,708
Yeah, uh, I'm fine.

find you a seat right up front!

[SATSUKI]
Hold on a sec, Ayame!

403
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,500
[AYAME] Don't worry.
I'll make sure I snag one

404
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,500
for your little friend, too!

405
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,625
[YUZU]
Hey! Wait for me!

406
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,791
What's wrong?

407
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,375
Oh. I was with somebody
looking for her younger sister.

408
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,375
Her sister?

409
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,750
Yeah, it's awful.

410
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,166
She said she'd been
looking for her for five days.

411
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,500
It seemed like she
really needed help.

412
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,208
I'm sorry I moved.

413
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,333
No, don't be.
I kinda did the same thing.

414

[YUZU]
Huh?

415
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,041
And anyway,
they found each other.

00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,291
[YUZU gasps]

417
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,500
[SATSUKI] See the one
with the silver hair?

418
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,791
[YUZU]
Huh?

419
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,875
The pretty priestess
over there in the middle.

420
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,083
[YUZU]
Ah.

421
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,208
Believe it or not,
that's my sister.

422
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,291
She was going
to work at Konohanatei,

423
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,041
but she's older than me,
so I went in her place.

424
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,375
They chose her to be
a priestess over me.

425
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,583
[YUZU gasps]

426
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,083
But I haven't given up
on serving the gods.

427
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,041
Once my job is done,
I'll try to join a shrine again.

428
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,166
And I'm self-conscious
about this,

429
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,083
so keep your mouth shut.

[YUZU gasps]

431
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,791
[YUZU]
She's such a good person.

432
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,958
Satsuki's kind,
and a little awkward,

433
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,000
and she doesn't like to talk to
people about herself that much.

434
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,708
Yet she told me
something very personal.

435
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,416
[YUZU whimpers]

436
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,000
[YUZU] She trusted me
enough to confide in me.

437
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,333
I never knew something like
that could make me so happy.

Hey. What's wrong?

00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,875
Why are you crying?

440
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,250
I'm so glad...
that I came to Konohanatei,

441
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,625
and got to meet everyone there.
Especially you, Satsuki.

442
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,625
I'm just...
so happy we're friends!

00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,250
Come on.

444
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,666
There's a banquet
in the main hall tonight

445
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,875
and they'll need us.
So, let's get back to work.

446
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,833
All right.

447
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,791
[YUZU] Ever northward,
two sisters travel.

448
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,333
Leaving only footsteps and
cherry blossoms behind.

449
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,750
They're on their way,
so let us go home,

450
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,083
back to our Konohanatei.
