[YUZU gasps]

3
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,875
[YUZU]
You startled me.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,625
Good morning, sir.
Welcome to Konohanatei.

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,333
May I get your bag for you?

6
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:33,083
Sir? Hello? Where
are you going, sir?

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,541
[KIRI]
Don't worry about him.

8
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,125
He's going to find Sakura.
He's one of her regulars.

9
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,083
You sure I shouldn't offer him
some tea or anything like that?

10
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,500
No. They're all right.
Best leave them to it.

11
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,666

[squeals]

13
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,250
[KIRI] Lately, he comes
here just to see Sakura.

14
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,416
He enjoys spending
time with her.

15
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,375
[YUZU] So he likes the
kind of hospitality

16
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,708
only Sakura can provide?

17
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,333
[KIRI chuckles]

18
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,125
Yes.

19
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,375
And speaking of regulars,

20
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,958
some of Ren's will
also be arriving today.

21
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,791
Go help her greet them.

22
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,750
Yes, Miss Kiri.

23
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,708
[YUZU] I wonder what
Ren's regulars are like.

24
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,333
[REN] Oh, Princess,
your hair smells divine!

25
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,166
[IMAGINARY GUEST A] You
noticed? It's my new perfume.

26
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,666
[YUZU]
Probably something like that.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,583
Oh, my! Look at you.
Are you new here?

28
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,583
Uck. She's the plainest
fox I've ever seen.

29
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,041
Perhaps we should
give her a makeover.

30
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,916
Yuzu's a work in progress.

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,750
And she's sensitive,
so please don't tease her.

32
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,958
Goodness! We didn't mean
to tease the poor girl.

33
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,250
[GODDESSES]
Much.

34
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,583
We think she's
absolutely adorable!

35
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,416
[REN]
Yuzu, these are my regulars.

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,958
They're gods of entertainment.

37
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,208
Aren't their outfits
and makeup fabulous?

38
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,375
[REN giggles]

39
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,041
You both look amazing!
Just like always!

40
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,583
Originally, there was
supposed to be

41
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,458
a third member of our
party joining us today.

42
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,458
But she had a local festival,
so I'm afraid she's a no-show.

43
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,291
How nice for her.

44
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,500
To be a local god in a town
where she still matters.

45
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,833
Nobody bothers to make
any offerings or pray to us

46
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,166
except at New Year's.

47
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,333
These days, people
only call on the gods

48
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,625
when they're in trouble.

49
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,583
[BOTH]
"Help me!"

50
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,833
[GODDESS GUEST A]
Back in the old days,

51
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,833
there were festivals
all the time.

52
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,583
Tons of different gods got
invited to the mortal world.

53
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,958
[GODDESS GUEST B]
So true.

54
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,666
Ah, the good old days.

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,583
Since Konohanatei
sits on the path

56
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,166
between heaven and
the mortal world,

57
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,000
it was right smack dab in
the middle of all the action.

58
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,500
The place used to be packed!

59
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,333
Oh! You should've seen it!

60
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,000
Do you know why they
stopped having

61
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,625
as many festivals, Ren?

62
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,708
I don't.

63
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,166
You two are gods.
Do you know why?

64
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,708
We have no idea how the
mortal brain works,

65
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,750
but there are several
Western celebrations

66
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,875
that now seem to
be all the rage.

67
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,541
[GODDESS GUEST B] That
Halloween thing where children

68
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,541
dress up as ghosts and
ghouls is rather popular.

69
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,375
Goddess, that would
be perfect for you.

70
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,041
You wouldn't even
have to dress up.

71
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,916
Speak for yourself, Sister!

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,333
[GODDESS GUEST B chuckles]

73
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,333
Well, hello, Sisters.
Long time no see.

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:29,458
[GODDESS GUESTS chattering]

75
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,875
[GODDESS GUEST A]
We should have our own festival,

76
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,791
the three of us!

77
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,083
[REN gasps]

78
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,375
[REN] Ladies, wait! You're
rooms are actually this way!

79
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,833
Ladies?

80
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,750
[WOMAN]
Sounds wonderful, Sisters.

81
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,666
Are they gone yet?

82
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,916
Where have you been?

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,125
And why were you hiding
in the break room?

84
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,916
Those sisters are a
bit too fond of me,

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and they like to kiss me
until my whole face is wet.

86
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,458
But anyway, you seen
Sakura around?

87
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,458
She seems to have ditched
her chores and disappeared.

88
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,208
One of her regulars is here.

89
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,375
Last time I saw her, she was
playing in the garden with him.

90
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,875
The master's here?

91
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,666
Yay! Then tonight I'm gonna
ask him to teach me kendo!

92
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,958
He's a kendo master?

93
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,958
Kiri didn't say anything
about him at all.

94
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,458
[NATSUME]
Well...

95
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,083
He's an old battle god.

96
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,708
And since there
haven't been many wars

97
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,208
in the mortal world lately,
he's got a lot of spare time.

98
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,250
[GODDESS GUEST A]
Back in the old days,

99
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,166
there were festivals
all the time.

100
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,166
Tons of different gods got
invited to the mortal world.

101
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,375
[GODDESS GUEST B] These days,
people only call on the gods

102
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,125
when they're in trouble.

103
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,375
[FORMER BATTLE GOD]
Hmm...

104
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,625
[gasps]

105
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,375
[YUZU] Wait! You don't
have to do that, sir!

106
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,541
I can go to the tool shed

107
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,833
and get you a hatchet
and a small knife!

108
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,625
Please don't damage
your precious sword!

109
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,541
It'll only take me a s--

110
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,166
It's all right. Don't worry.

111
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,916
Unless I do something with it,

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,125
the blade will remain in its
sheath and will only rust.

113
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:20,708
Besides, if it's not carved by
a katana, it won't fly as well.

114
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,500
[GODDESS GUEST A]
Fantastic! What a...

115
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,625
[GODDESS GUEST B]
Wonderful!

116
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,208
[GODDESS GUEST A]
Almost as good as the old days!

117
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,250
Natsume, get up there
and dance for us.

118
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,708
Or I'll have to kiss
that adorable face.

119
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,750
[NATSUME yelps]

120
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,416
Okay. I'll do my
fish-scooping dance.

121
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,000
Could you take a few more?

122
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,083
[laughing]

123
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,208
[GODDESS GUEST A, NATSUME]
And scoop, and scoop,

124
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,458
and scoop, scoop, scoop, scoop!

125
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,541
[GODDESS GUEST A]
Not so...

126
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,500
[WOMAN]
Seeing the place like this...

127
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,875
...makes me feel like I'm
back at the old Konohanatei.

128
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,708
[gasps]

129
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,916
You're the guest who came
in after Ren's two regulars.

130
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,875
[YUZU] Years ago, did
Konohanatei used to always have

131
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,291
big, loud parties like this?

132
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,875
Yeah.

133
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,458
The mortal world was a lot
livelier back then, too.

134
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,083
Sure, there were wars
and other hardships,

135
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,125
but the gods would come visit
far more often than they do now.

136
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:59,458
This inn was the place to be.
It was a grand old time.

137
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,125
Well, I can't say anything about

138
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,166
what Konohanatei was
like in those days,

139
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,958
because I wasn't there...

140
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,125
...but it's still
a special place,

141
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,583
and there are some things
we can offer our guests now

142
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,291
that back then we couldn't.

143
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,416
[WOMAN]
Huh.

144
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,916
You've grown pretty
wise, little fox.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Who'd have thought?

146
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,416
And if it's all
about the service,

147
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,625
you'd best get a move on.

148
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,250
[gasps] Yeah!

149
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,291
[GODDESS GUEST A] What, no fish?
You need to scoop some more.

150
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,375
I'm very disappointed
in you, Natsume.

151
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,000
They must be drunk.

152
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,666
We've opened three whole
barrels of saké just for them.

153
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,625
Satsuki, who is she?
Do you know her?

154
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,416
[SATSUKI]
The woman in the dark kimono?

155
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,708
No, I don't.

156
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,500
Didn't she come with
Ren's regulars?

157
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,250
[GODDESS GUEST B] Hello,
we're out of saké over here!

158

Yes! I'm on it!

Thank you for staying
with us again.

Until next time. Safe travels.

No idea. I thought
she was a guest.

familiar, though.

watch me put on my makeup?

I finished all my chores,
so there's nothing left to do.

We're going to have

A very large group of them.

How large a group
you talking about?

193

It seems like we're
getting a lot of gods lately.

[NATSUME] New Year's is
a very busy time for gods.

of giving everyone
their assignments.

Stay on your toes.
It'll be pretty hectic.

No. There's nothing
wrong. I'm perfectly fine.

And besides, why do you
keep calling me "Okiku"?

It's not my name.

Just because you say it doesn't
mean that's what it is. Jeez.

[OKIKU] I think I'll
go to town for a bit.

I know they don't want me going
too far from Konohanatei.

00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,208
Urinosuke and I found
you in the trash,

229
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,625
and decided to bring
you home with us.

have to do something

about those shabby
clothes of yours.

there are all these foxes.

do whatever you ask.

guests here today.

You and Sakura need
to not be in the way

that important.

a bigger issue.

00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,958
Even curse the humans
to your heart's content.

314
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,833
What? Curse humans?

315
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,500
Does that mean you hate them?

316
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,541
Of course! I hate every
last one of them!

317
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,166
I was made by a
master craftsman,

318
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,750
supposed to be
a family heirloom,

319
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,958
and my humans went
and ditched me

320
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,166
for some dumb mass-produced
hunk of plastic!

321
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,916
So I put a curse
on that ugly thing

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,958
so it would forever be
losing one of its shocks

323
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,458
and one of its shoes!

324
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,583
You hid that doll's shoe
and sock, didn't you?

325
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,625
Curse the humans!

326
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,125
May they get leg
cramps every night,

327
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,458
which force them
to get out of bed

328
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,125
and walk the halls till
dawn! May they be...

329
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:13,500
Okiku, nobody's ever played
with you, have they?

330
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,583
That's why you're still
so pretty, isn't it?

331
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,750
No child has ever touched you.

332
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,958
Look at me.

333
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,875
My body's all
cracked and beat up.

334
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,333
The color on my arms
is faded from the sun.

335
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,916
And my shoes were lost long ago.

[LILY'S OWNER giggling]

338
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,291
But each scratch and
chip is precious.

339
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,833
They're memories
I share with her.

340
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,458
But she... she threw
you in the trash.

341
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,833
That's what happens at
the end of a doll's life.

342
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,416
[LILY] Eventually, all children
discover something they like

343
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,458
more than playing pretend.

344
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,250
They find someone they like
more than their dolls.

345
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,916
They grow up.

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,708
As dolls, our entire purpose
is to be a child's friend.

347
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,791
So when they're
no longer children,

348
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,000
that's the end of our life.

349
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,833
Bye. I have to go now.

350
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,875
What? Where are you going?

351
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,250
'Cause you don't have
to go anywhere, ever.

352
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,416
You're free now.
Don't ya get it?

353
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
You can stay here.

354
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:47,291
I'm sorry. I wish I could
be your friend, but I can't.

[SATSUKI]
Snow.

356
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,750
No wonder. It's been so cold.

357
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,000
Autumn was long, but
Winter's finally here.

358
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,458
[REN] Why are you sitting
around sulking?

359
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,083
I'm not sulking.

360
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,500
Are you still mad that
I wouldn't make you

361
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,541
a new dress earlier?

No. That's not it at all.

I've been working
on it for days.

366
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,166
That's the only reason I said

367
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,250
I wouldn't make you
something earlier.

368

Understand?

369
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:56,416
Okiku, nobody's ever played
with you, have they?

Come on. Why are
you crying, Okiku?

Cheer up.

My name isn't Okiku.
Please stop calling me that.

Okay. Fine.

When did it get thrown out?

I don't know.

trash without asking me.

[LILY'S OWNER]
Oh, Lily. Thank goodness!

382
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,166
[BOYFRIEND A] That doll's
pretty old and beat up.

Yeah, she is.

I've had her ever
since I was a kid.

to me for Christmas.

Nope.

We're gonna get
her some new clothes.

been lonely without me,
