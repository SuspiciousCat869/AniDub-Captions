1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:10,166
[pounding]

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,541
[YUZU] Are those <i>taiko</i>
drums I keep hearing?

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,458
It's coming from town.
Today is the Yoimiya Festival.

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:17,708
A festival?

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,583
Sister Bikuni used to
tell me all about those!

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,333
[REN] What? You mean you've
never been to one before?

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,541
[YUZU yelps]

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,166
[YUZU] Well, I know
what happens at them.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,166
Like how there are huge floats,
horses climbing up steep cliffs,

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,666
tons of yummy things to eat,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,375
and lots of people
running towards the gods

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,125
as fast as they possibly can!

13
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,208
[REN]
You've, uh, mixed some stuff up.

14
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,041
[NATSUME]
But that's the general idea.

15
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,333
Indeed.

16
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,375
And once the daytime
festivities are over,

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,166
everyone dances and
sets things on fire.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,625
[SATSUKI]
Kiri, you're not helping.

19
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,166
Well, then that settles it!

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,166
Today we're all gonna take Yuzu
to her very first festival.

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,125
[REN] Is our work going
to magically do itself?

22
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,875
Our guests are all going
to the festival themselves,

23
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,333
so I think we can
figure something out.

24
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,375
If you split into two
groups and take turns,

25
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,875
it shouldn't be a problem.

26
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,291
The boss and I will remain
here, as will Okiku,

27
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,500
so we'll be covered.

28
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,958
You sure?

29
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,625
You don't mind us leaving
when it's not our night off?

30
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,458
Come on, Ren, just go!

31
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,083
Besides, it won't be
any fun without you.

32
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,041
I guess.

33
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,875
I mean, if Kiri says it's okay,
and everyone else is going...

34
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,958
Thanks, but I'll pass.
Festivals don't interest me.

35
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,375
Well, you have to go.

36
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,666
[SATSUKI]
Huh?

37
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,041
[KIRI]
If you stay behind,

38
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,875
then Sakura and Yuzu
will be wandering around

39
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,458
the festival all by themselves.

40
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,500
And I can't send them
with Ren or Natsume

41
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,916
because their guests
are coming back earlier.

42
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,541
Bye! See you in a few hours.

43
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,791
[KIRI]
Mh-hm.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,041
All right, ladies,
let's get some work done.

45
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,208
Then when those three return,

46
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,291
you two can go to
the festival for a bit.

47
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,458
[REN]
What about you?

48
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,250
Are you sure you don't
wanna come along?

49
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,625
I'm too old for <i>bon</i> dances

50
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,625
and all that
fattening street food.

51
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,875
[NATSUME]
Yeah? How old are you, Kiri?

52
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,041
Yep. I'm done.

53
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,541
I've been to more
than enough festivals.

54
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,916
Did you hear me?
I asked how old you are!

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,958
[KIRI] I've already got lots
of happy summer memories.

56
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,666
You girls go make
some of your own.

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,166
[NATSUME]
Kiri! How old are y--?

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,583
[KIDS laughing]

59
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,916
[YUZU]
Look at this place!

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,958
So many people and things to do.

61
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,000
It's nothing like
what I imagined.

62
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,416
I'm sure it's not.

63
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,333
Wait! Sakura, slow down!

64
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,875
If you don't, you might
crash into some--

65
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,333
Are you all right, Yuzu?

66
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,708
[YUZU]
Yeah.

67
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,041
[YUZU]
Huh?

68
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,625
No, Sakura, wait for me!

69
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,666
You can't run off on your own,
otherwise you might get lost!

70
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,125
Wow! That's the biggest
stuffed squid I've ever seen!

71
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,000
The three of us couldn't
possibly finish it.

72
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,500
What do you think, you guys?

73
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,916
Should we get it and bring
the rest back for the others?

74
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,000
I can't find them!

75
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,833
Sakura and Satsuki went
missing and it's all my fault!

76
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,250
We're right here.

77
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,125
My, what adorable
little fox children.

78
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,625
This way nobody's
getting lost.

79
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,916
[SATSUKI]
I am a grown up, not some kid.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,708
I don't wanna hold hands.

81
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,416
[YUZU]
Satsuki.

82
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,875
What is it?

83
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,500
You bought me <i>shiratama</i>
last time we were in town,

84
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,125
so now I'd like to
buy you something.

85
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,958
[SATSUKI]
Okay. Get me that.

86
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,875
You look so cute.
Now you have four ears.

87
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,375
[SATSUKI]
And no one will recognize me.

88
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,583
These sugar animals
are works of art!

89
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,750
I don't think I could actually
bring myself to eat them!

90
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,083
[YUZU]
That reminds me.

91
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,166
We should get a little something
for Miss Kiri and the boss

92
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,666
since they couldn't come.

93
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,541
Any idea what kind of
gifts they might like?

94
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,041
Well...

95
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,708
[MAN B] That's fantastic!
Filthiest story I ever heard!

96
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,041
[YUZU] While I'm sure
they would like that,

97
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,541
maybe we should
get them something

98
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,208
a bit more sentimental.

99
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,708
[drumming]

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,083
Are they getting ready
to start the <i>bon</i> dance?

101
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,583
Yeah.

102
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,333
It's a very old folk dance
meant to welcome the spirits.

103
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,333
Since today is the day
when souls come back

104
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,125
from the afterlife.

105
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,250
They say the souls get here
by riding fast horses,

106
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,541
but when they go back,
they take slow oxen,

107
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,708
so they have a chance
to enjoy the scenery.

108
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,500
Wow! That sounds so fun!

109
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,833
Satsuki?

110
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,125
I want to join the dance.
Will you come with me?

111
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,750
You go ahead.

112
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,291
But I'll pass.
Dancing's not for me.

113
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,625
Well, what about you?
Do you wanna dance?

114
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,833
[YUZU] So many people,
most of them total strangers,

115
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:14,750
all gathered by a wooden tower,
going around and around.

116
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,375
[YUZU]
It's almost hypnotic.

117
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,750
I feel like there
might be people

118
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,208
from the afterlife
dancing with us.

119
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,666
[YUBABA]
Oh, hush.

120
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,041
There may be some grey in my
fur, but I'm not that old.

121
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:30,916
[CROW MAN A chuckles]

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,250
Sincerest apologies.

123
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,333
Uh. Oh, my. Who is that girl?

124
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,583
So humiliating.

125
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,333
I was made by a
master craftsman,

126
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,791
and now, I'm nothing but a
busboy. Why can't someone...?

127
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,291
[YUBABA]
Our new trainee.

128
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,958
She's been through a lot,
and now she's staying with us.

129
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,708
[CROW MAN A]
Ah. But isn't she a--?

130
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,875
[YUBABA]
Yes. She's a doll.

131
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,000
A priest was asked
to cleanse her soul,

132
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,041
but he left her here instead.

133
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,750
I can see why. One can get
very clean in a hot spring.

134
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,666
She's getting better, though
the edges are still rough.

135
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,583
So we can't let her
stray too far just yet.

136

Four more hot sakés, please.

Sure. Coming right up.

138
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,708
[OKIKU] Is it just me or are
there fewer people here?

139
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,416
Where is everybody?

140
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,208
Oh, they're all at the festival.

141
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,166
[OKIKU] So everyone else gets
to go to the festival, but me?

142
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,541
[KIRI] It's not that you won't
ever be allowed to go.

143
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,333
Just, right now, the boss
thinks it might be dangerous.

144
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,000
Dangerous in what way?

145
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,541
[KIRI]
You haven't been here very long.

146
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,416
You're vulnerable.

Vulnerable?

148
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,250
You think that just because
I'm new I'm gonna break?

149
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,500
This is discrimination!

150

I'll sue you and
everyone in this hotel!

151

It's your soul we're
concerned about.

152
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,291
Souls like yours tend to get
taken to the other side.

153
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,000
[OKIKU]
Taken where?

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,208
[YUZU]
Huh?

155
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,458
The tower seems to have
gotten so far away.

156
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,291
How did that happen?

157
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,333
And where did all these
extra people come from?

158
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,916
Excuse me. Where are you going?

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,291
[SPIRIT A] Back to where
we came from of course.

160
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,958
That smoke will get us to the
oxen who will take us there.

161
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,500
But we have to hurry
before the gate closes.

162
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,000
You, too, young lady.

163
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,833
[YUZU]
But I can't go.

164
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,791
[YUZU] The place they're
going isn't where I belong.

165
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,583
I can feel it.

166
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,500
[YUZU] My home is with
the people I love.

167
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,125
[LONELY GIRL A]
Yuzu!

168
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,208
[LONELY GIRL A]
What are you doing?

169
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,958
You shouldn't be
following us. Turn back!

170
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,166
Your home is that way.

171
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,250
If you go straight,
you won't get lost again.

172
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,000
Thanks for the directions.

173
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,958
That's very kind of you.

174
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,458
[LONELY GIRL A]
I'm just returning a favor.

175
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,625
Wish we could talk more,

176
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,333
but I have to get
going and so do you.

177
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,250
[LONELY GIRL A]
Bye! See ya later, Yuzu!

178
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,208
Dammit, where did she
wander off to this time?

179
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,208
[SATSUKI]
You're late! It's time to go.

180
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,000
We've gotta get home.

181
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,041
Hello?

Satsuki?

184
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,416
Oh, sorry I'm late!

185
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,958
I was dancing by the tower
and then I got lost.

186
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,083
How do you get lost
going around in circles?

187

I've got no idea.

00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,625
[YUZU]
I wasn't scared, though.

189
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,500
There was a kind soul who
helped me find my way back.

190
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,875
[SATSUKI]
What?

191
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,416
[YUZU] I wonder if she'll be
back next year. I hope so.

192
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,833
[SATSUKI]
You go help Kiri with the guests

193
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,333
still in the banquet hall.

194
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,833
I'll head to the kitchen.

195
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,083
[YUZU]
Understood.

196
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,583
Okiku?

197
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,708
Didn't you wanna go to the
festival with Ren and Natsume?

198
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,166
Hmph. Festivals are stupid
and I hate crowds.

199
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,833
I prefer celebrations that
are more quiet and dignified.

200
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,166
[YUZU giggles]

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,291
[REN] It's just like
the last time we came.

202
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,500
I wore new sandals
and a new yukata.

203
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,166
And I kept checking
the mirror to make sure

204
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,416
every hair was in place
and that I was prettier

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,625
than all the other girls.

206
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,958
Why didn't I learn
my lesson back then?

207
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,041
[BOY B] Whoa! Look at
him go! He's awesome!

208
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,708
[REN] It doesn't matter
what I wear or do to myself.

209
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,625
She won't notice.

210
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,875
I don't get it.

211
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,083
We've been coming here

212
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,791
since we were little
and nothing's changed.

213
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,208
I am so hungry!

214
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,333
[REN] Haven't we outgrown
this kind of thing?

215
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,166
Aren't there more mature
ways to have fun?

216
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,750
[MAN D]
Come on, baby.

217
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,666
Hey, Ren, want some candy?

218
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,916
I think it's a bit too
soon for that, don't you?

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,833
Yeah. You're right.

220
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,958
Dinner first and then dessert.
So let's eat some <i>takoyaki</i> !

221
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,333
[REN] This feels like
last time more and more.

222
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,750
I got all dressed up back then,
too, and she didn't notice.

223
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,750
She was so excited and
distracted, she left me behind.

224
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,333
It made me really upset,

225
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,333
and I went home without
even watching the fireworks.

226
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,125
So I have memories
of summer festivals,

227
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,375
just not any good ones.

228
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,750
Whoa! That stuffed
squid is huge!

229
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,125
How long do you think
it would take me

230
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,333
to eat the whole thing?

231
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,875
[REN]
But I'm an adult now.

232
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,000
Stupid stuff like that
doesn't bother me anymore.

233
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,958
[NATSUME]
Ren! Quick! Over there!

234
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,458
They've got a shooting range!

235
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,625
[laughs] Come on!

236
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,875
[REN]
I hope my hair's okay.

237
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,416
It took me a long time to braid
it and pin it up like this.

238
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,708
[REN] These new sandals
are really chafing me,

239
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,250
but we can't leave yet.

240
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,291
[KIRI] I've already got lots
of happy summer memories.

241
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,375
You girls go make
some of your own.

242
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,458
[REN]
I've gotta stick it out.

243
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,250

244
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,333
What's wrong?

245
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,666
Are you having fun?

246
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,333
Yeah, of course I am.

247
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,416
You are?

248
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,666
Because you've been so quiet

249
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,375
and haven't gotten
excited about anything.

250
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,750
It sure doesn't seem like it.

251
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,083
[REN]
Well, if you see I'm unhappy,

252
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,375
try being more considerate!

253
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,791
After all the effort
I went through,

254
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,750
would it kill ya to say,
"Hey, you look nice tonight"?

255
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm doing my best to
put up with you here.

256
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,958
If you don't like it,
go drown in your stuffed squid!

257
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,875
But it wouldn't be
ladylike to say that.

258
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,375
Just a little tired
from walking, that's all.

That's really it?

What are you afraid of?

261
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,291
Put your back into those swings!
Or it'll sound terrible!

262

are practically naked!

Of course she's amazing.

Great. My hair is coming undone.

And my feet are all
blistered and red.

I know I do my hair

and dress up in pretty new
clothes for my own sake.

It's been so long.

00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
This reminds me of last time.

315
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,250
[NATSUME]
Your sandals.

316
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,333
They scraped up your feet

317
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,625
so you went home
early, remember?

318
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,750
When I saw that you
were wearing new ones

319
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,333
like you did back
then, I got worried.

320
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,833
[NATSUME] We can take a
break if you're in pain.

321
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,750
Just let me know, okay?

322
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,000
[REN]
Okay.

323
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,000
Tamaya!

324
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,916
[SAKURA]
Kagiya!

325
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,916
[gasps] Wow.

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,083
Aren't the fireworks pretty?

327
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,958
Yeah.

328
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,291
So these are fireworks, huh?

329
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,375
They're beautiful.

330
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,250
Hopefully next year we
can see them up close.

331
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,916
Would you like that, Urinosuke?

332
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,916
[URINOSUKE oinks]

333
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,541
[REN] I'm all right
now. Let me down.

334
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,083
But won't your sandals hurt?

335
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,375
Eh. I'll just walk barefoot.

336
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,083
[REN]
The ground feels so warm.

337
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,375
Even this late at night,

338
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,958
the heat's still baked
in from the day.

339
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,250
Well, then we'd better enjoy it.

340
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,416
Come on. Let's go.

341
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,541
[NATSUME]
Ren! Wait!

342
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,416
Ren, what's wrong?
You disappeared.

343
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,750
Nothing's wrong, Natsume.

344
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,416
My sandals were just
hurting my feet, so I left.

345
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,750
Well, then I'll leave, too.

346
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,958
But if you go, you'll
miss the fireworks.

347
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,583
I'll see 'em later. Uh?

348
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,416
Come on. Let's go.

349
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,625
Hey, what's with the
ground? It's still warm!

350
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,791
Maybe 'cause it
was so hot today?

351
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,541
[NATSUME]
Yeah. That makes sense.

352
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,458
Why'd you take your
sandals off, Natsume?

353
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,708
[NATSUME chuckles]

354
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,166
[NATSUME] Because going
barefoot feels so good!

355
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,791
[REN] I don't wanna
go home. I'll be lonely.

356
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,625
Once I get home,
she'll go somewhere else.

357
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,416
[NATSUME]
Do your feet still hurt?

358
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,708
[REN]
Uh-uh.

359
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,041
[REN] I wish we didn't
have to say goodbye.

360
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,333
I wish we could go home
to the same place.

361
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,333
[NATSUME]
So, you all right?

362
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,916
[REN]
Yeah. I'm all right.

363
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,583
[BOTH]
Let's go home.

364
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,041
That's good!

365
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,791
Shochu's fine, but nothing beats
cold saké on a hot night.

366
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,708
Hm? What's that, Sakura?

367
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:37,625
Is it a gift?

368
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,208
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

369
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,250
[gasps]

370
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,666
What is it? I wanna see.

371
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,333
[KIRI]
Hmm...

372
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,250
[KIRI]
Yoink!

373
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,750
What could it be?
It smells sugary.

374
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,333
Ahh...

375
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,791
A squid?

376
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,916
Really? It's not?

377
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,083
Did you have a fun time
at your first festival?

378
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,875
[SAKURA]
Mh-hm.

379
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,625
And in the midst of all
that joy and excitement,

380
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,333
you still got me a gift.

381
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,875
Thank you. That means a lot.

382
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,458
Try some. You've never
had it, have you?

383
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,708
Ha.

384
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,458
You'll get cavities if you eat
sugar before you go to bed,

385
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,625
so be sure to brush your teeth.

386
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,000
Huh. I think I've
seen this before.

387
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,208
Hmm... Then again, maybe not.

388
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:03,583
See you later. I really hope
you come back next year.

389
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,958
And now, time for bed.

390
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,541

Goodnight.
