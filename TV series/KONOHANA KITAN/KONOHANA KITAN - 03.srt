I was one of the best.

be fair to the others.

It was so funny.

I scared Ren and
she screamed and--

[REN]
Don't blame it on me!

00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,583
Inappropriate conduct
will not be tolerated.

161
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,125
Please leave quietly,
as she requested.

162
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,083
Otherwise, I shall be forced
to bar your entire party

163
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,041
from ever returning to
Konohanatei again.

164
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,666
The decision is yours, sir.

165
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,708
Barred from here forever?

166
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,250
[GUESTS]
Leave! Right now!

167
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,625
[gasps]

168
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,416
[KIRI] Don't let the door hit
you on the way out.

169
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,458
Goodbye!

170
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,750
[GUEST C yells]

171
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,208
[REN] I dislike
drunk men to begin with,

172
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,208
but no matter how rude he was
I shouldn't have made a scene.

173
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,916
Don't let it bother you, Ren.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,041
He deserved it.
He was in the wrong.

175
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,125
[YUZU gasps]

176
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,333
Um... Hello,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

177
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,291
I'm Yuzu, and I would like to
dance for your enjoyment!

178
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,416
[REN gasps]

179
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,875
Sure! You can dance for us!

180
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,041
Good idea! I'll come dance, too!

181
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,250
Excellent! Let's get everyone
back in a party mood!

182
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,875
[NATSUME, YUZU]
Dance. Dance.

183
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,291
Dance, dance, dance, dance!

184
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,041
[KIRI]
Looks like fun. Wanna join them?

185
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,375
[gasps] No. Dancing for
the guests is beneath me.

186
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,625
In other words, you're
saying you've got two left feet.

187
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,708
[gasps]

188
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,375
No single person
can handle it all.

189
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,166
If each of us could
do everything ourselves.

190
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,291
We wouldn't ever
need to ask for help,

191
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,958
and we wouldn't have
friends to help us.

192
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,666
Now, then. I think
I'll pour some saké.

193
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,416
[REN whimpers]

194
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,333
There, there, Ren.
He's gone now.

195
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,458
You're okay. You're okay.

196
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,625
[gasps]

197
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,666
[NATSUME]
There, now. All clean.

198
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,000
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

199
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,166
You scared me, ya know that?

200
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,583
[NATSUME]
When I first saw you,

201
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,041
I thought you were the
prettiest girl I'd ever seen.

202
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,750
I thought you were a
fairy, and might cast a spell.

203
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,583
[REN] You said almost the
same thing I'd been thinking,

204
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:53,500
so I couldn't say it back.
But somehow, I didn't need to.

205
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,916
I knew I wanted
you to notice me,

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,416
and as long as I was beautiful,
you always would.

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,625
Thanks again, Natsume.

208
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,083
I should thank Yuzu,
too, for dancing.

209
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,333
And try to give tonight's
guests my happiest,

210
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,500
most heartfelt send
off just like she does.

211
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,333
[REN] I should also thank the
boss and the others for having

212
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,583
my back, and getting
things done when I was upset.

213
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,916
I'll get up early tomorrow
and do extra cleaning.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,250
As for you.
When you open your eyes,

215
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,250
I hope I'll be even
more beautiful than

216
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,250
when you closed them.

217
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,375
[REN]
Absolutely not!

218
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,291
No! I refuse to sit and watch
while practically naked men

219
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,750
grapple with each other.

220
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,916
Picturing such brutishness
makes me shiver.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,708
That's a pretty
narrow-minded view.

222
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,708
[SATSUKI]
What's narrow-minded?

223
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,833
What are you talking about?

224
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,208
Hey, Satsuki!

225
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,166
You want to go to the
sumo match with me tomorrow?

226
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,583
[gasps]

227
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,958
[SATSUKI] No way. I see
your ugly mug enough at work.

228
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,750
Why would I want
to see it on my day off?

229
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,833
[NATSUME]
Uh, ouch. Come on.

230
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,083
[REN] Well, at least I don't
have to worry about anything

231
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,541
ever happening between
Natsume and Satsuki.

232
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,208
They fight like they're sisters.

233
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,458
I'd be happy to spend
my day off with Natsume,

234
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,375
if we were shopping
or something.

235
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,583
[KIRI] Ren! There you are.
Hurry up! We have guests.

236
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,708
Coming, Kiri.

237
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,916
I'm Ren and I'll be
taking care of you.

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,458
Welcome to Konohanatei.

239
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,083
It's been quite a while
since we've been

240
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,958
to a hot spring, hasn't it?

241
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,625
Oh, my, yes. I'd say
a hundred years at least.

242
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,291
[REN]
What a cute little old couple.

243
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,125
Oh? Is that your grandchild
over there, all in blue?

244
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,083
[GRANDPA A]
Indeed it is. That's Aoi.

245
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,291
One of our great,
great grandchildren.

246
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,416
[GRANDMA A] No, dear,
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

247
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,875
Aoi is one of our great, great,
great, great grandchildren.

248
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,083
Aoi came along to keep
the two of us company.

249
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,666
Such a sweet child.

250
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,541
[REN]
How precious. I'll get her.

251

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,333
[REN]
Natsume!

255
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,041
If it's all right.

256
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,833
Can Natsume be the one
who takes care of me?

257
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,708
Please, Grandmother?

258
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,291
[REN]
That brat!

259
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,416
[GRANDPA A] The view here is
absolutely stunning.

260
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,583
[GRANDMA A]
It certainly is.

261
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,833
[GRANDPA A]
I'm so happy we came.

262
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,583
[REN] Konohanatei
gets mostly older guests.

263
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,666
I can't believe I let
my guard down.

264
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,958
If a cute girl like that
liked Natsume,

265
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,416
would she like her back?

266
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,458
[NATSUME]
Don't worry Aoi.

267
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,916
You'll be bigger
before you know it.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,583
[REN] Bigger? Why do you
care about getting big?

269
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,583
[REN coughs]

270
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,333
You seem to be having fun.

271
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,208
What are you talking about?

272
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,541
[REN] She's not even
going to talk to me?

273
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,125
By the way, Natsume.

274
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,666
Who were you
fighting with earlier?

275
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,958
It was sumo wrestling.
Not a fight.

276
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,958
Whatever it was.
That's not the point.

277
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,708
[REN]
What if that man was a guest?

278
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,166
What if you'd injured him?

279
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,541
You shouldn't be
so rough with people.

280
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,041
But, Natsume is awesome, though.

281
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,583
So strong and fast.

282
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,791
Really?

283
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,208
You flipped that huge guy like

284
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,125
he barely weighed
anything at all.

285
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,916
I think you're totally amazing.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,041
Aw, shucks. You'll embarrass me.

287
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,916
[laughs]

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,416
About tomorrow-- Hey, Ren!

289
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,416
Guess she must not
have heard me.

290
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,125
Can we go to town?

291
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,083
Tomorrow. If you don't
already have any plans,

292
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,458
would you take me somewhere?

293
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,500
[REN gasps]

294
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,166
Yeah, sure.
Tomorrow's my day off.

295
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
[REN]
They're going out?

296
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,208
Just the two of them alone?

297
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,750
[REN]
Do something, Kiri!

298
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,416
That guest is taking up
far too much of Natsume's time.

299
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,791
No work is getting done!

300
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,833
You mean your work?

301
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,041
No, Natsume's!

302
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,375
[KIRI]
Even so...

303
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,625
[GRANDPA A]
My joints are sore.

304
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,958
[KIRI] A young person
probably would get bored

305
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,750
just sitting in the hot
spring with an old couple.

306
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, I see
your point, but still.

307
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,875
You're not actually
worried about Natsume's work,

308
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,333
are you, Ren?

309
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,541
Try being a little
more honest next time.

310
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,041
[NATSUME] All right. I'm gonna
take Aoi to town for the day.

311
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,833
[laughs]
Goodbye, Grandmother!

312
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,041
Goodbye, Grandfather!

313
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,833
Be good, Aoi, and don't
you give Natsume

314
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,458
any trouble now.

315
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,625
Bye, Ren. See ya later!

316
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,000
[REN]
Hmph.

317
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,291
Oh?

318
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,000
[REN]
Why did I do that? I'm terrible.

319
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,458
[YUZU]
Ren? Are you okay?

320
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,458
[REN]
Hm?

321
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,875
You're not smiling
and seem kinda down.

322
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,375
I haven't the faintest
idea what you mean.

323
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,125
If there's anything
bothering you,

324
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,125
you know you can
talk to me about it.

325
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,500
[REN sighs]

326
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,750
[REN] Yuzu's the
last person I'd go to,

327
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,291
but I've gotta tell someone.

328
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,916
Um, my friend...

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,708
She's got a problem,
and it's really bothering her.

330
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,791
[YUZU] So it's not your problem,
it's your friend's?

331
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,000
[REN] You see, she's
got this old friend that

332
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,125
she's been really close
to since they were little.

333
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,375
But now there's this new
girl that just came along,

334
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,833
and she completely
adores the old friend.

335
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,500
The old friend
and this new girl talk

336
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,375
and hang out together.

337
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,458
That's all, but my friend
is beginning to feel

338
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,041
really jealous of the new girl.

339
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,541
She feels guilty for
resenting the new girl, though.

340
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:00,041
So I told her to
stop and get over it.

341
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,875
[YUZU] Are you sure your friend
actually resents this new girl?

342
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
What if what she's
feeling isn't guilt?

343
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,166
What if she's actually sad?

344
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,166
[gasps]

345
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,541
Um... Well, you see...

346
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,250
Let me explain with this
yummy steamed bun

347
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,208
that I've been saving.

348
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,875
[REN]
What?

349
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,333
[YUZU] It's my last one,
and I'm really looking forward

350
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,625
to eating it.

351
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,416
[YUZU] But what if somebody
came and stole that bun?

352
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,750
[YUZU gasps]

353
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,000
You're mean, Sakura!

354
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,791
[YUZU] Anyone would be
upset by that. Even me.

355
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,916
I might be angry for a
second or two at the person

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,625
who took the bun and ate it.

357
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,666
But the thing is, I wanted
to eat the steamed bun.

358
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,250
So I'd be more sad
and disappointed

359
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,291
that I couldn't have it.

360
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,875
Then, if it were you,
you'd be sad?

361
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,958
I would. Very sad.

362
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,375
So instead of scolding your
friend and making her feel worse

363
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,250
for resenting the new girl,

364
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,125
I think maybe it's better
to comfort her and support her,

365
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:57,000
so she won't feel so sad about
something she can't control.

366
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,083
[gasps]
Are you crying?

367
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
Oh, no! I'm sorry, Ren!

368
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,583
Please forgive me!
I didn't mean to make you cry!

369
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,125
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

370
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,583
Should I not have said that?
Was it a bad story?

371
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,458
[REN] You're really frustrating,
you know that?

372
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,625
[YUZU]
Eh?

373
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,291
[REN] Stop saying
"sorry" all the time.

374
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,041
[YUZU]
Hm?

375
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,541
Still, thank you.

376
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,041
[gasps]

377
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,541
[sighs]

378
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,833
[REN]
She's nice. Weird, but nice.

379
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,000
Maybe your friend should
tell her old friend how

380
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:28,583
she really feels and not keep
her emotions so bottled up.

381
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,500
What do you mean,
"how she really feels"?

382
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,208
Oh, like she's sad, ya know?

383
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,125
And, maybe that she's feeling
left out and could use

384
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,125
some more attention?

385
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,541
[REN gasps]

386
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,833
Have you gone
completely insane, Yuzu?!

387
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,583
That would come off as
totally needy and annoying!

388
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,416
But Ren, Natsume would
never be annoyed with you.

389
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,125
[YUZU gasps]

390
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,375
[blows landing]

391
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,333
[YUZU whimpers]
I'm sorry.

392
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,041
[REN] I should've known
that wouldn't work.

393
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,583
[REN]
"How I really feel," huh?

394
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,916
We'll see.

395
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,666
[REN] Natsume's already
back from town?

396
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,541
[REN]
Hey, Natsume, it's Ren.

397
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,166
[NATSUME]
Good. Harder. Harder!

398
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,375
Could I maybe talk to you?

399
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,791
[AOI] You mean like this?
Is this better?

400
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,083
[REN gasps]

401
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,708
[screams]
Get away!

402
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,791
Natsume's mine!

403
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,416
Hands off, Aoi!

404
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,041
[REN]
What? The little brat is a boy?!

405
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,083
[screams]

406
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,125
Please! Look away!

407
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,041
Ren. It's not polite to stare.

408
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,833
Me? I'm the impolite one?

409
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,333
What? What is going on?

410
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,000
[NATSUME] Aoi wants to become
a great sumo wrestler someday.

411
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,583
That's his dream.

412
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,708
I'd half given up.
I thought I was too small.

413
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,083
But then I saw Natsume,

414
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,250
and I realized it
wasn't hopeless.

415
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,291
Even someone as skinny
as me had at least a chance.

416
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,458
Natsume's been so encouraging.

417
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,041
He's like the big brother
I never had.

418
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,125
So please, Natsume, teach me.

419
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,458
I know I can do it
if you're my coach.

420
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,000
[REN]
Uh, hang on.

421
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,583
Before this goes any further,
let's go over a few details.

422
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,833
[AOI]
Huh?

423
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,666
First off, Natsume is
actually a girl.

424
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,458
Oh... What...?!

425
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,416
And I'm not sumo coach.

426
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,125
That's the main reason I agreed
to take you into town, Aoi.

427
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,875
So you could meet and talk
to a real sumo wrestler.

428
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,125
[REN sighs]
Get it, now?

429
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,125
[gasps]

430
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,708
Oh. I misunderstood.

431
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,250
Sorry. Also, I've never really
talked to any girls before.

432
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,416
[REN]
So he wasn't ignoring me either.

433
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
He's just shy.

434
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,250
That's a relief.

435
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,166
Serves me right for
getting ahead of myself.

436
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,916
Huh? Oh, yeah.

437
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,166
[NATSUME]
I got ya a little something.

438
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,416
This is the comb
you wanted, right?

439
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,666
I tried to
double check with you

440
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,333
yesterday before you left.

441
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,791
But you didn't seem
to be able to hear me.

442
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,833
[sighs]
Sorry about that.

443
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,166
Thanks, Natsume.

444
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,833
[AOI sighs]

445
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,625
[NATSUME]
Ah. There's the smile.

446
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,666
[REN]
Ah?

447
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,333
I haven't seen it
since yesterday.

448
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,583
You've been so down.

449
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,625
You were in a bad
mood this morning, too.

450
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,000
When we were leaving, you
wouldn't look me in the eye.

451
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,041
I mean, hey.

453
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,083
Not liking sumo wrestling is one
thing, but we are still friends.

454
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,333
Ah?

455
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,083
Please join me next time.

456
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,000
I was sad not seeing your face.

457
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,416
[gasps]

458
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,791
[YUZU] Maybe your friend,
should tell her old friend

459
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,291
how she really feels.

460
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,291
[REN]
Hey.

461
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,375
[gasps]

462
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,541
I was lonely.

463
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,250
I missed you, too.

464
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,041
Ah. Really? It wasn't just me?

465
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,416
[REN]
Mm.

466
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,208
[NATSUME]
See ya in a bit.

467
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,625
I'm gonna go take a bath.

468
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,041
[REN]
Honestly, Yuzu.

469
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,791
Again with your obi.
You're greeting our guests!

470
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,083
[YUZU]
Sorry. I'll keep trying.

471
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,666
I'm pretty sure none
of our guests would notice

472
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,750
one loose obi.

473
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,833
Nope. You're wrong.

474
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,583
Girls must be beautiful. Always.

475

[YUZU whimpers]

476
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,875
Sure. Whatever you say.

477
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:31,958
[REN]
Hey, Yuzu.

478
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,041
[gasps]

479
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,041
Thanks for today.

480
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,041
Ah?

481
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,125
What?

482
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,791
Never mind. Forget it.

483
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,791
Now come on.
Turn around and face front.

484
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,875
[YUZU whimpers]

485
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,250
[SATSUKI]
Idiot.

486
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,625
[YUZU]
I'm very sorry.

487
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,083
[NATSUME]
Aoi? Whatcha doin'?

488
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,166
[gasps]

489
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,916
[AOI] Ren is a really pretty
young woman, isn't she?

490
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
And once you get
to know her a little bit,

491
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,583
she's sweet and good-natured.

492
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,125
And wonderful, and perfect.

493
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,125
And not for you.

494
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,791
And not for... me?!

495
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,583
Ren isn't for you.

496
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,791
Why not, Natsume?

497
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,083
Is she already dating
someone else?

498
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,625
You think she won't like me?

499
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,000
[NATSUME]
Oh, no, particular reason.

500
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,291
She's just not.

501
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,083
Because I said so.
