I think I know
what I'll call you.

00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,000
From now on, your name is Yuzu.

7
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,041
[KIRI] Once upon a time
there was a very lonely girl.

8
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,291
She didn't have any
family or friends,

9
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,083
and spent all her
time by herself.

10
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,916
She did everything she
could to try and make friends,

11
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,625
but the other girls excluded
and shunned her.

12
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,291
Not one soul really
cared about her.

13
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,333
[LONELY GIRL]
Why won't anyone love me?

14
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,333
Is it me?

15
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,333
Am I not good enough?

16
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,208
Is it something I can change?

17
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,625
Or should I just
become someone else?

18
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,916
[KIRI] And so she decided
to erase herself.

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
[crashing noise]

20
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,833
She believed it was the
only way she could become

21
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,750
a different person.

22
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,416
[LONELY GIRL]
Hey, guys, look!

23
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,416
That girl you
didn't like is gone.

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,541
Is this better?

25
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,416
Can we be friends now?

26
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,333
[LONELY GIRL (MONSTER)]
Why are you running away?

27
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,125
Didn't I fix it?

28
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,333
Please, just love me a little.

29
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,875
Then we can be together,

30
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,500
and you can become
this way, too.

Sorry, boss.

00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,833
[YUBABA]
Ugh.

38
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,666
Don't they realize that
staying up this late

39
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,333
will ruin their complexions?

40
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,958
She got us good, didn't she?

41
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,208
The boss is five times
as scary at night.

42
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,166
[KIRI]
Should we call it, then?

43
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,416
And go to bed.

44
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,916
That was so much fun.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,708
Satsuki and Okiku
should have come, too.

46
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,833
They really missed out.

47
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:44,875
[KIRI]
What is it?

48
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,916
[NATSUME]
Uh...

49
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,166
There are five of us,
but six shadows.

50

You guys know what's going on?

57
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,625
The lights went out
all over the building!

58
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,708
[NATSUME]
Yeah!

59
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,166
We were all telling
scary stories,

60
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,791
and then a real ghost showed up.

61
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,833
Can we please
not talk about that?

62
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,833
[KIRI]
All right, ladies.

Mysterious shadows aside,

00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,958
we still have a hotel full
of guests to take care of.

65
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,958
So let's split up and
make sure everyone's safe.

Got it.

Satsuki. Oh, that's right.

00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,375
Don't give me that look!

70
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,500
I can handle it.

71
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,750
[SATSUKI] Yuzu and I
will take the first floor.

[YUZU]
Uh, sure.

If we see a ghost, you kill it!

[NATSUME] But wouldn't it
be more fun to catch it?

Just get going.

[LONELY GIRL (GHOST) laughs]

77
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,166
It's really quiet, huh?

78
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,583
When I was little,
sometimes I'd nap too long

79
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,125
during the day and then not
be able to sleep at night.

80
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,166
[SATSUKI]
Huh?

81
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,041
[YUZU] But it got lonely
being awake by myself,

82
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,000
so I asked Sister Bikuni
to stay up with me.

83
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,333
[BIKUNI] When the grandfather
clock strikes twelve,

84
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,833
that's when today ends
and tomorrow begins.

85
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,666
[YUZU] You know how you
go to bed one day,

86
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,958
and then when you
wake up in the morning

87
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,125
it's "tomorrow"?

88
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,500
[SATSUKI]
I think once you've woken up,

89
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,500
then the day is "today."

90
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,541
Exactly.

91
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,166
"Tomorrow" suddenly
becomes "today"

92
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,250
and we hardly ever notice.

93
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,750
So what?

94
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,375
I don't get it.
Where does tomorrow come from?

95
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,708
Is there someone whose job
it is to switch out the days?

96
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,791
[YUZU] I thought it was a
strange and impressive trick.

97
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,875
I felt like I had unlocked
a great mystery

98
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,041
and seen one of
our world's secrets.

99
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,750
On a night like tonight,
when the moon is full.

100
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,583
I feel like there's
another secret out there

101
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,208
just waiting to be revealed!

102
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,333
Sister Bikuni.

103
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,916
Isn't that the woman
who raised you?

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,416
She's a human, right?

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,333
Yeah.

106
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,583
She adopted me.

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,083
[SATSUKI]
So you're adopted.

108
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,333
[SATSUKI gasps]

109
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,750
Is something wrong?

110
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,541
You're kinda cutting off
the circulation in my hand.

111
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,875
No. Nothing's wrong.

112
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,666
Uh, you sure about that?

113
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,875
You're not afraid of ghosts
or anything are you?

114
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:08,916
No!

115
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,000
If you say so.

116
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,875
Stop being stupid. Come on.

I'm not afraid of them at all!
Not one bit!

[YUZU]
Aw. Poor thing. She's shaking.

127
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,208
It'll be okay.

128
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,750
[YUZU] Satsuki's always so
strong and commanding,

129
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,208
but she's got her fears, too.

130
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,000
No. Of course you're not.

131
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,375
And that's all right.

Are the two of you cuddling?

It's not what you think!

Give me that!

00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,208
Hey. Get up, Yuzu.

137
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,833
We've got guests to check on.

138
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,375
What the heck is so funny?

139
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,250
[YUZU giggles]

140
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,166
Oh, it's nothing much.

141
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,208
[YUZU]
I was right.

142
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,750
There was another secret.

143
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,791
On special nights,
when the moon is full,

144
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,375
who knows what you'll discover!

145
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,208
Hey. Have you guys seen Ren?

146
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,583
We got separated.

147
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,250
We haven't. Sorry.

148
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,000
[sighs] Not good.

149
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,791
She was so scared
she told me not to let go

150
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,708
of her hand, but uh...

151
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,125
[REN]
Remember, Natsume.

152
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,500
Don't you dare let go
of my hand, okay?

153
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,666
Yeah, sure.

154
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,541
And walk a little
bit slower, will you?

155
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,916
You're going too fast.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,958
Okay.

157
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,708
[REN] I said slow down.
You didn't have to stop.

158
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,750
What is it?

159
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,875
[REN gasps]

160
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,833
Tell me.

161
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,750
Do you love me, Ren?

162
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,166
Whoa, do I love you?

163
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,166
Why on earth would you ask
me that here in the dark?

00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,250
[YUZU]
I'm sorry, Sister Bikuni.

324
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,458
I promise I'll be more careful.

325
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,750
And I'll work even
harder from now on.

326
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,541
So please, let me stay.

327
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,500
Please don't make me leave you!

328
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,250
[crying]

329
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,041
Now, why would I make you leave?

330
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,458
I'm slow and always
messing things up.

331
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,000
So you're going to send me
away because I'm useless!

332
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,041
[crying]

333
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,000
Take a look outside, Yuzu.

334
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,708
Do you think the flowers on
that tree there are useless?

335
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,958
No.

336
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,625
Flowers are pretty and
they have a nice smell.

337
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,916
They can also soothe
a troubled mind.

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,458
Excellent, that's right.

339
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,125
But the flowers'
appearance and scent

340
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,000
isn't there for our sake.

341
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,125
The blossoms and
nectar attract insects

342
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,916
so the plants can propagate.

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,708
The flowers themselves have
no idea they ease our minds

344
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,250
and make us smile.

345
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,916
They're worth more
than they know.

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,458
This is too complicated.
I don't understand.

347
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,625
Perhaps you forgot
what you said.

348
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,291
Didn't you tell me that if
you served the Inari shrine,

349
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,916
no one would make fun of you?

350
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,166
[BIKUNI] I thought if serving
there would give you

351
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,208
more confidence,
it might be a good idea

352
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,083
for you to go.

353
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,208
However, I don't
think you're ready.

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,958
So as far as I'm concerned,
you are not going anywhere.

355
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,000
All right?

356
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,625
[crying]

357
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,958
[YUZU]
I love you, Sister Bikuni!

358
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,500
[crying]

359
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,750
[CHONMAGE] Past those hills,
there's a large town

360
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,333
along a trade route.

361
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,666
And high atop a mountain there
is a wonderful hot-spring hotel.

362
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,166
[BIKUNI] Are you perhaps
referring to Konohanatei?

363
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,458
Yes, I am indeed.
Do you know of it?

364
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,375
Actually, I know
the place's boss.

365
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,958
She happens to be an old friend.

366
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,875
I've only been there one time.

367
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,375
But wow. It was incredible.

368
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,500
Thank you, dear.

369
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,208
Is this that little
fox child you adopted

370
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,375
way back when?

371
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,666
[BIKUNI chuckles]
Yes.

372
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,166
She's grown up.

373
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,583
And she reminds me of the foxes
that work at Konohanatei.

374
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,291
They all looked to be
around the same age, too.

375
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,416
There are foxes there
the same age as me?

376
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,625
[CHONMAGE] During a conversation
with the Head Manager,

377
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,791
I said "It must be tough,
dealing with different guests

378
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,291
every day."

379
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,375
[KIRI] But all those guests
are what make it enjoyable.

380
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,875
Let's say it's been
years since your visit,

381
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,750
and you're tired or in pain,

382
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,583
yet you still think back
on your time here

383
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,500
like a wonderful dream.

384
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,250
That means Konohanatei
has become a part of you,

385
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,083
and will remain etched
in your heart forever.

386
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,333
If I can help you
make such a memory,

387
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,083
I consider it an honor.

388
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,250
And there's nothing
that makes me happier.

389
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,291
[CHONMAGE]
So she said.

390
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,583
[YUZU] Past those hills
and high atop a mountain.

391
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,833
Yuzu. Yuzu!

392
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,750
I'm sorry. I got distracted.

393
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,583
Could you please repeat that?

394
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,125
[BIKUNI] True knowledge is
not merely what you learn

395
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,750
from books or sitting
at a desk taking lessons.

396
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,833
It also comes from
going out into the world

397
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,625
and learning from others.

398
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,500
And you'd be able to
do that at Konohanatei.

399
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,708
You really mean it?

400
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,375
[YUZU]
I can go to Konohanatei?

401
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,500
You may.

402
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,791
Remember what I said
about the flower?

403
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,416
You are all those flowers.

404
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,291
You're worth more to me
than you will ever know.

405
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,916
That's why I'm sending
you out into the world.

406
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,125
[YUZU crying]

407
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,458
So you can bloom
even more beautifully.

408
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,083
[YUZU]
Oh, Sister Bikuni!

409
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,708
[YUZU]
Whoa.

410
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,708
Was I just dreaming,
even though I'm standing up?

411
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,666
I've waited patiently.

412
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,083
Give me an answer.

413
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,958
Who is it that you love?

414
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,833
[YUZU]
Lots of people!

415
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,625
Sister Bikuni, the people
who came to the temple,

416
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,000
the guests and staff
at Konohanatei,

417
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,041
and everyone I've met
since I've worked there.

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,708
Had there been a
simple twist of fate,

419
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,500
I might never have gotten
the chance to meet

420
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,291
any of them.

421
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,125
But I did meet them, and
I'm so grateful that I did.

422
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,125
To me, it feels like a miracle.

423
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,541
And today, the person
I got to meet was you.

424
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,291
If only I'd gotten to meet
you a little earlier.

425
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,291
[YUZU]
Is that a boat?

426
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,750
Are you coming?

427
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,875
Next stop: The fields
of eternal happiness.

428
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,333
Yuzu.

429
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,666
If I didn't want to let go
of your hand right now,

430
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,750
would you come?

431
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,458
[YUZU] Sure. I'd cross
the river with you,

432
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,791
and then come back.

433
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,791
[SATSUKI (GHOST)] Sorry for
taking a peek at your memories.

434
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,083
[YUZU]
You did?

435
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,750
Yeah, a little.

436
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,333
I hope next time I can
be a flower like you.

437
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,791
Let's meet again, okay?

438
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,791
[YUZU]
Absolutely!

439
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,125
And with a smile like that, I'm
sure everyone will love you!

440
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,000
[YUZU]
You're perfect as you are.

441
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,833
You don't need to
be someone else.

442
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,416
[KIRI]
Oh. Really?

443
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,583
And that's why you didn't
come back till morning, huh.

444
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,000
[YUZU]
Uh-huh.

445
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,958
I gotta say, you have way
more guts than I thought.

446
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,666
How come you're not
afraid of ghosts?

447
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,958
Ghosts?

448
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,500
What do you mean?

449
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,125
Oh! Are you talking about
how she could shape shift?

450
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,791
Yeah. She was pretty
good at that, wasn't she?

451
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,541
[SATSUKI]
Uh, no.

452
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,833
That girl was dead.

453
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:45,958
She was a ghost.

454
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,875
An evil spirit. Get it?

455
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,541
Yeah. You had a
bit of a close call.

456
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,333
You know that river she
almost took you across?

457
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,750
Yes?

458
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,875
Well, that was the River Styx.

459
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,750
[YUZU] So, that's the
story of the lonely girl

460
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,583
and a slightly odd night I had
my first summer at Konohanatei.

461
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,625
[OKIKU]
The end.

462
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,958
[URINOSUKE]
Oink. Oink.
