But we weren't the

I, myself, happen to like them.

Turtles are so considerate.

If you will allow me,
I will explain.

enough to put me down?

I don't mean to impose, miss,

00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,666
but would you please
flip me back over?

12

[SATSUKI]
Why do I even bother?

13
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,666
What's the deal with
this sea turtle?

14
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,208
No idea. Ask Yuzu.
She brought him.

15
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,791
I was sunbathing
on the beach,

just minding my own
business, when suddenly...

Yeah! Nice catch!

I know! Just look at her eyes!

Thank you so much, young
foxes! You've saved my life.

I'm forever in your debt.

Could one of you please remove

this painful rope from
around my shell?

This crack here is from
where I was run over.

[BELL-RINGER A]
The bell's gone!

[TURTLE A] Despite the injury,
they did save my life.

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,500
And to show my gratitude,

41
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,666
I'd like to invite the two
of them to accompany me

42
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,125
on a visit to the holy
shrine of the sea god.

43
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,166
To Ryugu Castle?
That holy shrine?

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,333
You're so lucky, Yuzu!
I wish I could come, too!

45
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,583
Visiting the castle seems
to mean a lot to you.

Why don't you go in my place?

You mean it?

48
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

49
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,750
If it will make you happy,
you should be the one to go.

50

Well, uh, I'm not quite
sure how to say this,

51
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,166
but I'm afraid I don't
have enough strength

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,416
to carry anyone
heavier than Yuzu.

53
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,291
Not the shell! Please!
It's already cracked!

Who are you calling heavy?!

to say I'm light!

Sakura!

65
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,333
I don't understand.

66
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,666
Urashima and Yamasachihiko
had no trouble free diving.

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,333
Urashima must have had
some seriously big lungs.

68
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,666
Yamasachihiko was a
hunter, wasn't he?

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,000
He lost his brother's fishhook,

70
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,791
went to the bottom of the
sea to go look for it,

71
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,375
and then the sea god
helped him find it.

72
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,875
That is correct, Yuzu.

73
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,875
And it was I who took him to
the shrine to ask for help.

74
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,333
Huh? Are you sure?

75
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,583
'Cause in the book I read,

76
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,291
the god of tides made a
boat for Yamasachihiko.

77
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,125
[NATSUME]
Hm?

78
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,708
I'm surprised you know that.

79
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,458
Back when I lived
with Sister Bikuni,

80
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,333
I read the <i>Kojiki</i> several times.

81
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,166
Yamasachihiko was a triplet.

82
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,666
He and his brothers were born
during a trial by fire.

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,791
Their mother set the
midwife's house ablaze.

84
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,333
Konohanasakuyahime did this

85
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,875
to prove to her
skeptical husband

86
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,208
that these were indeed
his divine children.

87
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,666
You believe me now, Ninigi?

88
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,916
These are your kids!

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,625
The entire place burned
down and they're fine!

[NINIGI] I'm sorry for
ever doubting you.

91
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,708
But this isn't the sea.
It's a pond. It's enclosed.

92
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,458
How do you plan on getting to
the sea god's shrine from here?

93
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,500
Honestly, Natsume. How
dumb do you think he is?

94
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,875
On the other hand,
maybe he is that dumb.

95
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,916
This is ridiculous.
We need to get back to work.

96
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,750
Uh, would you at least
come down to the shore

97
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,250
and sit with me for a while?

98
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,750
I wish that I could, but I have
work I need to do as well.

[whistling]

100
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,208
And Sakura gets bored if
she's not doing her chores.

101

Work you say?

102
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,333
There is no work.

103
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,416
At the shrine, you wouldn't
have to do anything.

104
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,291
No labor or chores at all.

105
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,125
Really, nothing at all?

106
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,750
No responsibilities?

107
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,958
[TURTLE A] That's right. You
wouldn't have to lift a finger.

108
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,791
You could spend every
day having fun.

109
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,625
I could?

110
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,041
Thanks but no
thanks, Mr. Turtle.

111
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,875
I don't think I'd really know
what to do with myself.

112
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,541
Konohanatei has new guests

113

coming and going all
the time, constantly.

114

They have their own
secrets and stories,

115
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,083
and each one of them teaches
me something very important.

116
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,458
Despite the fact that I've now
waited on lots of them,

117
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,458
I still don't feel
like I'm done yet.

118
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,875
So, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,000
Your invitation's very
kind, but I can't.

120
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,833
I'm not ready to
leave Konohanatei.

121
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,583
I hope you'll forgive me.

Oh, nothing.

That's a terrible shame.

Though, I understand.

Still, I was looking forward to
finally having some company.

Why don't you go ahead
and invite him inside?

Great! Sounds good to me.

Not you, too, Natsume.

[ALL] Right this way, sir.
Welcome to Konohanatei.

Please enjoy your stay.

Aww!

Begging your pardon, sir,

but we ask that you wash off
any dirt before you enter.

I don't mind a bit.

I hope he's okay.

160
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,500
You can't go bringing back

161
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,750
everybody you find
on the street.

162
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,125
We ask people to make
reservations here.

163
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,583
Even visiting dignitaries
make arrangements in advance.

164
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,750
Sorry. I didn't know.

165
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,000
[AWANAMI]
You there, fox child.

166
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,625
Uh. Yes?

167
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,291
Can I help you, ma'am?

168
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,041
[AWANAMI] Go fetch the
boss or Kiri for me.

169
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,750
Do you have a reservation
with us, ma'am?

170
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,583
I don't, because
I don't need one.

171
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,875
[REN sighs]

172
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,458
Being around Yuzu really
gets to me sometimes.

173
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,791
She so naïve.

174
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,666
[YUZU]
Ren! Ren! Come quick! Hurry!

175
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,750
What?

176
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,791
There's a guest
without a reservation

177
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,708
and she says she
doesn't need one!

178
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,416
Look. Today we're already
busy enough as it is.

179
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,000
If this bozo doesn't have a
reservation, send them packing.

180
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,291
[chuckles]

181
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,041
Go and tell the boss that
Mistress Awanami is here.

182
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,500
She should understand.

183
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,833
I see. So your name's
Mistress Awanami?

184
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,666
Wait right here a
moment, I'll go-- Ah!

185
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,083
Please pardon my co-worker.
She meant no disrespect.

186
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,625
I'll go get my boss immediately!

187
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,875
It's all right.

188
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,833
I'm tired. Tell the boss
that I'm waiting inside.

189
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,458
[REN]
Yes, Mistress.

190
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,375
Uh, Ren? Why'd you
shove me like that?

191
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,791
Who was that lady?

192
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,791
Mistress Awanami is
a goddess, you moron!

193
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,750
Uh! I forgot!

194
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,958
The boss isn't here.
She's away on business.

195
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,791
I'll have to let Kiri
know right away!

196
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,083
[KIRI] What? Mistress Awanami's
here at the hotel?

197
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,458
Without any notice?

198
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,375
She's always showing
up out of nowhere.

199
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,625
What should we do?
We've got guests already.

200
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,791
Where will we put her?

201
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,541
The whole place is
completely booked up.

202
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,833
And Satsuki's in town
running errands.

203
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,041
Any ideas?

204
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,833
When it comes to VIPs,

205
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:58,291
the boss and I typically prefer
to handle them ourselves.

206
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,166
But--

207
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,666
Yes?

208
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,375
[KIRI] This time, I'd like you
to take care of her, Ren.

209
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,541
[REN] I get to wait on
an actual goddess?

210
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,500
[REN]
Of course!

211
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,083
No problem. I'd be happy to!

212
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,333
Though it might get a bit lonely
working all by yourself.

213
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,041
So, Yuzu, you help Ren out.

214
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:18,958
[YUZU]
Okay.

215
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,166
[KIRI]
I'm counting on you two.

216
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,791
We'll be able to handle
this, Ren. I know it!

217
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm sure that you've
got more than enough

218
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,083
of your own work to do.

219
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,291
I really don't need any help.

220
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,458
I can go it alone.

221
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,208
That's sweet of you to offer,

222
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,833
but Miss Kiri told me
to help you today,

223
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,333
so that's what I intend to do.

224
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,833
I'll be fine. Don't
worry about a thing!

225
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,041
[REN]
I'm worried about everything.

226
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,916
[AWANAMI] You're the little
foxes I met outside, right?

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,250
Kiri mentioned you'd
be waiting on me.

228
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,958
I'm Ren, Mistress.

229
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,583
Since the boss
is away right now,

230
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,750
I'll be helping you
today in Kiri's place.

231
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,416
And my name is Yuzu.

232
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,916
Would you allow me
to help you relax

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,833
by washing your back for you?

234
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,375
[AWANAMI]
Please do.

235
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,791
Oh? Do you not have
a loofah scrub?

236
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,333
You need a loofah scrub,
Mistress? I'll get it!

237
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,958
[YUZU yelps]

238
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,291
[YUZU]
Merlion!

239
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,125
I managed to find it.
Here you go.

240
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,458
[REN] Thank you, Yuzu,
but I've got this.

241
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,791
You can go do something else.

242
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,375
[YUZU]
But, Ren.

243
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,916
[REN] Leave, and don't give me
any more trouble, understand?

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
[YUZU]
I'm so sorry.

245
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:33,750
[NATSUME]
Hey!

246
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,541
[YUZU]
Hm?

247
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,208
What's a matter, Yuzu?

248
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,583
Did you mess up again
and get kicked out?

249
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,375
Eh?

250
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,875
[NATSUME]
Oh, I see. Don't be upset.

251
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,416
It's not you.

252
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,666
Ren's dream has always been
to wait on a high-ranking god.

253
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,125
She's just really eager.

254
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,583
[YUZU] So Mistress Awanami
isn't just any goddess,

255
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,125
she's important?

256
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
Yeah, there are
stories about her.

257
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,083
You know, mythical stuff like
in that "Koji," whatever it was.

258
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,875
[YUZU]
Uh! You mean the <i>Kojiki</i> ?

259
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,250
Yeah, that's it.

260
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:13,083
So she's the Goddess Awanami
from the Kamiumi myth?

261
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,708
[SATSUKI] She just showed up
out of the blue yet again?

262
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,916
Typical.

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,416
Since we're full,
and you weren't here,

264
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,875
I handed her off to Ren.

265
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,500
Fine. Ren should be able
to serve her well enough.

266
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,041
Okiku.

267
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,708
Mistress Awanami dropped
by today unannounced,

268
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,541
so be a good girl and
don't go wandering around.

269
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,541
"Be a good girl and
don't wander around."

270
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,333
What am I a baby?
Who is this Awanami person?

271
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,000
She isn't a person.

272
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,708
Mistress Awanami is the
goddess of water bubbles.

273
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,041
Her husband is the god Awanagi.

274
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,250
And she's the granddaughter
of the creator gods

275
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,250
Izanami and Izanagi, who
gave birth to this nation.

276
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,833
[REN] Mistress Awanami has
such lovely porcelain skin.

277
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,125
She really is just as
beautiful and delicate

278
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,875
as the bubbles
she presides over.

279
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,833
[REN]
Wait. How is there lather?

280
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,000
Did I use soap?

281
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,333
So heavenly.

282
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,166
That's the spot. Right there.

283
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,583
Go ahead and scrub harder.

284
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,125
Okay!

285
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,625
[REN] Uh. The bubbles are so
thick, I can't see anything.

286
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,958
How about I rinse you off now?

287
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,250
[REN screams]

288
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,833
Ren, what happened?

289
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,208
I don't know!

290
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:41,000
[BUBBLE BABIES sighing]

291
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,958
What the heck's going on?

292
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,625
Yuzu, quick! One's
headed right for you!

293
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,125
I got it!

294
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,166
[YUZU]
Oh, no! I popped a goddess!

295
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,791
I'm so sorry!

296
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,583
[NATSUME]
It's like they're multiplying!

297
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,500
Please, Mistress Awanami,
don't fly away.

298
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,125
[NATSUME] How do we
put her back together?

299
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,750
I'll go get Miss Kiri.
She'll know what to do.

300
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,083
[REN]
No!

301
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,708
Whatever you do,
please don't tell Kiri.

302
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,750
She trusted me to handle this.

303
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,750
So I have to figure
it out myself.

304
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,125
I don't know. What if
you can't fix it?

305
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,958
[NATSUME] Uh-oh!
Some of them went outside.

306
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,291
If the wind gets them,
they'll blow away!

307
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,333
Calm down. It'll be okay.

308
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,791
I'll catch the ones outside.
You grab the ones in here.

309
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,458
We'll be partners in crime.

310
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,291
[REN]
Nastume.

311
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,500
And I'm your partner, too.

312
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,916
We're all in this together.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,083
[REN]
Yuzu.

314
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,916
[NATSUME]
Now we're all partners in crime.

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,333
[REN] That means a lot.
Thanks you two.

316
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,375
It's getting fun!

317
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,166
Natsume! Wait!

318
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,125
[OKIKU] So she's the

Too complicated. I can't
wrap my head around it.

[BUBBLE BABY K gasps]

[NASUME chuckles]

00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,291
Yuzu! Incoming!

00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,500
Got it.

326
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,333
And I didn't pop you.

[OKIKU]
Help!

00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,875
[YUZU]
Urinosuke! Okiku!

332
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,791
Help! They're after me!

333
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,583
Go away! Go! Go!

Poor Okiku.

If there's not a lot
of air in there,

00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,000
maybe she's hallucinating.

Monsters! Evil crones!

Come any closer
and I'll haunt you

to the ends of the
earth and beyond!

340
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,208
Is it possible to haunt
a hallucination?

341
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,333
I don't have any idea.

Urinosuke? Okiku? You all right?

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,208
All right? Are you kidding me?
Of course I'm not!

00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,291
Stop! Come back,
Baby Awanami!

356

You won't be able to
outrun me for long!

357
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,583
I grew up in the mountains.
I've got tons of stamina!

[YUZU screams]

361
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,708
So heavy.

00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,541
Satsuki? Hey! What's
wrong? What happened?

363
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,708
I was wondering the
same thing myself.

364
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,083
[SATSUKI]
Yuzu, get off already!

365
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,166
Satsuki and I had some
spare time on our hands,

366
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,125
so we came to check on you.

367
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,583
And there you were, floating
in the middle of the hallway.

368
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,250
So, care to explain
what this is all about?

369
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,041
Well, uh...

370
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,166
Sorry. It's all my
fault. Blame me.

371

[REN]
No, it's not!

372
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,083
Yuzu was only
trying to help me.

373
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,375
This is my fault. Mine alone.

374
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,708
I should've told you
earlier. I'm sorry.

375
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,833
[KIRI] Uh! Careful!
You're spilling them!

376
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,333
I think I can guess
what happened.

377
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,416
It'll be all right.

378
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,666
Just go and catch the others

379
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,291
and we'll get
everything sorted out.

380
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,666
[YUZU, REN]
Okay.

381
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,083
[REN]
Hey, Yuzu.

382
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,416
Yeah?

383
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,375
I know I asked you to keep
quiet and not tell Kiri,

384
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,541
but that didn't mean I wanted
you to take the fall for me.

385
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,083
Partners in crime or not,

386
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,791
it wouldn't be right
if I let you do that.

387
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,875
Thanks.

388
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,458
I was wrong. I shouldn't
have done that.

389
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,041
You're a really amazing person,
Ren. I'm glad we're friends.

390
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,416
[REN] Stop saying stuff like
that. It's embarrassing.

391
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,833
[gasps] Hey!

392
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,916
[SATSUKI]
This is Mistress Awanami?

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,833
I thought Mistress Awanami was
a single guest, not a group.

394
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,166
Well, it's complicated,

395
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,166
but she was actually one
guest when she got here.

396
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,666
[OKIKU]
Uh?

397
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,958
If that's the case,
how'd she end up like this?

398
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,541
It's my fault.

399
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,291
I scrubbed her so hard with the
loofah, she turned into bubbles.

400
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,833
[SATSUKI] You can't have
scrubbed her that hard.

401
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,208
It's impossible.

402
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,208
I'm sure Kiri knows the real
reason this happened.

403
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,125
[YUZU] Speaking of
Miss Kiri, where is she?

404
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,666
[SATSUKI]
Oh.

405
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,708
She said there was one last
Baby Awanami and went to get it.

406
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,916
Sakura.

407
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,791
[KIRI]
Don't bother trying to hide it.

408
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,916
Sakura.

409
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,208
That's part of Mistress Awanami.

410
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,791
She's going through her
rebirth right now.

411
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,333
While all earthly creatures
only have from birth to death,

412
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,416
gods and goddesses are immortal.

413
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,708
They go on forever by
repeating the circle of life.

414
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,250
So what you've got
there is a piece

415
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,208
of Mistress Awanami's soul.

416
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,083
Like a child or a memory.

417
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,958
It's very important to her.
So let's give it back now.

418
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,333
[SAKURA]
Okay.

419
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,708
[KIRI]
Good.

420
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,250
What's wrong with you?

421
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,541
[SATSUKI]
I can't look at blobby things.

422
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,666
They make me sick to my stomach.

423
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,208
[sighs]

424
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,166
Sorry for all the
trouble I caused.

425
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,958
[KIRI]
I'm not sure that you are.

426
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,166
If you were going
to break apart,

427
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,541
you could've stayed home.

428
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,333
I know, but I was taking
a stroll through town

429
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,541
when I felt a sudden
urge, so I came here.

430
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,541
You make us sound like a toilet.

431
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,791
Ha-ha!

432
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,500
That got kinda scary.

433
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,208
You're a possessed doll.
Why would you be afraid?

434
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,375
When I was in that bubble,

435
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,750
I had all sorts of
weird hallucinations.

436
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,333
Hallucinations? Really?

437
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,458
Yeah, these mean old
women were chasing me

438
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,208
and I couldn't get away!

439
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,125
That's what they were?

440
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,791
[SATSUKI]
Something the matter, Yuzu?

441
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,750
[YUZU gasps]

442
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,291
Uh, no.

443
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,583
[YUZU]
Those weren't hallucinations.

444
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,083
They were memories etched
into Mistress Awanami's soul

445
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,500
of this country being born.

446
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,250
[YUZU, SATSUKI gasp]

447
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,125
[YUZU] "We mortals
are fragile creatures,

448
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,708
and our time on this
earth is fleeting."

449
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,833
That makes us a lot like
bubbles, doesn't it?

450
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,750
[SATSUKI]
Huh? What are you talking about?

451
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,916
[YUZU giggles]

452
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,541
[YUZU]
It's a secret.
