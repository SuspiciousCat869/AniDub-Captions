1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,625
[OKIKU]
Through a darkened corridor,

2
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,916
where none were supposed
to have tread.

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,666
A child walks,
sounds of something dripping

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,041
on the floor and
dragging behind her

5
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,791
echo as she goes.

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,875
[OKIKU]
Her skin, as pale as alabaster.

7
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,375
[OKIKU]
Her cold, glass eyes stare out,

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,541
full of evil!

9
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,541
[CHILDREN scream]

10
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,750
[OKIKU]
Or so I thought.

11
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,208
[OKIKU] So then...
How did this happen?

12
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,000
[KIRI] Holy One, why do
you have a doll with you?

13
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,583
[PRIEST A] I was told it
was evil and asked to exorcise

14
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,708
the spirit possessing it.

15
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,500
But I wouldn't call it evil.

16
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,958
All it does is speak
and move on its own.

17
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,416
Its hair grows, too, but
that doesn't make it bad.

18
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,125
Hey, doll. Can you
make tables levitate

19
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,458
or plates fly through the air?

20
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,125
No doll with a shred of decency

21
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,541
would lower herself to
that kind of haunting!

22
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,000
So ya don't do ghost stuff?

23
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,291
Well that's no fun at all.

24
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,541
She's a doll, Natsume!
Don't be rude!

25
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,750
It's okay if you're
not a real poltergeist.

26
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,500
You're a great possessed
doll, just as you are.

27
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,625
[OKIKU]
Hang on...

28
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,541
Was that meant to try
and cheer me up?

29
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,875
Your attempts at kindness
don't always hit the mark.

30
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,208
Huh? What did I say?

31
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,958
Did I mess something up?
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,166
[NATSUME] Do you have a battle
mode where your arms and legs

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,041
come off and you morph
into a fighting doll?

34
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,166
[OKIKU]
Are you crazy?!

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,083
What's the matter
with these people?

36
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,875
Normally all I have
to do to make folks

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,333
scream and cry is walk
down a dark hallway.

38
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,958
This is humiliating!

39
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,041
Look at that hair.

40
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,666
It's gotten pretty
long there, Okiku.

41
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,500
Your name's Okiku?
That's so nice!

42
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,375
[OKIKU] Don't just make
up a name for me!

43
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,875
Sakura, you've got
scissors, don't ya?

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,166
Come here and give her a trim.

45
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,250
[OKIKU]
Wait a minute!

46
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,375
Children shouldn't play
with sharp objects!

47
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,416
Hold on, be gentle...

48
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,291
Don't worry. It's fine.

49
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,708
[OKIKU]
But her eyes...!

50
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,500
They have an evil gleam!

51
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,083
This may be the first
time I've ever seen

52
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,250
Sakura smile.

53
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,750
Careful not to move
or you'll get hurt.

54
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,000
[OKIKU whimpering]

55
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,125
Please, no!

56
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,708
Or at least, can't
someone else do it?!

57
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,041
[NATSUME] Didn't your little
niece do something like this

58
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,583
to her doll?

59
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,666
[SATSUKI] Uh, yeah.
It was quite imaginative.

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,833
Very avant-garde.

61
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,333
[NATSUME]
Well, you know what they say.

62
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,416
It'll grow back.

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,750
Don't say it like
I'm some dumb kid

64
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,583
who cut her bangs too
short before picture day!

65
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,458
[crying]

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,500
[REN] It's noisy in there.
What's going on?

67
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,125
[OKIKU]
I'm supposed to be an heirloom,

68
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,708
a one-of-a-kind doll
of the highest quality!

69
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,875
I was made by a
master craftsman!

70
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,208
What kind of a doll
am I if I'm hideous?

71
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,250
[REN growls]

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,458
[OKIKU gasps]

73
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,000
You are only ugly
if you think you are!

74
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,875
Listen to me,
if just being born a girl

75
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,250
automatically made you pretty,
life would be easy!

76
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,333
But becoming a beautiful
woman takes refinement

77
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,708
and hard work!

78
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,541
Sakura, hand over the scissors.

79
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,666
[SATSUKI]
She's doing her makeup, too!

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,500
[YUZU]
Wow! Such incredible skill!

81
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,791
[OKIKU]
Is this really me?

82
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,375
Hey! I'm supposed to
be a traditional doll!

83
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,958
Now she just needs a kimono.

84
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,000
What color?

85
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,125
Hey!

86
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,333
Hmm...
What she's got on is nice,

87
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,708
but this might look better.

88
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,583
[cutting noise]

89
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,375
You don't have
to do that for me.

[REN]
Natsume.

00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,291
Could you please bring
me my sewing kit?

'Kay.

93

Feel free to use some
of my old clothes.

[REN]
Thanks, Kiri. I will.

95
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,666
You can also take scraps
from mine if you want.

96
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,541
Oh? Yours, too?

97
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,875
Hey! Don't forget about mine!

98
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,833
You don't even have
your own kimono.

99
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,291
Don't worry.
There's already enough.

100
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,083
[YUZU] Then can I maybe
help with the sewing?

101
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,333
[REN]
Do you know how to sew?

102
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,583
[YUZU]
Yes!

103
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,208
Sister Bikuni taught me
when I lived with her.

104
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,041
[REN]
Great.

105
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,541
Then here. Do these frills.

106
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,500
[YUZU]
Frills? Uh, okay.

107
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,541
[REN] Yuzu, you're
doing them all wrong.

108
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,791
Let me.

109
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,125
Sorry, Ren. I haven't
ever sewn frills before.

110
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,500
Well, you should have said so.

111
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,291
Still, your stitching
does seem to be

112
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,666
clean and straight.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,458
Your eyes are so
life-like and beautiful.

114
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,750
The glass sparkles in the light.

115
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,916
And your porcelain skin
is so white and smooth.

116
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,375
[YUZU] Someone obviously
made you with a lot of care

117
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,083
for a girl who must
have been very special.

118
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,750
[MOM] Traditional Japanese
dolls are so creepy.

119
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,125
But dear...

120
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
My mother gave it to us
for her first granddaughter.

121
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,833
We have to keep it.

122
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,333
[MOM sighs] It's far too
detailed and intricate.

123
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,166
Especially in the eyes.

124
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,416
It's almost like
it's staring at us.

125
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,833
Put it away in the
closet or something.

126
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,291

Sorry, little doll.

Buy me a new dress-up doll!

[CHILD B]
Me, too! Me, too!

132
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,333
[MOM]
All right, girls.

133
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,083
If that's what you want.

134
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,416
[CHILD A] Thanks, Mom!
[CHILD B] Yay!

Hey, girls.

00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,666
I'm a doll.

She must have been very tired.

Apparently dolls sleep, too.

Quiet, Urinosuke.

You were quite helpful indeed.

How come I have to
dress like a maid?

You are just full of complaints.

[PRIEST A] I think your

more than enough.

she's so focused on her work.

00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,125
Thank you for giving
me the opportunity.

318
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,541
[YUZU] Spinning threads out
of raindrops for weaving

319
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,250
must be difficult and
take a lot of practice.

320
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,208
Is it something you think
I might be able to learn?

321
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,833
I'm afraid not.

322
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,291
My sisters and I are servants
of the gods of heaven,

323
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,333
which means that we
alone can spin the threads

324
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
and make the cloth.

325
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,708
Wait a second. So all the
rain cloth you've been weaving

326
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,083
is a gift for the gods?

327
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,666
Is that why you've
been in such a hurry

328
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,000
to finish it?

329
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,958
Don't worry. It's beautiful.

330
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,333
They'll love it
when they see it,

331
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,708
and appreciate all the
hard work that went into it.

332
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,041
[IORI]
You're right.

333
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,250
They do know how
hard I've worked.

334
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,666
They'll like it.

335
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,458
However, this still
isn't finished yet,

336
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,125
but when it is I'll let
you be the first one

337
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,458
to see it.

338
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,791
Don't tell anyone, though.

339
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,000
It's our secret.

340
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,041
Sure.

341
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,666
[YUZU] Please don't overwork
yourself, Miss Iori.

342
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,833
Make sure you eat
when you get hungry,

343
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,625
and rest when
you feel tired.

344
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:48,916
Yummy.

345
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,583
[IORI] "Make sure you eat
when you get hungry.

346
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,541
And rest when you feel tired."

347
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,791
Don't overdo it.

348
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,916
Simple enough.

349
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,791
[IORI]
Okay. I'll try it.

350
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,083
[YUZU panting]

351
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,958
It's done? It's really done?

352
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,125
[YUZU]
Yay! Congratulations!

353
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,083
Here. Hold this end.

354
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,958
Be sure you grip it tight.

355
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,291
Ready?

356
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,375
And up!

357
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,000
[REN]
Hey, look!

358
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,208
[NATSUME]
The sky's clearing up.

359
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,083
[KIRI]
Finally.

360
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,458
Summer is here.
