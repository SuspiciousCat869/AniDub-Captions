Okay.

There's stuff inside.
Old papers.

It's not a file.

Hardly. What is this thing?

Sorry, I was helping
the boss clean the attic

41

As in the servants of the gods
who work in their shrines?

The boss just said to throw out
all the files in an old box,

but when I saw it,
I got curious.

From the looks of it,

Why would she even have
something like this?

Good question.

Let's take it to the shrine
with us and find out.

52
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,958
It might turn out to be a
clue to her secret past.

53

She has a secret
past? What kind?

you don't ask for

That's the foundation
of the human world.

159
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,375
Our job is merely to
help them do that.

160
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,666
[YUZU]
That's-That's so beautiful!

161
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,375
You're saving the world
and you're so humble about it!

162
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,541
What is this girl?
She's not one of us.

163
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,458
[TSUBAKI] Well, she had a
scroll, so I thought she was.

164
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,125
That's why I brought her here.

165
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,166
That's right! The scroll!

166
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,291
I brought it to the shrine

167
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,208
hoping someone could
tell me about it.

168
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,250
This scroll looks just like
ours, but it's got a seal on it.

169
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,750
Only the person who
sealed it can open it.

170
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,833
And I don't know
whose seal that is.

171
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,500
[YUZU]
I see.

172
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,958
[YANAGI] Okay, I think
I've got the gist of it.

173
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,375
You found the scroll in a box

174
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,375
at this place
called Konohanatei,

175
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,875
and that's where you work.

176
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,708
[YUZU]
Mh-hm.

177
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,916
[TSUBAKI, YANAGI]
Hmm...

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,291
[YANAGI]
What do you think, Tsubaki?

179
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,708
[TSUBAKI] It doesn't sound
to me like she's lying.

180
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,916
And the scroll is real.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,333
Which all means...

182
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,333
I messed up big when
I brought her here.

183
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,666
So then, what's your name?

184
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,750
You can call me Yuzu.

185
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,416
Well, Yuzu, afraid
I've got some bad news.

186
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,625
[YUZU]
Hm?

187
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,041
[TSUBAKI]
This Konohanatei you mentioned

188
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,125
doesn't exist in this world.

189
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,208
[YUZU]
Huh?

190
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,000
[TSUBAKI]
I'm saying... it's not there.

191
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,208
You can't ever go home.

192
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,666
[YUZU]
Hm?

193
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,083
[SATSUKI]
Yuzu!

194
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,375
Hey, have you seen Yuzu?

195
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,625
No, but it is crowded.

196
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,166
Don't worry, though.

197
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,208
I told her just to go back to
Konohanatei if she got lost.

198
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,041
She's not a baby.
She'll be fine.

199
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,208
[SATSUKI] I know it's not
like she's helpless.

200
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,500
But something
doesn't feel right.

201
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,791
[YUZU] What... What do you
mean I can't ever go home?

202
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,083
[TSUKUSHI]
Uh! Kozue!

203
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,791
Are you all right?

204
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,750
Sorry for collapsing on you.

205
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,125
We're so busy right now,
this is the last thing you need.

206
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,416
We'll be okay.

207
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
You've been working
non-stop for far too long.

208
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,583
[KOZUE] But if I can't keep
going, how will you manage?

209
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,875
There won't be enough
record keepers.

210
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,625
[YUZU]
Uh. Excuse me.

211
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,250
If you're a bit shorthanded,
perhaps I could help out.

212
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,166
I know how to read and write.
I can fill in for her.

213
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,375
[TSUKUSHI]
Sit here.

214
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,916
[YANAGI]
This is your ink and brush.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,833
Write the people's names and
what they ask for on the scroll.

216
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,666
[TSUBAKI] Be quick! They're
gonna come one after another.

217
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,791
Uh, okay.

218
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,708
[WISHER A] Get rid of him.
Then I can get promoted.

219
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,916
[YUZU] I hear people's
voices in my head,

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,875
what they're wishing
and praying for.

221
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,791
They're so angry and selfish.

222
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,958
[clapping]

223
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,416
[BOY A] Thank you for
helping my mommy.

224
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,125
She's all better now!

225
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,208
[WISHER C] My daughter-in-law
safely delivered a healthy boy.

226
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,083
[WISHER CC] Thank the gods,
I found a new job

227
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,000
and we didn't lose the house.

228
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,125
[WISHER D] Thank you for
getting me through finals.

229
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,000
[WISHER E] Thanks for helping
my dad quit smoking.

230
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,625
[TSUKUSHI]
We're done!

231
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,125
At last, we can finally
get some sleep.

232
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,208
Rest while you can.

233
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,791
Tomorrow it starts
all over again.

234
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,750
[KOZUE]
I'm so sorry.

235
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,083
You got dragged into
this becauseof me.

236
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,625
It's fine. Don't worry.

237
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,583
How are you now? Any better?

238
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,458
Yes. Better than before.

239
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,541
You <i>kenzoku</i> have
such a tough job.

240
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,916
I could barely keep up.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,583
It's difficult. That's for sure.

242
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,708
But for most people
who come to the shrines,

243
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,166
they've run out of options.

244
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,541
We're their last hope.

245
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,416
So what else can we do?

246
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,166
[YANAGI]
Your brushwork is good.

247
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,625
Where'd you learn to read and
write? Did you go to school?

248
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,041
[YUZU]
No. I was tutored.

249
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,166
Sister Bikuni taught me.

250
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,375
[INARI]
Sister Bikuni you say?

251
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,541
I know her well.
She is very devout.

252
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,708
My lady goddess.

253
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,875
Goddess? As in the
one you serve?

254
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,583
Inari Okami. Goddess
of rice and agriculture.

255
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,291
And who is this little fox?

256
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,250
Are you Sister
Bikuni's <i>kenzoku</i> ?

257
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,708
[YUZU]
Oh, no, lady goddess.

258
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not a <i>kenzoku</i> .
I work at a hotel.

259
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,666
A hotel?

260
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,083
So she was lost,

261
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,541
and somehow wandered onto
the "path of the gods."

262
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,416
That's when you, Tsubaki,
bumped into her,

263
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,458
and thinking she was a
<i>kenzoku</i> , brought her here?

264
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,291
[TSUBAKI]
Correct.

265
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,708
One thing.

266
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,458
What is this "path of the
gods" she's talking about?

267
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,916
I've never heard of it.

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,458
There are dozens of holy
shrines all over the country.

269
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,041
The "path of the gods" is a
passageway between them.

270
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,916
It's a quick way for the
gods and their servants

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,625
to get around.

272
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:26,958
Unfortunately for you, the path
also connects different times.

273
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,666
In other words, at this moment,

274
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,250
at this point in history,
Konohanatei doesn't exist.

275
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,791
Or at least, I've never
heard of a hot-spring hotel

276
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,583
for the gods.

277
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,625
[INARI]
Hot spring?

278
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,125
[TSUBAKI grunts]

279
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,583
Great idea.
Let's go and dig one.

280
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,541
We can't just go dig one!
It's complicated!

281
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,958
[INARI] There are too many
Inari shrines these days.

282
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,000
Managing them all is exhausting.

283
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,583
I just wanna sit in a hot spring
and relax for a little while.

284
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,708
Is that so difficult?

285
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,208
Please don't give me a guilt
trip, my lady goddess.

286
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,500
Sorry to interrupt.

287
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,625
But if this is a different
time, what do I do?

288
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,375
What are you talking about?
Fate brought you to us.

289
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,833
So there must
have been a reason.

290
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,375
Therefore, you should stay here.

291
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,458
[TSUBAKI] I knew she
was gonnna say that.

292
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,916
Yes, my lady.
She'll remain here.

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
But if she must stay,

294
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,583
could we at least keep her
as one of your <i>kenzoku</i> ?

295
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,958
She's well-educated,
and she learns quick.

296
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,000
We could definitely use her.

297
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,083
[TSUKUSHI]
Absolutely!

298
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,875

Yuzu on the team!

I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,125
Sorry for calling it
a grubby old hotel.

313
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,041
If you miss it so much, your
job there must be important.

314
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,833
[YUZU] No. I started
less than a year ago.

315
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,125
I don't handle the
important stuff.

316
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,208

00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,708
[YANAGI growls]

318
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,583
If you're just a new girl,
why would they care or notice?

319
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,958
Why're you so
desperate to get back?

320
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,791
[YUZU] You're right!
They don't need me at all!

321
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,791
[YANAGI]
Please don't cry.

322
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,750
I shouldn't have
said that. Sorry.

323
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,833
But... even so...

324
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,416
Konohanatei is more than
just the place I work,

325
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,750
it's my home!

326
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,750
And the people I work with,

327
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,875
they're not just friends,
they're like family!

328
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,583
[TSUBAKI] You're close
to them. I understand.

329
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,833
But say you were
able to go back,

330
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,750
it's still just a job.

331
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,791
Your friends won't
be there forever.

332
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,791
Eventually, you'll all
want to go your own ways.

333
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,041
[SATSUKI]
Once my job is done,

334
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,250
I'll try to join a shrine again.

335
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,500
[TSUBAKI] In the end,
you're not going to be together.

336
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,500
So why are you so determined
to get back to them?

337
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,291
[YUZU]
I guess...

338
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,041
Because I know them now.

339
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,625
And I can't go back to
the person I was before

340
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,416
because now they're part of me.

341
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,000
Such a rude old man.

342
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,333
He'd never talk to me like that
if I served the Inari shrine.

343
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,083
[YUZU]
They've changed me.

344
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,375
Everyone I've met at
Konohanatei has changed me.

345
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,583
They've made my life richer.

346
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,791
I can't help but love them.

347
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,333
Plus, if I suddenly vanished,
I think they'd be worried.

348
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,666
You are so dumb.

349
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,083
Did it not occur to you that
if you wanted to go home

350
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,000
for the sake of your
friends and not yourself,

351
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,500
you could just
write it on a scroll?

352
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,083
No. That never occurred
to me at all!

353
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,083
And it goes to show
how useless I am.

354
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,291
Maybe I shouldn't go back.

355
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,583
They might be better
off without me.

356
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,041
[YANAGI]
Although, sending you home

357
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,041
through space and time is
a bit beyond our abilities.

358
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,750
But don't despair just yet.
We'll figure something out.

359
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,916
As young <i>kenzoku</i> ,

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,375
we're not powerful
enough to take her back,

361
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,208
but I'm pretty sure
I know someone who is.

362
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,666
Sure. You take her
wherever she wants to go.

363
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,833
[TSUBAKI]
Which means you're distracted

364
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,500
and not going to help.

365
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,041
So, you guys know any older,
more powerful <i>kenzoku</i> ?

366
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,041
Thank you for trying so hard.

367
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,250
Tsubaki understands.

368
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,875
She's had trouble
finding her home, too.

369
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,666
She's actually new here.

370
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,708
A lifelong <i>kenzoku</i> ; she's
bounced from shrine to shrine

371
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,041
since she was a child.

372
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,625
The last one was
destroyed in a landslide.

373
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,333
So, she never really had
a home to begin with,

374
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,083
much less one to go back to.

375

There goes me and
my big mouth again.

376
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,083
She's gonna yell at me.

We don't know anyone?

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,291
Time travel is real tricky.

379

The <i>kenzoku</i> would have to
be hundreds of years old.

gonna find a fox like that?

00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,083
may she always be able
to find her way back home

468
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,208
to those who love and miss her.

469
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,666
Tsubaki.

470
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,416
[TSUBAKI] I've got a hunch
this might come in handy.

471
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:39,166
[YUBABA] It was such a long time
ago, I'd completely forgotten.

472
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,625
The little fox girl
I met that night.

473
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,750
I don't remember her
name or her face,

474
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,291
but I think she was
wearing a red hood.

475
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,875
Just one more thing.

476
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,500
Thanks for bringing
me back home.

477
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,291
Sure. Welcome home.

478
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,416
[YUZU] I wish for a
warm home for Tsubaki.

479
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,375
[NATSUME]
It's so cold!

480
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,250
[KIRI] Our New Year's Day guests
will be here any minute!

481
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,083
[REN]
Natsume, hurry up!

482
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,500
[NATSUME]
Coming!

483
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,333
Yuzu, could you meet them
at the top of the stairs?

484
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,166
Sure. I'll go right now.

485
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,333
[SATSUKI]
Thanks.

486
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,083
Welcome to Konohanatei.
Thanks for coming.

487
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,541
I hope you enjoy your stay.
