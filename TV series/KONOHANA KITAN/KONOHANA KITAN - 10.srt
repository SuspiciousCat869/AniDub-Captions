1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,208
[SATSUKI yawns]

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,541
[SATSUKI]
I'm tired.

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,125
Did you get enough sleep
last night, Satsuki?

4
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,458
[SATSUKI]
Nope.

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,958
I was working that wedding
banquet and it ran late.

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,208
The cook left a fresh pot
of tea and some snacks

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,541
in the break room.

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,541
You should go have some.
It might help pick you up.

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,875
Ya know, I think I will.

10
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,833
[SATSUKI sighs]

11
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,458
[SATSUKI] Nothing in the
jar. Is this a snack?

12
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,708
Maybe it's European
or something.

13
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,041
Oh, what a night!

14
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,625
Lucky your traveling
pharmacist friend

15
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,333
had some medicine
to make me bigger.

16
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,791
He really saved my tail!

17
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,291
Happy to help.

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,833
I might've known the groom's
family for quite some time,

19
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,541
but even so, at a cat wedding,

20
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,250
I could've ended up on the menu.

21
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,875
Now that the
celebration's over,

22
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,333
I'll just take the
shrinking medicine

23
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,875
and get back to normal.

24
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,125
[YUZU] Of course, sir.
It's right here.

25
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,041
[ALL gasp]

26
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,375
[NATSUME] So you ate the
pharmacist's shrinking medicine

27
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,000
thinking it was a snack?

28
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,250
What an idiot!

29
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,708
[YUZU]
I'm sorry, Satsuki.

30
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,208
I should've warned you there
was medicine in here, too.

31
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
The pharmacist didn't
bring extra big medicine,

32
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,708
so you'll be stuck
this way for a while.

33
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,583
You wanna wear this leaf
until he gets back?

34
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,916
[SATSUKI]
Hell no!

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,791
How 'bout this, Satuski?
I just finished sewing it.

36
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,666
[BOTH]
Aww! So cute!

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,458
[SATSUKI] Couldn't you have
made me a normal kimono?

38
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,875
[SATSUKI] Why is Okiku suddenly
staring daggers at me?

39
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,500
[OKIKU] Konohanatei only
needs one doll. One!

40
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,375
What are we going to do now?

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,541
You're my hardest worker.

42
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,041
Nothing gets done around
here without you.

43
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,541
[SATSUKI] It'll be fine.
I can still give orders.

44
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,916
C'mon, Yuzu. Let's go.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,083
[YUZU]
Okay.

46
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,791
[SATSUKI]
First, sweep all the hallways.

47
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,041
[YUZU]
Right.

48
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,166
[SATSUKI] Next, clean
the private bungalows.

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,958
[YUZU]
Got it.

50
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,208
[SATSUKI grunts]

51
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,000
[SATSUKI] Hey, Natsume!
Move your big fat feet!

52
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,916
You'll damage the moss!

53
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,791
Damn it. My voice seems
to have shrunk, too.

54
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,833
Yuzu. Go yell at her for me.

55
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,375
Yell? Okay.

56
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,583
Uh, Natsume! Please
don't walk on the moss!

57
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,791
The moss? Who cares about it?

58
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,625
Is Satsuki just
nitpicking again?

59
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,916
[SATSUKI]
I oughta smack you!

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,958
[YUZU] I should
reprimand you physically!

61
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,208
That's pretty much the same.

62
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,291
[SATSUKI]
Damn Natsume.

63
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,375
She really pisses
me off sometimes.

64
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,250
[YUZU giggles]

65
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,500
[SATSUKI] Yuzu, looks like
our guest finally got here.

66
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,166
[BOTH]
Good afternoon, ma'am.

67
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,375
[GUEST A]
Huh. Your voice has an echo.

68
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,666
[YUZU, SATSUKI]
Welcome to Konohanatei.

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,375
Sorry I'm late. I got
lost on my way here.

70
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,125
[SATSUKI]
Come. We'll get you settled.

71
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,375
[gasps]

72
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,250
But before that, may we
get you some warm water

73
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,083
to soak your feet in?

74
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,083
[GUEST A sighs]

75
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,958
[GUEST A]
That feels wonderful.

76
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,625
My feet were so sore
after such a long trip.

77
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,125
[YUZU]
How was the mountain path?

78
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,333
Have the leaves turned yet?

79
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,583
[SATSUKI]
The mountain path?

80
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,375
They have.

81
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:38,458
The colors were spectacular!
I was absolutely entranced!

82
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,875
That said...

83
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,666
The scenery in this garden
is quite lovely, too.

84
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,833
[SATSUKI] Yuzu, did you bring
that guest to the garden

85
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,250
because you knew the
leaves had changed

86
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,916
and it was pretty back there?

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,166
Uh-huh.

88
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,666
I thought soaking her
feet out in the garden

89
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,458
would be nice and relaxing.

90
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,500
She seemed so tired
from her mountain hike.

91
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,875
But how?

92
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,833
How'd you know she came
here through the mountains?

93
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,333
[YUZU]
Well...

94
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,583
She was carrying
a walking stick,

95
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,250
and her feet were dirty
with lots of blisters.

96
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,000
It reminded me of me.

97
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,708
When I first came
to Konohanatei,

98
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,916
I took the mountain
path to get here.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,083
So I could kind of tell.

100
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,166
[YUZU]
Satsuki?

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,375
What's next on your chore list?

102
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,375
Nothing. I don't have anything
else. We finished it all.

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,916
[SATSUKI]
I gotta hand it to her.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,166
She's really come a long way.

105
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,416
[YUZU screams]

106
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,458
[SATSUKI grunts]

107
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,458
[SATSUKI] Though she's still
just as klutzy as ever.

108
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,625
[sighs]

109
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,958
[NATSUME]
Ya know,

110
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,375
Satsuki being small might
not be such a bad thing.

111
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,083
She isn't nearly
as annoying now.

112
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,125
[SATSUKI]
What're you getting at?

113
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,750
Maybe you should
just stay this way.

114
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,500
She can't stay small!

115
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,708
She has to go back
to her normal self!

116
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,541
Sorry. I was only kidding.
Don't be upset.

117
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,791
[SATSUKI]
Yuzu.

118
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,250
Why does Natsume have to get
such a kick outta my misery?

119
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,208
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,750
It's all my fault that this
happened in the first place.

121
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,708
No, I should've
been more careful.

122
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,791
It's not your fault Yuzu.

123
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,541
[YUZU] Even though you're
cute when your small,

124
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,208
you're different now.

125
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,500
And you're unhappy.

126
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,291
I want the real Satsuki back!

127
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,291
I'd do anything to make
you the right size again.

128
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,250
Anything at all,
so long as it'll fix you.

129
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,500
[SATSUKI]
Yuzu.

130
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,208
Without you to
help me, I'm lost.

131
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,291
I look up to you. I need you!

132
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,875
[SATSUKI]
She's wrong.

133
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,833
She wouldn't be as lost
and helpless as she thinks.

134
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,625
Today I got to see
that for myself.

135
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,750
Hi, Satsuki!

136
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,375
[SATSUKI]
And from where I was sitting,

137
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,708
it was the best view of all.

138
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,250
[YUZU gasps]

139
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,833
Satsuki, you're big again!

140
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,916
[YUZU]
Thank goodness!

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,291
I was so worried about
you! It's a miracle!

142
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,333
[NATSUME]
Aww.

143
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,166
That was certainly
anticlimactic.

144
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,916
The pharmacist came in
the middle of the night

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,875
to deliver the medicine to her.

146
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,166
[FURRY GUEST]
I imagine it's been difficult.

147
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,916
[KIRI] Might as well
give it to her now.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,541
So the pharmacist had to make
an extra trip back here,

149
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,791
and I didn't get a wink
of sleep last night.

150
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:25,625
But she's cured.

151
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,041
I'm so happy for you.

152
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,041
But I don't understand.
How did I get back to normal?

153
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,416
Heh.

154
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Your return to your true
size is quite the mystery.

155
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,958
I've heard some Western
stories claim the best way

156
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,291
to undo magical spells
and transformations

157
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,833
is a kiss from one's true love.

158
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,541
Maybe a secret admirer gave
you a little mouth-to-mouth

159
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,541
while you were asleep.

160
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,083
Just kidding.

161
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,083
[YUZU] I'd do anything to make
you the right size again.

162
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,208
Anything at all,
so long as it'll fix you.

163
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,875
Wait! What's wrong?!
Come back! Where are you going?

164
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,375
Satsuki!

165
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,791
[SATSUKI] That can't be how
it happened. There's no way.

166
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,166
It can't be. Can it?

167
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,875
[YUZU]
Satsuki, where'd you go?

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,916
[AYAME] We haven't seen your
sister since the banquet

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,291
after the sacred
cherry tree bloomed.

170
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,083
[HIIRAGI] Not like she bothered
to stick around and chat.

171
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,416
All right then.

172
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,958
We're here!

173
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,333
When you shout like that,

174
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,333
you sound like you're
challenging them to a fight.

175
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,875
Really? Hiiragi is coming to
visit us at Konohanatei?

176
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,208
Yes, she is.

177
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,291
So what? Why are you so excited?

178
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,000
How can I not be excited?

179
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,708
Hiiragi and our very own
Satsuki are sisters!

180
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,958
Satsuki dreamed her whole life
about becoming a priestess,

181
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,750
but their parents
decided that Hiiragi

182
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,041
should become a priestess,

183
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,208
and Satsuki should come
work here at the hotel.

184
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,416
Sibling drama, and
it's so juicy, too!

185
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,125
I can't wait to see
the sparks fly!

186
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,750
Yuzu, did Satsuki
tell you about it?

187
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,041
Not really.

188
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,000
[NATSUME]
Shh!

189
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,041
Here come the priestesses now.

190
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,416
Hey! You there!

191
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,666
Yes. Hello?

192
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,666
You're pretty cute. You should
stop by my room tonight.

193
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,166
Please excuse my companion.

194
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,333
She likes to flirt with
anything that moves.

195
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,083
You didn't have to
whack me, Ayame!

196
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,833
She didn't mean it.
No harm done.

197
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,250
They're unusual, aren't they?

198
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,666
Who's been assigned to take care
of them while they're here?

199
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,333
Well, if I had to
guess, knowing Kiri...

200
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,875
I'd like you to be responsible
for the priestesses, Satsuki.

201
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,375
You're not gonna tell me you
can't 'cause it's your sister?

202
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,000
That would be extremely
unprofessional.

203
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,250
Damn her. This is evil.

204
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,916
Please, don't worry. I'll
be right here to help you.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,541
So you won't need
to push yourself.

206
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,166
What do you mean by
"pushing myself"?

207
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,250
In what way?

208
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,416
Uh. Nothing.

209
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
[SATSUKI] She was going
to work at Konohanatei,

210
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,208
but she's older than me,
so I went in her place.

211
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,791
They chose her to be
a priestess over me.

212
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:07,500
[REN] Sibling drama. I can't
wait to see the sparks fly!

213
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,166
[HIIRAGI]
Satsuki.

214
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,208
I brought a batch of mother's
famous rice bran pickles.

215
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,458
Nukazuke!

216
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,000
You've always likes salty,
old people's food,

217
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,583
ever since you were small.

218
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,166
You'd also drink too much water
after eating and wet the bed.

219
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,750
Hiiragi!

220
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,416
I mean, thank you for coming
and we hope you enjoy your stay.

221
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I am Satsuki and this is Yuzu.

222
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,458
We'll be the ones taking care
of you during your visit.

223
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,875
It's nice to see you again.

224
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,416
You danced beautifully the day
the sacred tree bloomed.

225
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,791
[HIIRAGI]
This shrimp was there that day?

226
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,916
Yes, Hiiragi. She sat
right next to your sister.

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,500
The staff here at Konohanatei

228
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,291
are supposed to
be shining stars.

229
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,291
What's a plain little pipsqueak
like you doing here?

230
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,666
Uh. Well, I--

231
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,583
Pardon me, but with
all due respect,

232
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,416
one should never judge
a book by its cover.

233
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,208
Yuzu may be young and not
have as much experience,

234
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,666
but she's quite capable.

235
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,291
As capable as any other
staff member here.

236
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,750
Thank you, Satsuki.

237
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,583
[HIIRAGI]
Hmph.

238
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,000
Bath time. Come on, Ayame.

239
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,833
[AYAME]
Sure. Right behind you.

240
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,000
[YUZU] Hey, I really appreciate
you sticking up for me--

241
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,000
[SATSUKI] You better not
make a liar outta me, Yuzu.

242
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,666
Everything has to go smoothly.

243
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,916
Don't you dare screw
this up, understand?

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,291
[YUZU]
Okay.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,458
[HIIRAGI chuckles]

246
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,458
Yay! Cannonball!

247
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,833
Please don't jump in.
It's not safe.

248
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,833
Huh?

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,625
[HIIRAGI laughing]

250
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,458
What are you?
A five-year-old?

251
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,208
[HIIRAGI] Since you're all wet,
and already here,

252
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,583
you might as well join me.

253
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,708
[SATSUKI] Employees can't
take baths with guests.

254
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,291
Come on, when we were little,

255
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,708
you would cry and beg to take
baths with me all the time.

256
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,583
Stop bringing up our childhood!

257
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,791
[HIIRAGI]
"Please, sissy? Pretty please!"

258
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,666
Could you help me?

259
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,041
Uh. Sure.

260
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,833
If you would wash my
back, that'd be lovely.

261
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,000
[HIIRAGI chuckles]

262
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,916
Oh, come on. I was only teasing.

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,166
You're never any fun.

264
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,833
Has Satsuki told you
that originally Hiiragi

265
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,125
was supposed to be the
one who worked here?

266
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,125
And she came in her place?

267
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,875
Uh, yes. She did.

268
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,500
So then you know.

269
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,041
It may look like they
don't get along,

270
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,208
but Hiiragi can't wait for
her sister to be a priestess.

271
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,291
Hiiragi is the shrine
master's favorite.

272
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,250
All she'd have to do is ask.

273
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,291
If the shrine were
to summon Satsuki.

274
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,250
Konohanatei would have
no say in the matter.

275
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,625
[AYAME] I can tell Satsuki
is precious to you.

276
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,083
Please don't hate us
if we take her away.

277
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,541
After all, becoming a
priestess is her dream.

278
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,958
[SATSUKI] Once my job is done,
I'll try to join a shrine again.

279
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,875
[YUZU] Satsuki's always
wanted to be a priestess.

280
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,500
And she's worked hard.

281
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,625
She deserves to have her
dream finally come true.

282
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,791
I should be happy for her,
but I don't want her to go.

283
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,375
[SATSUKI]
Hiiragi!

284
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
Hiiragi, where are you?

285
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,791
Did something happen?

286
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,458
[SATSUKI] My sister's
been missing all day.

287
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,833
She's always been
a troublemaker,

288
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,250
but this is a new low.

289
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,125
I can't believe she'd--

290
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:10,708
[HIIRAGI laughing]

291
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,875
[AYAME gasps]

292
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,250
What the hell are you
doing up there? Get down!

293
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,541
What kind of language
is that? Ask nicely.

294
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,375
As to what I'm doing,
see for yourself!

295
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,333
I'm helping this little princes
stuck on the roof get down.

296
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,916
Oh, Princess!

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,791
Thank heavens you're been found!

298
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,208
[ATTENDANTS] Thank you
for saving her, Priestess!

299
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,833
Little Princess, you must
have had quite an ordeal.

300
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,000
Here, come with me.

301
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,000
No! I wanna stay
with Big Sister!

302
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,125
Would you look at that?

303
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,083
You've got yourself
another admirer.

304
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,333
Yeah, but she's
too young for me.

305
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:44,083
You ready to have some fun
with Big Sister? Here we go!

306
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,291
[HIIRAGI, PRINCESS laughing]

307
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,125
My sister's so annoying.

308
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,333
[YUZU]
Uh?

309
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,708
[SATSUKI] She always
manages to make herself

310
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,166
the center of attention.

311
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,291
She's wild and free-spirited.

312
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,416
People are drawn to her.
Everybody loves her.

313
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,625
Show off. I can't stand her.

314
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,791
You're really proud of
Hiiragi, aren't you?

315
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
[SATSUKI]
Maybe.

316
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,416
[YUZU] Satsuki looks
up to her big sister.

317
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,375
She's happy she's doing well.

318
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,083
And Hiiragi wants Satsuki
to be happy, too.

319
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,541
She wants her to be a
priestess like she is.

320
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,250
[SATSUKI] What brings you
to Konohanatei, sister?

321
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,083
Why are you really here?

322
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,875
[YUZU]
Satsuki may not say it,

323
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,333
but I think she loves Hiiragi,

324
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,500
and being near her
makes her happy.

325
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,000
Deep down, she misses her.

326
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,125
[wailing]

327
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,583
What's the matter,
Little Princess?

328
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,000
Please don't cry.

329
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,541
The princess wants to
see the <i>kagura</i> dance.

330
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,375
But there isn't time
to summon dancers.

331
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,208
We have to return to
the moon tonight!

332
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,375
[ATTENDANT A] We bunnies could
dance for you, Princess?

333
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,875
Would that suffice?

334
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,291
No! I want real <i>kagura</i>
dancers! I'm sick of bunnies!

335
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,458
Bunnies? That sounds
pretty cute.

336
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,666
What's with all the crying?

337
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
Well, uh.

338
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,416
Oh? You need <i>kagura</i> dancers?

339
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,916
Sure. We can handle that.

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,791
See, look. Ayame has both
our <i>chihayas</i> ready!

341
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,291
Yes.

342
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,416
Oh, no! I stayed in
the bath too long.

343
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,791
I can't seem to
stand up straight.

344
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,000
Someone else will have
to dance with you.

345
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,416
[HIIRAGI]
Careful. Don't fall!

346
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,125
I have an idea.

347
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,125
Satsuki, why don't you be your
sister's partner in my place?

348
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,333
Wait, what?

349
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,583
Great idea. I'm sure
that Satsuki can do it.

350
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,666
When we were little, she'd
pretend to be a priestess

351
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
and do the dances constantly.

352
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,500
[SATSUKI]
But... that was just a game.

353
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,958
It wasn't real.

354
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,166
[HIIRAGI]
You can do it.

355
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,250
You're a natural.
It's in your blood.

356
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,250
Besides, you'll have the
famous Hiiragi next to you.

357
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,166
Just do as I do
and you'll be fine.

358
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,125
But I'm... not a
priestess. I can't.

359
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,000
When a guest asks for something,
we can't refuse them.

360
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,125
That's what we do
here at Konohantei.

361
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,875
We treat our guests like gods,
whether they are or not.

362
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,666
So please dance with Hiiragi.

363
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,666
You're the only one who can.

364
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,958
[ALL gasp]

365
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,625
[HIIRAGI] A <i>kagura</i> dance is
like a prayer to the gods.

366
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,125
It honors them.

367
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,875
And prayer comes from the heart.

368
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,250
It's not a skill you can master.

369
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,166
Basically, it's the same thing
you do at Konohantei.

370
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,916
You honor your guests and
thank them for their patronage.

371
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,375
I know you can do it, Satsuki.

372
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,291
Bravo to both of you.
That was impressive.

373
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,291
Yes. Of course it was.

374
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,458
Right, Satsuki?

375
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,541
[HIIRAGI]
Satsuki?

376
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,208
[YUZU]
There you are!

377
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,416
Satsuki? Why'd you--?

378
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,041
[YUZU]
Uh, that was beautiful, Satsuki.

379
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,833
You should be proud of yourself.

380
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,000
You danced just like
a real priestess.

381
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,916
[SATSUKI]
Except I'm not!

382
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm not a real priestess,

383
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,291
and when I'm next to her,
it's even more obvious.

384
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,375
She the only reason I was able
to fake my way through that.

385
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,750
I know you can do it, Satsuki.

386
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,041
I hate her.

387
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,208
Why does she have
to believe in me?

388
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,083
I can't hold a candle to her.

389
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,750
No matter what I do,
or how much I practice,

390
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,750
put me next to her, and I'm
nothing more than a pale shadow.

391
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,375
She's got the real talent

392
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,666
and will always outshine
me in every way.

393
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,541
[MAN A]
The older girl is a genius!

394
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,458
The younger one's just
good at a lotta stuff.

395
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,375
That's what they
all used to say.

396
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,125
And I couldn't argue with
them because it was true.

00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,458

[YUZU]
Poor Satsuki.

401
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,416
She's worked so
hard for so long,

402
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,666
but she feels like she's
never good enough.

403
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,125
Anything she accomplishes
gets compared to her sister.

404
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:48,375
That must be so painful.
I can't even imagine.

405
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,958
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,166
I convinced you to do the
<i>kagura</i> dance with your sister

407
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,708
without thinking how
it'd make you feel.

408
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,041
[SATSUKI]
You didn't convince me.

409
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,875
I did my job,
of my own free will,

410
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,291
and that's all there is to it.

411
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,833
When a guest asks for
something, we can't refuse.

412
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,458
That's what we do
at Konohanatei.

413
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,458
[SATSUKI]
When all is said and done,

414
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,541
there's one thing
you gotta remember.

415
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,666
If the guest is happy, so am I.

416
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,458
[YUZU] Satsuki, can I
tell you something?

417
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,166
You should wear
makeup more often.

418
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,208
You're even prettier with it on.

Don't be stupid. Cut it out.

Hmph.

have to try and relax more.

[YUZU, SATSUKI]
You're welcome. Goodbye.

here in the first place?

[HIIRAGI]
You're a terrible liar.

00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,291
You weren't in the
bath too long.

[AYAME] Satsuki's very graceful
and she learns quickly.

00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,625
But considering she's

432
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,375
I'd expect nothing less.

433
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,583
I gave her some tips and
then she figured it out.

434
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,166
That girl's never had a
dance lesson in her life.

435
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,708
Man, what a headache.

436
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,625
[SATSUKI'S DAD] We'll send
Hiiragi to work at Konohanatei.

00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,250
[SATSUKI'S MOM] But dear,
though she's the eldest,

438
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,125
she doesn't know
her times tables.

439
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,708
Satsuki's smart and
she has so many gifts.

440
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,291
Hiiragi's more artistic.

441
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,708
Everyone expects her
to become a priestess.

442
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,333
Mother wanted Satsuki
to come work here

443
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,666
'cause she's a good girl who
knows how to follow the rules.

Satsuki's smart and she
stays outta trouble.

445

She's right, and you still
don't know your times tables.

[HIIRAGI] This is the job
I wasn't good enough for,

447
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,416
but Satsuki seems great at it.

448
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,291
It also looks like she's made
some pretty good friends here.

449
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,083
I thought maybe
her sour disposition

450
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,333
would have kept everyone away.

451
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,750
I was gonna invite her
to come to the shrine.

452
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,125
You going to tell her that?

453
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,166
Don't you think she deserves
to know the whole story?

454
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,000
[HIIRAGI]
What?

455
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,083
And admit our parents actually
think she's better than me?

456
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,083
You're crazy! No way in hell!

457
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,333
[AYAME]
All right.
