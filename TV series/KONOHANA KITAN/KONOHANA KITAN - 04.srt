to lay around all day

this mystery egg?

Hang in there, Ren.
It'll probably come off soon.

Just rest up, and don't worry

Poor Ren must be miserable.

I'm gonna work

And help her egg baby, too.

that to anyone else.

of the priestesses who danced

her name was Hiiragi

It didn't matter what I wanted.

They wanted my sister
to be the priestess.

[SATSUKI]
No.

All it would've done is
hurt you or our parents.

But what about you,
Satsuki? How do you feel?

I could never bring
myself to actually say it.

I thought it would be selfish.

which one of us it was.

If it didn't matter who...

Do you think
it's some kind of pig?

It can't be a
pig. It's all fuzzy.

Yeah, like a winter melon.

So we should call this

Hm.

By the way, I meant to ask.

You were having a bad dream

--Uh-huh.

that way, but I can't remember.

Really? That's good.

00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,375
But where did you leave
your kimono, dear?

Whatever am I
going to do with you?

Ah. What a nice day.

Oh. I see.

What's the matter, Shino?

You're all red.

Of course you are.

Why are you crying?

because I'll be grown up soon.

Excuse me, ma'am.

Come in, Big Sister.

Please sit down.

Sorry it's such a mess.

Are you planning on
making another new kimono?

[OLD WOMAN]
Yes, Mother.

387
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,375
And I know; I just made one.

388
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,166
But Shino keeps
growing so fast,

389
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,083
as soon as I finish them,
they're already too small.

going through her growth spurt.

00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,083

Beyond that, it seems she has

392
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,583
fallen in love, as well.

That man is attached
to his children.

He loves them so.

I can't imagine he'd
ever give her away.

it's best we keep it a secret.

[KIRI]
Yuzu.

You were raised, at least in
part, by humans, weren't you?

I was.

406
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,375
[KIRI] Then perhaps you've
heard about an old custom.

407
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,375
A mother, whose daughter
has died young, keeps a doll.

408
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,083
And she dresses it in
wedding clothes the way

409
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,250
she would have her child.

410
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,708
She does this so
her daughter might marry

411
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,333
in the afterlife.

412
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,541
Now, then.

413
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,375
What do you think
of this custom?

[YUZU sighs]

415
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,375
Do you think that
lady is wasting a lot

416
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,791
of time and energy on ghosts?

417
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,500
Do you feel sorry for her?

418
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,125
I think... if she wants
to see things a certain way,

419
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,583
then the world she
sees is real for her.

420
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,958
And besides.

421
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,250
Our guests are our gods.
It's not my place to judge.

Is anything the matter?

426
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,458
Because you don't look happy.

There you are, you tanuki.

Except, I am not
a tanuki. I'm a fox.

You've been lying to
my mother. Now stop it!

[KIRI] You seem to be in a
rebellious phase, Shino.

You couldn't have chosen a more
difficult age for a human to be.

You're keeping her here.

When are you going to set
her free from this place?

[KIRI groans]

436

[KIRI]
Your mother is a guest.

437
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,750
She came to Konohanatei and
walked through the front door

438
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,458
of her own free will.

439
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,291
I cannot simply kick her out.

440
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,583
Relax, Shino.

441
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,208
Why don't you try to
enjoy your time here, too?

442
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,291
You may like it.

443
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,750
[SHINO]
How am I supposed to do that?!

444
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,000
All of this is nothing
but a cruel dream!

445
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,125
And when my mother wakes up,
she'll be even more miserable!

446
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,875
[KIRI] There's something
you don't realize.

[GASPS]

448
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,958
The fleeting dreams one
has at Kononhanatei

449
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,291
can easily comprise the
entirety of a human life.

And they've become as real
to us foxes as they are

to your mother.

452
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,125
If she says "Oh, my!

What a lovely dream!"
Isn't that good enough?

00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,000
Or, at the very least, if
she doesn't mind it's a dream,

455
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,625
isn't that all that matters?

456
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,541
[SHINO WHIMPERS] You're right.
She should be happy.

457
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,541
Please don't tell
anyone what I said.

458
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,916
[SHINO] I can't seem
to stop making mistakes

and embarrassing myself in front
of everybody who works here.

460
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,125
But, Shino, that's
what growing up is,

461
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,666
and no one ever
said it was easy.

462
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,166
You make mistakes.

You regret all kinds of things.

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,125
But you learn from it all,
and you grow.

You grow until you
become a beautiful woman.

476
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,958
Aww!

477
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,708
Her mother finished her
wedding kimono this morning.

478
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,208
She said it was the last one.

479
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,666
What a fine and lovely day.

480
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,375
The Spring sky is fresh
and perfectly clear.

481
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,666
Just like the day you were born,
my darling daughter.

482
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,291
You look so beautiful...

483
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,708
...Shino.

484
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,583
Ever since I was
a baby, you said that

485
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,291
I belonged to the gods.

486
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,333
But I'm not theirs.

487
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,083
I've always been your daughter.

488
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,708
My life has been...
rich and full,

489
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,750
like a wonderful dream.

490
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,791
Thank you, Mother.

491
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,208
I love you.

492
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,333
[OLD WOMAN] I don't think I
can ever thank you enough.

493
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,541
All of you took such good care
of me and made me feel

494
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,041
so happy during my stay.

495
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,750
Truly, it was just like a dream.

496
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,125
Except that it wasn't a dream.

497
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,625
[OLD WOMAN]
Hmm?

498
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,541
[KIRI] From now on, you'll
always be with your daughter.

499
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,750
You'll never have to
say "goodbye" again.

500
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,166
The two of you will
be together for a long time.

501
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,750
Much longer than you were apart.

502
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,041
[gasps]

503
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,666
[whimpers]
Finally...

504
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,916
I'm so happy... What a
truly miraculous day...

505
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,500
[YUZU]
Ma'am? It's me again.

506
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,791
I brought your lunch.

507
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,666
I'm afraid you're too late.

508
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,750
Our guest has already left.

509
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,791
She has gone to go
be with her daughter.

510
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,541
Without eating first?

511
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,625
She must have been
in a terribly big hurry.

512
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,708
[chuckles]

513
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm disappointed
I couldn't see her off.

514
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,875
She was so nice.

515
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,250
Before she went, she did
want to thank all of us.

516
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,166
She said everyone
took good care of her and

517
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,041
the past few days
were like a dream.

518
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,458
[gasps]

519
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,041
[KIRI] Now, then, we've got
another banquet tonight.

520
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,541
It's going to be
a big job, Yuzu.

521
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,541
You ready?

522
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,958
[YUZU]
Yeah!
