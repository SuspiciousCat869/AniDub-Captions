to win that fight,

479
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,708
but he still
couldn't swing it.

480
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,041
In fact, he's never
taken a match.

481
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,208
Not one.

482
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,625
If you're talking about results,

483
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,125
he might as well have
just stayed home today.

484
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,750
But me?

485
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,500
I've seen how hard he trained
to get this far.

486
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,708
So I am gonna tell you
right now.

487
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,416
His work wasn't for nothing,

488
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,333
and I won't let
anyone say it was.

489
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,041
♪

490
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,791
You taught me
something important, kid.

491
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,083
When I saw you out there,
it got me thinking.

492
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,125
If I was a rookie
and that was me,

493
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,416
would I have been
willing to throw

494
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,208
everything away for my team?

495
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,791
Would I have had the guts
to try to pull one over

496
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,583
on the best in Japan?

497
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,125
Winning comes as easy
as breathing for me.

498
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,416
I never saw it
from your perspective.

499
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,833
But today,

500
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,375
you showed me that
a real badass goes all out,

501
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,875
no matter the cost.

502
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,833
And now I understand the weight
of a single victory.

503
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,375
Dachi High's on the ropes,
but we're not giving up.

504
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,791
We're not letting
his hard work go to waste.

505
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,666
This guy already gets it.

506
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,375
He's here trying to prove
that Tennoji's path was right

507
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,291
despite him losing
in the singles.

508
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,958
I made it this far following
the path that Hinomaru set.

509
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,416
So now,

510
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,083
with the fire my teammate
passed to me,

511
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,833
you're gonna get an ass-whooping
you won't forget.

512
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,458
This is a wheelchair
for sumo wrestlers, huh?

513
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,750
[ALL TOGETHER]
It's huge.
