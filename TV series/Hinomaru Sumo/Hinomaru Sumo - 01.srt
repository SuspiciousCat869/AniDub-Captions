[NARRATOR]
Sumo.

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,666
Since ancient times,
warriors clad in mawashi belts

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,833
have waged battles
within the ring.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,958
It is one of the few
combat sports

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,625
without weight classes.

6
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,916
Thus, student wrestlers
who are heavier

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,166
and larger in stature
have a distinct advantage

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,916
over the rest
of their competition.

9
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,708
Among them,

10
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,208
there are those
with the potential

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,041
to achieve the rank
of yokozuna.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,583
These athletes receive
the name of a sword

13
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,458
from Japan's National Treasures
as their moniker.

I'm thinking you and I

21

at the next stop.

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,916
I could see you clear as day.

About time you showed.
We got us a pervert.

[OFFICER] No kidding!
Where are your pants?

30
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,500
What're you talking about?
I meant the guy in the suit!

31
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,333
[OFFICER] Is this what kids
are into these days?

32
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,333
-Not wearing pants?
-You got the wrong idea!

33
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,750
I'm checking out a new school

34
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,083
and just wanted to make
a good first impression!

but it's already past noon.

38

Getting off the train
a station too early

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,916
really turned me around.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,416
And this map Kirihito drew me
isn't helping the situation.

Now, let's see.

45
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,916
The front gate's gotta be
around here somewhere.

Looks like
I didn't miss practice!

55
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,250
You mind if I join in?

Uh... hold up.

57
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,791
Incredible!

00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,791
I know I shouldn't
be surprised, but still!

59
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,333
They even have Sumo rings
built outside the dojo!

60
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,583
How ingenious.

61
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,041
The bale's a firehose
filled with dirt.

62
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,416
Yeah, the platform
is packed tight!

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm sorry. Who are you?

64
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,166
Oh. Guess I forgot
to introduce myself.

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,541
I got carried away when I saw
someone in a mawashi belt.

66
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,541
Sorry. I'm a third-year
middle schooler.

67
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,666
I came to check out your school
because of its sumo club.

68
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,458
The name's Hinomaru Ushio.
Good to meet ya.

69
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,208
Before I can be a yokozuna,

70
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,416
the highest rank
in all of sumo,

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,458
first, I have to be the best
high school wrestler there is.

72
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,958
[BOY 2]
Did he say yokozuna?

73
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,250
What's your name?

74
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,833
Oh. I'm Ozeki
from the sumo club.

75
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,000
I would love to have a bout
against someone driven enough

76
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,208
to be practicing
during their lunch break.

77
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,583
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What're you doing?

78
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,708
-Could you do me favor?
-Huh?

79
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,875
Hand me my bag.

80
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,708
I need my mawashi belt.

81
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,625
[OZEKI] Oh, sure.
Wait, you're changing out here?

82
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,791
[HINOMARU]
No one's looking.

83
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,333
[OZEKI]
One thing's obvious.

84
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,541
This dude's done
some major training.

85
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,458
But where'd he get
all those scars from?

86
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,125
If you're warmed up,
wanna start?

87
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,416
Uh, okay.

88
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,458
He's way intense about this.

89
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,458
All right.

Is that all you got?

92
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,083
You wanna see
what I'm made of?

Ow, ow, ow.

95
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,208
Not bad.

96
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,166
You didn't do so bad yourself.

97
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,625
[OZEKI] You said your name
was Ushio, right?

98
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,958
I'm kinda surprised
I never heard of you

99
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,458
from any tournaments before.

100
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,125
Yeah. Well, that's a long story.

101
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,041
I haven't done much competing.

102
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,750
Just a few back when I was
in elementary school,

103
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,833
that's all.

104
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,666
Oh, gotcha.

105
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,541
[OZEKI] Kinda feel like
I shouldn't have brought it up.

106
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,083
[HINOMARU]
But that's the whole reason

107
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,416
I want to enroll at this school.

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,125
Sorry for missing
the morning practice

109
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,041
and making a bad
first impression.

110
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,500
Morning practice?

111
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,958
You mean you're actually
joining the sumo club?

112
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,458
Of course I am!

113
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,208
-You're for real?
-Yeah.

114
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,000
[giggles]
I can't believe it!

115
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,541
We've got a new club member!

116
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,666
It's not a big deal.

117
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,875
It's so totally a big deal!

118
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,666
-[laughing]
-Well, before you pass out,

119
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,166
how about you take me
to see the dojo?

120
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,250
-Uh...
-Huh?

121
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,333
Um, you see, the thing
about the dojo is.

122
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,958
He was gonna find out
sooner or later.

123
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,958
Looks like the rest
of the club's inside!

124
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,833

-Hmm?

I didn't say
it would be pretty.

Uh...

129
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,625
I remember hearing this school

130
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,208
had its share of delinquents.

a delinquent, short stack?

[OZEKI] N-No one!
I just, uh...

136
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,416
[MAN 3]
Quit stuttering and speak up!

137

-Pick that up.
-Huh?

138
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,666
A dojo is treated with respect.

139
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,541
Do not defile it.
Pick up that trash right now!

140
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,541
Hey, dude. A word?

141
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,083
Do you know who you're
talking to, shrimp?

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,000
Not at all. Do you?

[MAN 6] What're you mongrels
howling about?

147
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,416
Yuma's back!

148
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,958
And here I was thinking
somebody had stopped by

149
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,375
looking for a fight.

150
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,416
How about you tell me
what's going on, Ozeki.

151
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,041
We... I... uh...

152
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,291
It was this half-sized punk!

Just came in
and started a fight,

154

no warning or anything!

155
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,375

and I'll just go ahead--

Lesson one:
you're an easy target.

00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,791
Hey, shrimp. Is everything
that idiot said true?

159
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,083
[HINOMARU]
Yeah, most of it.

I hope you know
what you're getting into.

00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,375
I got an idea what you can do
with your free time.

163
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
-Yeah?
-How about all of you take up

164
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,333
sumo wrestling instead?

165
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,291
Tons of fun. Well?

166
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,500
-[chuckles]
-[ALL laughing]

167
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,208
Fat guys hugging
isn't our idea of fun.

168
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,958
-Looks like he wants to fight.
-Um, hey! Yeah!

169
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,208
So sorry!
He didn't mean any disrespect!

170
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,791
Right on cue.
Odachi's resident coward.

171
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,875
-Odachi?
-The kid's a middle schooler

172
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,000
thinking about joining
the sumo club next year.

173
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,583
-He said Odachi High.
-We need to go! Like now.

174
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,666
[HINOMARU] Doesn't he even know
what school he goes to?

175
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
So, Yuma. What now?

176
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,791
[OZEKI] I really embarrassed
myself back there, huh?

177
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
What's the deal?

178
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,541
Why're you letting them
walk all over you like that?

179
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,791
It's just the way things are.

180
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,166
No one can stand up to Yuma

181
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,000
even though
he's only a second year.

182
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,750
Hmm.
I suppose knowing karate

183
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,625
would stop a lot of people
from talking back.

184
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,041
Wow, you could tell?

185
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,333
Yeah, the guy actually won
the Kanto tournament

186
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,958
back when he was
in middle school.

187
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,041
If those weren't club members,
where is everyone?

188
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,458
Well, after you join,

189
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,166
that'll make
a grand total of two.

190
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,333
Uh... the Ishigama High School
sumo club only has one member?

191
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,041
Uh, no. But the Odachi
High School club does.

192
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,666
Uh...
[screaming]

193
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,208
I was at the wrong school
the entire time?

194
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,291
[OZEKI] I think most people
would've noticed.

195
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,041
And probably used
the front gate.

196
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,958
[HINOMARU]
This was all a mistake.

197
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,375
Makes sense. For real though.

198
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,041
I mean, why would someone with
actual talent wanna enroll here?

199
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,000
Sorry I didn't pick up
on it sooner.

200
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,500
It's not your fault.

201
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,666
You deserve better.

202
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,291
A hot shot like you oughta
be going to a powerhouse school.

203
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,291
[HINOMARU] I could say
the same thing about you.

204
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,750
-Huh?
-I could tell from our bout.

205
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,458
It's your legs.

206
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,583
Obviously, you've put
in the time training.

207
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,500
That sumo ring, you're the one
who built it, right?

208
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,708
Oh, yeah.

209
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,541
There's not a weed
or pebble visible.

210
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,916
And like I said before,

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,583
the dirt's packed nice
and tight.

212
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,000
[HINOMARU chuckles]

213
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,375
I knew it from
the moment I saw you.

214
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,333
You're a sumo maniac,
just like me!

215
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,583
As long as you keep up sumo,

216
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,541
I know we'll see each other
in a tournament.

217
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,125
I can't wait for that day.

218
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,333
[chuckling]

219
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,000
No way. How did I end up
back at Odachi High?

220
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,166
Ozeki even drew me a new map.
I'm a mess.

221
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,000
Not to mention
I kept getting distracted

222
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,666
and used up the entire day.

223
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,708
Well, whatever.

224
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll just thank him
for the map and head home.

225
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,833
[HINOMARU]
What happened to your ring?

226
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,166
-[OZEKI] Ushio.
-It's destroyed!

227
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,541
There's nothing left!
Who did this?

228
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,875
Even the bale is in pieces.

229
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,458
Time to quit, huh?

230
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,083
I can't continue practicing sumo
at the school anymore.

231
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,750
I didn't care when they
called me lame or fatty

232
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,083
as long as I had this ring.

233
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,416
Some place of my own.

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
[voice breaking]
I really wanted to have

235
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,500
an official bout here one day.

236
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,375
Now it's gone.
They stole it.

237
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,125
Took it away from me!

238
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,458
Damn it!

239
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,291
[MEN laughing]

240
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,916
I tell you,
manual labor's sure tough.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,041
Yeah, but it feels good
working up a sweat.

242
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,541
How would you guys know?

243
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,791
[HINOMARU]
Hey!

244
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,041
That bag weighs a ton.
The hell's in there?

245
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,166
Well! Don't you feel any remorse
for what you did?

246
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,833
-Remember, God is watching!
-[MEN grunting]

247
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,083
-What're you talking about?
-Don't play dumb!

248
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,000
Your thugs destroyed
the sumo ring!

249
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,625
Ahh. Now things
are making sense.

250
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,250
Guess the boys got carried away.

251
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,333
Then it sounds like
it's your problem, you jerk!

252
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,541
Of course! I take responsibility
for their actions.

253
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,250
So, what you gonna do about it?

254
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,750
I want a duel!

255
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,500
If I win,
you have to give up the dojo.

256
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,291
A duel, huh?

257
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,125
Okay, but if we're gonna
do this,

258
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,041
-you play by my rules.
-Deal!

259
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,583
Then it's settled.

260
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
Good. See you at the dojo.

261
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,666
Sure. I'll be there
after I change!

262
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,791
-[YUMA] Better not run.
-You wish!

263
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,416
-You're gonna fight him?
-He gave me no choice!

264
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,083
I'm gonna win that dojo back
for the sumo club!

265
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,166
It's between me and him.
You'll be fine.

266
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,416
That's not what
I'm worried about right now!

267
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,791
You don't know
what kinda trouble

268
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,375
you've gotten
yourself into, man!

269
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,458
-Huh?
-We're talking about Yuma!

270
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,416
Playing dirty is his specialty!
Trust me on this!

271
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,833
He's going to do
whatever it takes

272
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,458
to make sure
he wins the fight!

273
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,375
That's it? No problem.

274
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,375
After all,
I'm gonna be a yokozuna.

275
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,541
What's with you?

276
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,208
I'm saying
don't take this lightly!

277
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,875
Would you stop talking about
being a yokozuna for one second!

278
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,833
You're not even tall enough
to look the dude in the eyes!

279
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,791
I'm sure
you know already, but...

280
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,750
you have be at least
a 167 centimeters

281
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,458
to pass the medical exam
and become a sumo wrestler.

282
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,833
And you look
to be shy of 160.

283
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,041
I know you love the sport,
but you can't be a pro-wrestler.

284
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,541
Much less a yokozuna.

285
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,333
Look, I hate being the one
who says this,

286
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
but there are some things
in this world

287
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,333
you have no control over!

288
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,041
[WOMAN] I'm sorry I couldn't
give you a bigger body.

289
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,875
[OZEKI] Anyway, you should go
while you still have a chance!

290
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,500
Okay? I'll see ya.

291
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,958
Like that's gonna stop me!

292
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,541
-Hmm?
-Huh?

293
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,541
So, you didn't run.

294
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,083
Where's your pint-sized amigo?

295
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,541
He's not going to show up.

296
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,625
-[YUMA] What?
-I'm asking you.

297
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,333
Please, let it go
just this one time!

298
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,083
Do what? He's the one who wanted
to fight in the first place!

299
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,625
I know and I'm sorry!

300
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,583
But I'll do anything you want
to make it up to you!

301
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,125
What kind of crap
are you pulling?

302
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,916
It's an interesting proposition.

303
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,083
-It is?
-So if I have this straight,

304
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,333
you'll do whatever I ask?

305
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,541
Uh, yeah.

306
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,041
I want you to give up sumo.

307
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,333
It's my life.

308
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,041
[YUMA] I'm not sure
how you know each other,

309
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,291
but you came here
to protect him, right?

310
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,458
Then you better be prepared
to lose something

311
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,208
of value in exchange.

312
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,000
[HINOMARU] I knew it
from the moment I saw you.

313
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,375
You're a sumo maniac,
just like me!

314
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,125
-Okay.
-Hmm.

315
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,541
From this day forward.
I'll never...

316
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,208
-[screaming]
-Huh?

317
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,416
You shouldn't make promises
you can't keep.

318
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,458
Well, ready when you are.

319
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,250
Ushio?

320
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,750
What's going on
with his outfit?

321
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,166
[MEN laughing]

322
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,125
[MAN 7] Someone tell him
his butt's hanging out!

323
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,041
[MAN 8] Maybe he wants to make
it easier for Yuma to kick it!

324
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,375
What the hell?
I told you to escape, dude!

325
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,583
Like I would ever
run away from a fight.

326
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,750
I imagine some people
would have taken your advice

327
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,458
and left you to the wolves,

328
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,291
but they could
never become yokozuna.

329
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,250
You need to have three things.

330
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,583
A strong spirit,
technique, and body.

331
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,166
And unfortunately,
I'm on the short side.

332
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,916
So I can't very well let
my spirit be weak, can I?

333
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:08,333
Ozeki. Don't let anyone
make you quit sumo.

334
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,083
-[clapping]
-Huh.

335
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,291
The kid's a poet,
not a fighter.

336
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,333
I mean, did you hear
that speech?

337
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,041
Lovely. Now then,
why don't we see

338
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,583
if your spirit is as strong
as you say it is?

339
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,000
If I remember right,

340
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,500
you said the fight
would be played by my rules.

341
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,000
-Ten minutes.
-[knuckles crack]

342
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,916
You just stand there.

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,916
And if you endure my punches
that long without fighting back,

344
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,416
you'll be declared
the winner.

345
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,750
Or as we like to call it

346
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,041
the famous Odachi High
human sandbag!

347
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,041
[OZEKI] What kind
of insane fight is this?

348
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,541
-Let's get it over with.
-Eh?

349
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,458
You're not going to back down
after hearing the rules?

350
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,375
All right!
[grunts]

351
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,708
[winces]

352
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,250
Hey, you'd better be counting
those ten minutes.

353
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,958
Just who the hell are you?

354
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,708
I'm Hinomaru Ushio.

355
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,250
And my name will echo
through history on the day

356
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,958
I become a yokozuna!

357
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,375
Listen up, you punks.

358
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,166
If you think you can beat me,
bring it on!

359
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,750
[HINOMARU] Don't retreat.
Don't back down.

360
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,416
The ring is four
and a half meters across.

361
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,458
Nothing exists outside of it.

362
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm taking this body
into fights where if one hand,

363
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,583
one knee touches
the ground, I lose!

364
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,458
If I can't win now,
then when will I?

365
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,333
Hey, there's something big
going down at the dojo.

366
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,583
You wanna go check it out?

367
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,416
[BOY 3]
The human sandbag again?

368
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,541
That's nothing new.

369
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,875
No, listen.

370
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,875
[BOY 3 gasps]
Are you serious?

371
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,250
[YUMA]
What's with you?

372
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,125
[grunting]

373
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,083
Break!

374
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,000
[groaning]

375
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,625
Damn you, kid!
What're you made of?

376
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,625
-[phone beeping]
-Uh?

377
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,125
-Time's up?
-That can't be right!

378
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,625
I even added five minutes
just to be safe!

379
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,625
-No way.
-[HINOMARU] Hey.

380
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,208
Maybe it's just me, but that
felt like more than ten.

381
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,125
[YUMA] What's it take
to knock you down?

382
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,625
That's a stupid question.

383
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,541
In sumo, you lose
if anything besides

384
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,291
your feet touches the ground.

385
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,875
I've worked hard
to make sure I never fall.

386
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,958
You didn't think
those weak punches of yours

387
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,750
were enough to put me down?

388
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,875
It's gotta be
some kind of trick!

389
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,916
No one messes with me!

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,666
Time's up, which means
I can fight back now.

391
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,250
Ahh!

392
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,291
I take it you've never
experienced sumo.

393
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,541
Ready for a taste?

394
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,166
-[yelling]
-Spirit.

395
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,791
[OZEKI]
Are you serious?

396
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,208
He just took down Yuma
with a single hit!

397
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,333
Hinomaru Ushio...

398
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,916
The two-time
elementary school champion?

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,208
He was so strong,
they gave him

400
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,625
the moniker of a demonic
national treasure.

401
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,208
Onimaru Kunitsuna!

402
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,083
-Uhh...
-[HINOMARU] So, Yuma,

403
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,416
-You appreciate sumo now?
-[YUMA groans]

404
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,666
We had a bet.
Take your flunkies and get lost.

405
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,791
You think
we're just gonna leave?

406
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,166
This isn't over until
you fight the rest of us!

407
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,708
What? You do know
what a duel is, right?

408
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,583
[MAN 8] There's no way
he can beat all of us!

409
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,791
-[ALL clamoring]
-[YUMA] All of you, shut up!

410
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,291
I had fifteen minutes,
and I couldn't drop him.

411
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,833
But he took me out in one hit.

412
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,583
I lost, and that's all
there is to it.

413
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,375
[YUMA]
Damn! How'd that shrimp beat me?

414
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,416
If you want the answer,
you should try the sport.

415
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,291
I'm gonna be
the best wrestler in Japan.

416
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,416
If you ever want a rematch,
I'll be happy to take you on!

417
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,458
Finally, a dojo.
It's like a dream!

418
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,125
[HINOMARU] Pinch yourself,
‘cause it's real.

419
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,625
Things should have
always been this way.

420
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,083
But still,

421
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,958
I can't believe
all this time you were Onimaru.

422
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,791
You told me there are
some things in the world

423
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,916
that can't be helped.

424
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,041
-Oh, yeah.
-This is what I'm going to do.

425
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,375
I'm going to win.
Then I'm going to win some more

426
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,458
until I'm the best high school
sumo wrestler there is.

427
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,125
That'll show everyone
it's not the size

428
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,625
of your body that counts.

429
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,083
And then...

430
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,791
I'll make
the professional sumo league

431
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,541
bow their heads to me!

432
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,583
You know what?

433
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,708
When you say it, I start
to think it might happen.

434
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,375
It's not something
I joke around about.

435
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,916
I'll see ya.

436
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,750
Please take one!

437
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,291
[MAN 9] Sign up right here
for the soccer club!

438
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,958
[MAN 10] Oh, so you're gonna
join the basketball club?

439
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,958
Smart choice!

440
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,750
-[BOTH grunt]
-Oh, sorry.

441
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,125
Didn't expect
to see you out here.

442
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't get
why you even bother.

443
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,000
No one's gonna join
your sumo club.

444
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,250
I'm gonna prove you wrong!

445
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,583
I think.

446
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,583
Maybe they'll end up
being right.

447
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,583
No! This year
it's gonna be different!

448
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,500
[HINOMARU laughs]
That's right!

449
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,250
The dojo's in terrific shape.

450
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,416
Ushio, what are you
doing back here?

451
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Well, there's not many
sumo maniacs like you around.

452
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,208
So I decided,

453
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,875
we're both gonna dominate
the competition this year.

454
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,125
You mean it?
You're joining the team?

455
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,625
I'll be counting
on you, Captain!

456
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,916
Yes! Great news!

457
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,666
You don't know how pumped
I am right now!

458
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,625
What do you say we celebrate
by having a match?

459
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,708
[OZEKI]
As captain, I totally agree!

460
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,041
[STUDENTS chattering]

461
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,375
[BOY 4] Really?
But he's so short.

462
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,833
[BOY 5]
I'm dead serious.

463
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:29,041
Not only that, he beat Yuma
before he enrolled.

464
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,875
Sounds like you got
a reputation.

465
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,500
[HINOMARU groans]

466
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,125
The boy from the train.
