00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,458
Oh no. You don't think
he secretly lusts after us

481
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,208
and now he wants us
to quit being managers

482
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,083
because we disrupt
his concentration?

483
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,791
I bet you anything that's it!

484
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,541
[REINA] Where the heck
did that come from?

485
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,833
All right, listen up.

486
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,125
If you've got something to say,
then come out and tell us!

487
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,083
I-- All right.

488
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,083
Reina, don't overstretch!

489
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,541
Okay! Perfect!

490
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,958
Good position, Hori!
She can't throw you now!

491
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah, I know
I was supposed

492
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,833
to forget that day,

493
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,041
but I just couldn't
get it outta my head!

494
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,500
So, what do ya say?

495
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,458
Are you two gonna
take up sumo for real?

496
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,541
[REINA]
Dream on.
