Now, Spirit!

Are these drills
or some form of mental torture?

00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,875
I'm keeping my back straight

19
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,583
and using my legs
to stabilize my strikes.

20
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,041
Apparently,
it'll prevent opponents

from knocking me
to the ground.

22

Who told you that?

No, wait, don't answer.
I already know. Him.

Why're you even taking orders
from that guy?

25
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,125
He makes you do
these insane exercises

26
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,250
while he just sits on his ass
the whole time and watches.

27
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,458
[YUMA]
Yeah.

28
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,833
I'm sure it probably
looks that way

-to an outsider.
-Huh?

30
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,916
To be honest,
I don't like him much either.

31
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,541
But it's for an entirely
different reason.

32
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,833
When we've got our backs turned,
he sticks his neck out for us.

33
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,500
But, hey.

34
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,458
I figure what he chooses
to do on his own time

35
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,125
is his own business.

36
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,625
And I don't listen to anyone
I don't agree with.

37
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,541
Thing is...

[CHIHIRO] If I'm gonna pull off
advanced techniques,

39
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,708
I gotta master my footwork.

40
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,750
Need to force my body
to remember,

41
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,666
this is a different beast
than the wrestling I'm used to.

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,291
Watch the fish bowl
and imagine it's the sumo ring!

43
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,083
[OZEKI] Holding a mouthful
of water trains me

to finish a match
as quickly as I can

45

while holding my breath.

46
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,291
When you break it down,
the exercise makes total sense.

47
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,125
Everybody's thinking
the exact same thing.

48
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,541
More than half the team's
never done sumo before.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,666
If we did training like
other teams of wrestlers,

50
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,750
we'd have zero chance
of becoming the best in Japan.

51
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,458
That's why we're taking
this route.

52
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,000
The drills may look bizarre,

53
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,291
but they're designed to help us
shake off anxieties

54
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,666
and hang-ups.

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,833
We're learning the guy

but it's not important.

As long as we feel it's right.

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,375
For me, my body's
telling me one thing.

59
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,166
If I follow him, ultimately,
I'll become stronger.

60
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,583
And does he feel the same way?

No, no.

Your movements
are becoming too erratic.

I mean, even your captain's
beating him.

65
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,166
This is supposed
to make him less anxious?

66
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,958
It is.
Take a look at his face.

One more time!

68
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
There's something
that I read a while back,

69
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,916
about how the best instructors
are the ones who are able

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,666
to instill a sense
of confidence in their athletes.

71
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,375
If that's true...

72
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,375
then he's a first-class coach.

be long until the tournament.

So, on our upcoming day off,
we're going to train

at Ishigami High School
in the next town over.

to win a bout

a first year.

in time
for the competition,

96
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,541
then you're going to need
to square off

of difficult opponents.

is only a first-year.

162
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,875
[KEI whimpers]
With bodies like those?

163
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,916
[OZEKI]
No. Don't get intimated.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
[MAN] You!
Who're you with?

165
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,666
Only club members are allowed
in the training yard.

166
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,875
Pardon.

167
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,125
You're Kanomori,
the club captain, yes?

168
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,666
We're sorry for barging in.

169
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,708
Huh?

170
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,583
[KANAMORI]
Practice with us?

171
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,125
First you waltz
into our club uninvited,

172
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,291
then you expect to us
to have bouts with you?

173
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,458
[OZEKI] Wait, you didn't
tell them we were coming?

174
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,625
So,

175
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,458
what school are you from anyway?

176
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,750
We're from Odachi High.

177
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,041
Dachi High?

178
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,916
I heard Onimaru is
enrolled there,

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,666
and he got Kuze
back in the ring.

180
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,583
Did you bring him along?

181
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,125
[KIRIHITO] He had
some things to take care of

182
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,250
and couldn't make it.

183

-Huh?
-[BOTH groan]

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
[KANAMORI] What good's
it gonna do us to practice

185
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,916
with your second-tier wrestlers?

186

[chuckles]

187
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,791
You think Onimaru's the only one
worth watching on our team?

188
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,833
Hey. Maybe we should
just quit while we're ahead.

189
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:35,833
Let's go back.

190
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,375
Relax, captain.

191
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,958
I'll handle this.

192
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,291
I've got practice dealing
with the easy-to-provoke type.

193
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,291

[grunts]

198
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,083
[KANAMORI]
That guy threw himself at a tire

199
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,750
that weighs
as much as any heavyweight

200
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,833
and managed to stop it dead
in its tracks.

201
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,333
[OZEKI]
For some reason, the impact

202
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,083
didn't knock me backwards.

203
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,333
Maybe all that seaweed
harvesting we've been doing

204
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,833
has increased
my core strength.

First-years!

206
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,166
I'm only gonna
tell you once, watch it!

207
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,875
[STUDENTS whimpering]
We're sorry!

208
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,000
Apologize to this guy, not me!

209
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,666
Oh, it's, you know,
not necessary.

210
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,666
[BOTH]
Please forgive us.

211
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,083
So what do you think
of our captain here?

212
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,791
I'd say Onimaru's not
the only wrestler on our team

213
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,458
you should be interested
in fighting.

214
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,458
Hmm.

215
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,291
Why don't we let them join in?

216
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,375
They bothered to come
all the way out here.

is going win me over.

219

But we do need to make up
for what happened.

Come on! Hurry up
before I change my mind.

Well, Onimaru.

00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,958
It's time we met.

224
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,666
What a waste.

225
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,166
I wanted to bring the hurt
on somebody today.

with the goldfish or something.

for the goldfish too?

I'm Gennosuke Araki, by the way.

I'm here scouting out your club.

Scouting, huh?

00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,666
I get it.
Drawn to a challenge.

256
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,625
Like a moth to match.

Wait. A flame?

You are?
That's perfect.

261
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,375
Man, and luck's
usually not on my side.

262
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,166
I didn't even have
to look that hard.

263
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,041
Wait, can't call myself lucky.

264
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,750
It's a long story.

265
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,208
Too complex for you.

266
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,375
But I wanna be the king
of mixed martial arts.

267
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,958
I was told Ishi High has
the strongest sumo club around,

268
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,250
so I jumped at the chance
to enroll there.

269
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,666
But then I heard about Onimaru
and how he went head-to-head

270
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,583
with Eiga High's
national treasure, Kusanagi.

271
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,833
Thought I'd come by
and size him up.

272
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,750
[CHIHIRO] Are people
really talking about that?

273
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,791
I was interested
in sparring with you,

274
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,500
but I'm wasting my time.

275
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,166
Do you even lift?

276
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,291
Obviously the stories I heard
about you were exaggerated.

277
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,708
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
calling you weak or anything.

278
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,458
But if you gave Kusanagi
a run for his money,

279
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,833
well, you must be the one
with all the luck.

280
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,000
Hey.

281
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,791
Good fortune can be
considered a skill

282
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,250
if you don't have any others.

283
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,333
Guess if I want to fight
someone worthy,

284
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,166
I'm gonna have to wait
for nationals to roll around.

All right, then.
Don't believe your eyes.

288
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,000
But trust me when I say this.

289
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,625
If you came here

00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,250
today is your lucky day.

291
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,125

Well then,

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,708
I think our team's warmed up

297
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,208
and ready to start sparring now.

298
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,708
Okay.

299
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,458
You'll be the first
one up, Gojo.

300
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,958
Yeah.

301
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,208
Then Mamiya will start for us.

302
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,000
-Get in there.
-[MAMIYA] Got it.

303
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,666
[KIRIHITO] Keiichi Mamiya,
second-year heavyweight.

304
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,875
One hundred eighty-two
centimeters tall.

305
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,416
Weight, 166 kilograms.

306
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,250
The real question is
how effective

307
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,708
are Gojo's karate slaps
going to be against him?

308
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,000
[YUMA]
He's a mountain.

309
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,041
And up close,
he's even more intimidating.

310
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,250

Spirit!

311
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,708

There it is.

312
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,708
My slap actually
pushed him back.

313
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,666
[KIRIHITO]
Gojo.

314
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,708
A minute of your time?

315
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,791
During matches, you should avoid
grabbing your opponent's belt.

316
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,166
What are you talkin' about?

317
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,041
That's like
a fundamental of sumo.

318
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,583
Wrestling like everyone else

319
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
won't give you edge
you need to win, though.

320
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,083
What I'm saying is you have
to play to your strengths.

321
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,583
Karate?

322
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,041
[KIRIHITO]
Listen closely.

323
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,333
I want you to fight
to your heart's content.

324
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,625
[YUMA]
It's working.

325
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,541
Thanks to my training,
I can match my strikes

326
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,375
to my opponent's movements

327
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,375
and never miss.

328
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,666
Whoa!
Rough around the edges,

329
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,083
but his strikes have
a kind of raw energy to 'em.

330
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,916
Yeah. They're way too good

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,833
for someone
who's just starting out.

332
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:04,916
But still.

[MAMIYA]
I was going easy on you

334
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,500
'cause you were a beginner.

335
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,375
[YUMA]
This isn't good.

336
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,750
Once Mamiya grabs your belt,

337
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,333
it's pretty much over with.

[MAMIYA grunting]

No, Yuma!

Damn it!

341
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,333
[KIRIHITO]
He'll need more work

342
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,541
before that tactic is effective.

343
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,208
Club captain Kanamori,

344
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,916
vice-captain Sanada,
and this Mamiya guy?

345
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,791
Obviously, all three are going
to the tournament

346
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,333
and we'll have to fight
them down the road.

347
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,333
And there's him.

348
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,583
Ishi High has
that other fighter.

349
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,958
But who'll be
their fifth member?

350
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,708
Someone stronger?

351
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,791
[CHIHIRO]
A one-arm shoulder throw!

352

Whoa, he knows Judo?

353

If that's the way
you want to play it.

-[ARAKI] What?
-[CHIHIRO] Strongest!

355

They're awesome.

Liar.

359
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,958
You're not Onimaru.

360
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,833
[CHIHIRO]
Oh. That was a test.

361
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,500
-You passed.
-Huh?

362
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,791
Your techniques are different.

363
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,125
And you're like twice as tall

364

Just when I thought
my luck was changing.

So, who are you, really?

I'm Chihiro Kunisaki.

in the entire world.

373

You're like me.

-Uh, you're like me, Gengoro.
-Who's "Gengoro"?

376
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,416
Using sumo to get better
at martial arts was all my idea!

377
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,750
Back up! It's Gennosuke!

-Me! I'm Araki Gennosuke!

You know,
maybe it was luck

I met you after all, Chiharu.

It's Chihiro!

I'll show myself out.

Later.

[MAN continues shouting]

391
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,208
[CHIHIRO] Only one month
before the Inter High prelims.

392
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,375
I need more time.

393
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,500
If I'd studied,
I could be over at Ishigami

394
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,916
with the others
training right now.

395
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,333
I'm never failing
another test again.

396
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,458
Okay, captain.

397
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,791
Enter the ring.

398
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,875
Um, sure.
I'll give it my all.

399
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,250
[KANAMORI] He stopped
that tire single-handedly.

400
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,083
I'd have to guess he's the
strongest member they brought.

401
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,125
-In that case, I'll send out--
-Hey, sweet.

402
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,125
Looks like we're having
training bouts, huh?

403
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,458
You punk!

404
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,208
You think you can just
stroll into practice

405
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,250
whenever you want, huh?

406
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,250
I showed up, didn't I?

407
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,958
The guy from earlier.

408
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,791
He could've told us
he was in the club.

409
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,958
Come on, captain,
I wanna have a turn.

410
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,083
Put me in the ring
and let's see what happens.

411
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,625
You're late, then you
ask me for a favor?

412
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,625
The only thing you're doing
is groin stretches

413
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,666
for the next hour!

414
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,958
Ah!

415
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,666
But you know I have
trouble with those.

416
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,500
I'm begging you, captain.
Have a heart.

417
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,083
What's the harm in
letting him play this match?

418
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,416
Let's be honest here,

419
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,291
how often does he feel
like doing anything?

420
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,750
Don't keep motherin' him.

421
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,458
He's never gonna learn
at this rate.

422
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,291
Sanada, you big softie.

423
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,791
Seems they chose your opponent.

424
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,291
You got this one
in the bag, Ozeki.

425
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,250
That's Mizuki Sada.

426
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,416
Or rather Mikazuki Munechika.

427
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,708
-[REINA] Uh?
-[BOYS] Huh?

428
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,250
[OZEKI]
But he seems so easy-going.

429
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,458
How am I supposed to beat
a national treasure?

430
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,250
When it comes to a tournament,
we need to win three bouts

431
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,125
to defeat their school
and move on.

432
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,916
Now let's assume that
Hinomaru and Kunisaki win

433
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,500
their matches
without a problem.

434
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,375
That still means at least one
of you needs a victory.

435
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,125
or the path to nationals ends
right then and there.

436
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,750
I want to win, but how?

437
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,625
Remember during practice?

438
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,833
You were able to keep up
with Hinomaru, weren't you?

439
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,708
That wouldn't have happened
if you weren't getting better.

440
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,166
[OZEKI] Does Tsuji
really believe I can do this?

441
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,791
Hmm?
[chuckles]

442
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,125
[OZEKI]
He thinks he can mock me

443
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,708
cause he's
a national treasure?

444
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,708
I'll show him how hard
I've been training!

445
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,750
You're not getting
a hold of my belt.

446
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,791
Oh, man.
He's just toying with Ozeki.

447
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,958
You're bigger than he is,
so what're you waiting for?

448
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,958
Knock the living crap outta him!

449
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,166
[OZEKI]
I hear you.

450
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,250
But if I miss,
then it's over with!

Hey, wait, I know that guy.

452
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,333
We were on the same sumo team
in middle school,

453
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,375
but the dude never won
a single bout.

454
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,833
How pathetic.

455
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm surprised
he hasn't quit already.

I don't even know how to win.

to do to bring down

Get your head in the game!

with Hinomaru!

No matter
how many times we spar,

I'll never beat you.

469
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,708
We finally have enough members
to compete for real,

and I'm holding everyone back.

You want me to stop, then don't
sell yourself short anymore.

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,708
You're stronger than you know.

480
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
[OZEKI]
If that's what Ushio believes,

481
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,041
I just need to grab his belt!

482
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,125
He recovered his stance
from that position?

483
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,166
[OZEKI]
I can do this!

484
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,750
[groaning]

485
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,625
What's that?

486
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,583
He's trapped in an arm hold.

487
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,041
It's a maneuver that immobilizes
an opponent's attack.

488
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,583
And given his abilities,

489
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,333
there's no doubt
it's extremely painful.

490
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,208
He's got Ozeki
right on the joint.

491
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,833
When he uses that technique,

492
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,666
nobody can grab
his mawashi belt.

493
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,208
His opponents can't even get
anywhere near it.

494
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,833
You know, you'd think
sooner or later,

495
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,541
people would realize there's
a reason it's so pristine.

496
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,083
[OZEKI groaning]

497
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,750
[SADA]
It was good try.

498
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,458
You almost got your hands on it.

499
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,833
[OZEKI]
This hurts so much.

500
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,041
I can't even breathe.

501
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,958
Push away from him, quick!

502
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,041
Man, props for not breakin' yet.

503
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,791
Because of our water training.

504
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,958
[OZEKI]
I don't want to lose.

505
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,250
I have keep fighting
and get stronger.

506
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,583
Otherwise, I can't go
to nationals with Ushio!

507

[OZEKI grunting]

508
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,791
You got this, captain!

509
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,791
Keep pushin' him outta the ring!

510
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,875
How long you
gonna mess around?

511
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,958
Finish it!

512
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,250
Know what?

513
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,708
You didn't do half bad.

[groaning]

00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,333
What kind of move was that?

517
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,333
He threw the captain
like it was no big deal.

518
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,833
Do me a favor.

519
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,000
Onimaru Kunitsuna.

520
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,333
Give him a message for me.

521
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,166
Just tell him
I'm looking forward

522
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,666
to facing him in the ring.

That's Kirihito for you.

Where is he?

That jerk's always running late.

531
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,958
Some nerve.

532
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,208
Especially when we went
out of our way

533
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,583
to be friendly to him.
