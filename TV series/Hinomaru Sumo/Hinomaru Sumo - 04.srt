it becomes the same width

That may be how
you want to fight,

but isn't there a more
practical way of winning?

Just because you work hard

you'll be successful.

I've heard it before.

it takes to become a sumo pro.

Are you aiming
for the sekitori level?

My goal is mixed martial arts,
not sumo. But check it.

105
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,750
To go pro, the wrestlers have
to pass a physical exam.

106
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,666
The minimum height
is 167 centimeters.

no matter how hard he trains.

It's totally unfair.

111
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,958
Then why's he keep
pushing himself?

112
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,375
Is it just because
he loves sumo that much?

113
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,166
Where on earth does the kid find
that kind of motivation?

Your legs are strong, captain.

However, your upper body
is weak.

You didn't push him back

Yeah, you'd think so.

324
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,125
But using that move
has a huge risk.

325
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,875
Huh? How come?

326
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,208
[OZEKI]
Think about it.

327
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,666
It's difficult enough
combining two moves.

328
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,250
Imagine adding one more.

329
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,500
There's no coming back
after that.

330
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,666
If it doesn't work,
then you're outta options.

331
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,416
So this secret weapon
could still end up

332
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,375
costing him the entire match.

333
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,708
Is it really worth it?

334
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,083
Thank you, Kirihito.

335
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,750
It's a gamble
I'm willing to take.

336
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,833
Used to be a time

337
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,833
I rejected your sumo.

338
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,375
Now, I want to see more.

339
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,666
Hmm?

340
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,791
[KIRIHITO]
Charging at titans

341
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,458
and knocking them
to the floor.

342
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,791
It'll have its very own name.

343
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,458
Hinomaru Sumo.

344
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,958
Got a nice ring to it.

345
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
[KIRIHITO]
Do me a favor.

346
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,958
Clean up while
I catch my breath.

347
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,250
Great news!

348
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,291
I guess you get to be
bench warmer after all!

349
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,833
That was so incredible!

350
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,875
He's a great coach
and an amazing wrestler.

351
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,833
Dachi might just become
the best sumo school in Japan.

352
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,166
Oh. His glasses.

353
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,708
Mister Tsuji!

354
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,625
Group competitions
are gonna be a breeze!

355
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,208
Me, Hinomaru, and the Prof
are sure-fire wins!

356
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,958
Hey!

357
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,791
[HINOMARU] Unfortunately,
that's not gonna happen.

358
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,833
-Uh.
-Oh!

359
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,666
Uh!

360
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,791
[HINOMARU] Kirihito can't
compete in group competitions.

361
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,333
So, now you know
what my flaw is.

362
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,208
[HINOMARU]
He's got weak lungs.

363
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,666
Even though sumo bouts
typically don't last long,

364
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,958
they're super intense.

365
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,166
Twenty seconds.

366
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,416
That's his limit.

367
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,750
The amount of time
that his lungs will hold out.

368
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,916
No.

369
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,958
You can't.

370
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,875
[KIRIHITO]
Any longer than twenty seconds,

371
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,333
I'll drown.

372
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,416
There's no way I could last
an entire tournament.

373
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,166
Not when there's
several bouts day.

374
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,666
I cursed fate
for making me this way.

375
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,541
Lost the will to keep going.

376
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,833
Even quit sumo.

377
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,375
But then,

378
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,625
I saw something.

379
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,791
An idiot who had every right
to give up like I did,

380
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,333
yet continued fighting.

381
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
I felt pathetic.

382
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,750
I couldn't do sumo,

383
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,875
but I had to find a way
to stay involved.

384
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,375
That's why you want to coach?

385
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,583
Yes.

386
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,541
Because I want to see
Hinomaru succeed.

387
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,875
You never gave up!

388
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,416
But how can someone like me

389
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,791
who's not even at
the starting line compete?

390
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,833
Accept it.

391
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,791
You're a sumo wrestler, Kei.

392
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,833
After practice.

393
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,958
I've seen you,
training in the park.

394
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,291
I-I only do that
because I feel like

395
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,416
I'm falling behind
the others and need to.

396
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,583
The club's fifth member...
is you, all right?

397
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,125
Man, talk about a tough break.

398
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,583
Not able to compete just 'cause
of something you can't help.

399
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,791
Well, Hinomaru's in
the same boat, you know?

400
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,166
-Hmm?
-Come on.

401
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,625
Everybody here knows you're
too short to be a professional.

402
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,916
-Seriously, dude?
-So why?

403
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,041
Why train for something
that's never gonna happen?

404
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,625
[KIRIHITO]
I'll tell you.

405
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,708
He doesn't meet
the pro league requirements,

406
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,750
but there's still a way
he can join it.

407
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,166
How?

408
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,833
The student who wins
the inter-high

409
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,041
is named
the high school yokozuna.

410
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,625
They're invited
to participate

411
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,416
in the All-Japan
National Championships.

412
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,541
Never heard of it before.

413
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,416
It's a tournament
for amateur wrestlers,

414
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,708
including everyone from
college students to adults.

415
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,666
If you're the winner,
you receive preference

416
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,458
and enter
the Makushita division.

417
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,291
And preference is what?

418
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,916
It's a system
for all incoming members.

419
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,083
Normally, you'd
start off unranked.

420
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,125
But the champ skips ahead
several divisions

421
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,166
right up to Makushita.

422
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,166
Hmm. But I still don't see

423
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,250
how that makes
Hinomaru tall enough.

424
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,666
Yeah, I was wondering
about that too.

425
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,875
[KIRIHITO]
Captain.

426
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,041
The rule, there's more
to it than that.

427
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,333
Once an amateur wrestler
receives preference,

428
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,250
they aren't required to pass
any physical exams.

429
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,083
So height doesn't matter.

430
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,750
But in order to do that,
you're going to have to be

431
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,666
the best high school
sumo wrestler.

432
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,958
I'm asking you.

433
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,833
Will you please allow me
to be your coach?

434
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,166
All I want is for him
to realize his dream.

435
00:18:56,041 --> 00:19:00,083
I was in a bout with a student
from another school.

436
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,791
I realize that I went
against your wishes.

437
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,583
I ask your forgiveness.

438
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,333
[YAMATOKUNI]
And how was it?

439
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,333
It felt good to remember
how much I love sumo.

440
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,541
There's other competitors
out there

441
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,250
that I'm dying
to meet in the ring.

442
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,833
I want to defeat
every one of them

443

and become the top
high school sumo wrestler.

Then turn professional

445

and show I am the son
of Yamatokuni.

expressed your own dreams.

00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,458
Way more than I expected.

This is getting good!

468
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,291
I planned to cut them
down to size

and earn a yokozuna belt.

470

00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,750
Please help us
get to that point.

484
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,916
Ozeki.

485
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,166
Prepare for hell
starting tomorrow morning.

486
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,833
Like that's supposed
to scare us.

487
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,541
We'll work hard!

488
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,791
[KIRIHITO] Looks like
we're harvesting seaweed again.

489
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,083
[KEI]
Again?

490
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,416
Just remembering it
makes me want to...

491
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,541
[YUMA]
No puking in the ring, peewee!

492
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,333
[YUMA]
That isn't chankonabe.

493
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,875
It's a bowl
of disgusting seaweed!

494
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,708
Every meal's a banquet
with your team!

495
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,875
[CHIHIRO]
Delicious!

496
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,333
I keep seeing
that cat everywhere.

497
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,125
Who's he belong to?

498
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,958
I think he's a stray who just
likes to hang around the school.

499
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, you talking about Chanko?

500
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,500
Why do you get to name him?

501
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,750
[purring]

502
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,500
He likes Yuma!

503
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,416
So it seems.

504
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,291
[chuckles]
Chanko!

505
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,333
[screeches]

506
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,250
He doesn't like you.

507
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,750
That's putting it mildly.

508
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,958
[CHIHIRO grunts]
