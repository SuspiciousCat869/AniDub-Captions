Sumo.

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,666
Since ancient times,
warriors clad in mawashi belts

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,833
have waged battles
within the ring.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,958
It is one
of the few combat sports

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,583
without weight classes.

6
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,916
Thus, student wrestlers
who are heavier

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,166
and larger in stature
have a distinct advantage

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,000
over the rest
of their competition.

9
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,625
Among them,

10
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,208
there are those
with the potential

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,041
to achieve the rank of yokozuna.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,583
These athletes receive
the name of a sword

13
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,458
from Japan's National Treasures
as their moniker.

14
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,666
This is it.

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,791
Indeed.

You don't actually expect us
to just jump in

19

with their team?

20

Wait out here if you want.

21
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,875
But... Tsuji! Hold on!

the top schools in Japan.

about going to the nationals.

on entering a tournament,

but as things stand,

34

you'd be eliminated
in the first round.

[yelling]

323
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,333
[EIGA WRESTLER]
He lifted him off the ground!

324
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,791
[KARIYA]
Here it comes!

325
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,833
First he'll arch his back.

326
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,625
Then he'll extend his knees.

327
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,125
You're done!

328
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,541
A leg trip!

329
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,708
Damn, he's good!

330
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,458
[KEI]
It's over!

331
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,791
What the hell?

332
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,625
Demon Wheel!

333
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,750
-[OZEKI] He recovered!
-Uh!

334
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,875
[yelling]

335
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,458
-Demon Storm!
-Uh!

336
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,958
-No way!
-Oh, wow!

337
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,333
[BOTH grunting]

338
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,833
[KARIYA]
That didn't work either!

339
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,833
[KARIYA yelling]

340
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,416
[KIRIHITO]
He can't use Demon Wheel,

341
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,166
and Demon Storm
isn't strong enough.

342
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,166
[yelling]

343
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,583
[HINOMARU] If neither move
works separately,

344
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,875
then I've only got one choice!

345
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,708
I'll use them together!

346
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,083
Hundred Demon Takedown!

347
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,750
[growling]

348
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,166
[HINOMARU]
Kuze!

349
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,125
I won't let anything stop me.

350
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,541
I'm gonna reach the peak
of professional sumo

351
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,166
and be a yokozuna.

352
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,958
But what about you?

353
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,250
You're fine just being
the son of one!

354
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,166
You're kidding!
His dad's...

355
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,583
Oh, crap.

356
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,166
Ha!

357
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,166
But you said...

358
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,916
[KARIYA]
You're strong, Hinomaru.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,125
But you're about to run
head first into a brick wall.

360
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,333
You just woke a sleeping giant.

361
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,625
And his name is Sosuke Kuze!

362
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,208
[REFEREE]
Spirit!

363
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,791
The impact sent him
flying backwards!

364
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,625
-Whoa!
-[REINA gasps]

365
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,958
His punches are insane!

366
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,791
[KARIYA]
He's using that grip?

367
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,416
[HINOMARU groaning]

368
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,333
[KARIYA] What set Kuze off
to make him this bloodthirsty?

369
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,875
He's gonna break his arm!

370
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,541
[yelling]

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,416
The pain alone would make
most people try to pull free,

372
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,791
but he moved closer
and forced a release!

373
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,291
[growling]

374
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,708
[KUZE]
Father.

375
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,708
[YAMATO]
Our son is exceptional.

376
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,708
[KUZE]
Not just me.

377
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,708
There's another!

378
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,416
A Yakusugi sapling!

379
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,000
-Uh!
-A forearm thrust counter!

380
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,291
[KARIYA]
They're chest-to-chest!

381
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,625
[KIRIHITO]
It comes down to this.

382
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,125
[KARIYA]
It's about to get ugly!

383
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,125
[yelling]

384
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,208
[yelling]

385
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,250
[HINOMARU]
Hundred Demon Takedown!

386
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,250
[KUZE]
Great Serpent Cleaver!

387
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,666
Yomoda!

388
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,666
-What's going on?
-That's not good.

389
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,666
-Uh!
-Training's over.

390
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,291
[man] I told you already,
the yokozuna let his son join

391
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,125
on the condition he wouldn't
compete in any bouts.

392
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,916
And you go behind my back?

393
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,125
[BOTH breathing heavily]

394
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
[KEI]
Wow.

395
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,166
Talk about gloomy.

396
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,000
Ushio.

397
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,666
[KUZE] Today was the first time
I disobeyed my father.

398
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:02,000
A yokozuna's word is absolute.
Not to be challenged.

399
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,166
Why'd you do it, Sosuke?

400
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,208
[KUZE]
I don't know.

401
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,708
I just felt like I needed
to go up against him.

402
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,125
So, in other words,

403
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,458
he gave you your fire back.

404
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,333
[HINOMARU]
If the fight had gone on

405
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,958
and we weren't stopped,

406
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,208
I would've...

407
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,666
[KIRIHITO]
Come on, quit brooding.

408
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,250
Your "head-on" yokozuna-style
approach was a stupid idea.

409
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,541
And yet, it suits you best.

410
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,500
So I'll just have
to teach you...

411
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,166
how to win
while still being

412
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,000
a complete idiot.

What? Idiot?

414
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,333
[HINOMARU]
Then you pull and you're done!
