a dead man's blood pumping!

-Yup.

And based on that, I suppose
you've finally managed

00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,625
to solve the food riddle
as well.

[HINOMARU]
Yes, sir.

491
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,833
The challenge was to take
a hundred-yen

00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,125
and come back
with tempura over rice.

You never said
that I had to make it.

was one phone call.

I've got only one thing to say
to you, little demon!

It's only right that
I reward you for it.

507
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,541
I asked him to make
the trip out here

508
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,166
so Hinomaru can have one,

Man, you didn't even last
five seconds.
