[NARRATOR]
Sumo.

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,666
Since ancient times,
warriors clad in mawashi belts

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,833
have waged battles
within the ring.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,958
It is one of the few
combat sports

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,583
without weight classes.

6
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,916
Thus, student wrestlers
who are heavier

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,208
and larger in stature
have a distinct advantage

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,000
over the rest
of their competition.

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,666
Among them,

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,208
there are those
with the potential

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,041
to achieve the rank
of yokozuna.

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
These athletes receive
the name of a sword

13
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,458
from Japan's National Treasures
as their moniker.

Owie ow ow.

Well, looks like I'm still
no match for ya.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,333
I can tell you've spent a bunch
of hours working on the basics.

18
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,416
You've been holding your own
during our matches.

19
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,958
I can't believe I get to do sumo
in the dojo again.

[OZEKI]
Yuma and his thugs

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,666
were using it
as a personal hangout

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,500
before our latest club member
went head-to-head

23
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,625
with him and won it back.

24
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,583
Man, I need an official bout!

25
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,791
Hey, cap!

When's the next tournament
coming up?

27
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,166
Hey, I'm dying to compete, too,

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,083
but our club still only has
two members in it.

29
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,291
We're gonna need at least
three more people to join us

30
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,000
before we can enter
any tournaments.

31
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,083
Then there's nothing
to worry about!

32
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,375
Because we're gonna get a ton at
the club sign-up day tomorrow.

33
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,541
What makes you think
that's gonna happen?

34
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,875
I've got a plan.

35
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,791

[OZEKI]
Okay?

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,750
What goes hand-in-hand
with sumo?

38
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,416
Chankonabe stew, of course!

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,333
When they get a taste,
we'll have to turn people away!

Sure were howling
in your sleep, Yuma.

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,291
Probably having nightmares
about getting

his ass kicked
by a freshman.

I'll be happy to take you on.

He's out of his mind
if he thinks

00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,000
he'll be the best in Japan.

54

Nothing better than working up
a sweat on the soccer field!

I hate to say it,
but I'm getting the feeling

00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,250
high schoolers aren't
into sumo these days.

It's a lawsuit
waitin' to happen!

What could you even put in here
to make it taste this bad?

these flyers to.

Different combat sports
would boost my prospects.

164
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,750
So he's the strongest guy
in our school?

165
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,541
Even more than Yuma?

166
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,125
Strong, yeah, but, uh...

167
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,416
[ANNOUNCER] Wait!
I don't believe my eyes!

168
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,416
The champion's giving the loser
a lesson in where he went wrong!

169
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,458
He's pretty much the most
obnoxious guy I've ever met.

170
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,875
Odachi High's own
Mr. Untouchable.

171
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,875
Still, he's in
a combat sport, like us.

172
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,375
And check out the crowd.

173
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,625
They're totally into the show!

174
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,958
[BOY 4]
He's unbeatable.

175
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,125
Who is crazy enough
to challenge him next?

176
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,625
We have a volunteer
from the sumo club?

177
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,541
Did he say?

178
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,166
Good. I've been waiting for you.

179
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,791
I don't care about sumo.

180
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,541
On the other hand,
your enthusiasm intrigues me.

181
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,458
Um, hey, Ushio.

182
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,541
Isn't it tragic, captain?

183
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,583
Everyone writes off sumo
before giving it a chance.

184
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,625
But maybe they need an up close
and personal demonstration.

185
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,041
And then they'll finally
appreciate it!

186
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,875
[sighs]

187
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,500
-[BOY 5] Hey, did you hear?
-Hmm?

188
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,041
That short kid
from the sumo club

189
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,333
is taking on Chihiro
in a one-on-one!

190
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,958
[BOY 6]
What? You're kidding.

191
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,291
The freshman?

192
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,541
Who beat Yuma?

193
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,541
Yeah. Back when Yuma
was considered

194
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,583
the strongest guy at Dachi High.

195
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,416
Does that shrimp have
a death wish or something?

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,083
I'm going to bring sumo to you.

197
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,166
I want you to see it in person.

198
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,541
Up close.

199
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,791
I invited you, after all.

200
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,750
But what about your rituals?

201
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,500
I mean, can you do sumo
in any old gym?

202
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,416
[HINOMARU] Professional sumo
is part ritual,

203
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,875
but it's also
part entertainment.

204
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,000
Down the road, I'm going
to have to put on a show

205
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,625
for a packed Kokugikan Arena.

206
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,208
I see this as good practice.

207
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,375
You're actually game,
aren't you?

208
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,000
[OZEKI]
H-Hey.

209
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,291
Are you sure
you wanna do this, brosef?

210
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,291
I mean, we're talking about the
national wrestling champ here.

211
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,458
Beating him would make
our club look good, but...

212
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,375
-I'm sorry if I lose.
-Huh?

213
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,125
Promotion is partly why
I'm doing this,

214
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,750
but it's also
a rare chance for me

215
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,541
to face a top-class athlete.

216
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,000
I want to see if I have
what it takes to win.

217
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,958
Fighting him will
make me stronger.

218
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,958
Stronger?

219
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,791
[HINOMARU]
Besides, wrestling matches

220
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,666
take place inside of a ring
using only your bare-hands.

221
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,458
It's not that different
from sumo.

222
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,958
Wrong. They're nothing alike!

223
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,958
With throws in judo
and pin falls in wrestling,

224
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,000
you're vulnerable
to a fatal blow.

225
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,708
You're completely defenseless.

226
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,708
Now let's take a look at sumo.

227
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,041
If you leave the ring, you lose.

228
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,666
If your hand touches
the ground, you lose.

229
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,708
What a waste of a fight.

230
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,375
A sumo victory is just so lame.

231
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,083
You can't be called
a true winner

232
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,208
until you've subdued
your opponent.

233
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,333
I'm gonna be
a mixed martial artist,

234
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,750
so compared to that, your sport
seems kind of wimpy to me.

235
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,875
Wimpy.
[chuckles]

236
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,500
Here's my suggestion.

237
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,000
You fight
under wrestling rules.

238
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,541
Sumo for me.

239
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,958
I lose if I step
outside the circle,

240
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,833
or if anything
but my feet touches the ground.

241
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,208
You lose if you're on your back
any longer than one second.

242
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,875
But your hands and knees
are free to touch the mat.

243
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,083
Gasp! What's he thinking?

244
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,666
He's made a list of rules

245
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,250
that've given his competitor
the upper hand!

This guy.

247
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,750
All muscle, no brain.

248
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,541
And yet, this could work
to my advantage.

249
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,541
You're not doing this
'cause you underestimate me.

250
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,166
All right, then, but I still
have my own pride to consider.

251
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:23,875
There!

252
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,208
Now you have something to grab.

Huh, what?
You're asking me?

I don't know

If this were sumo,
you would have just died.

Let's equate losing with dying.

Well, not
in wrestling terms, anyway.

[CHIHIRO]
Far from it.

I've got a lot of fight
left in me.

The champion's unleashing
a flurry of brutal attacks!

298
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,458
But instead of toppling
his opponent,

299
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,958
he can't even
drop him to his knees!

300
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,625
[REINA] How can you be having
this much trouble, Kunisaki?

301
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,208
Incredible.

302
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,125
If you get knocked down
in our sport, you lose.

303
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,250
So that means...

304
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,958
there's nobody in martial arts

305
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,875
who's more impervious to falling
than a sumo wrestler!

306
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,958
We divide our attention between
standing and ground moves,

307

but they dedicate their entire
training to remaining upright.

Is this it?

The challenger has been on his
back foot the whole match.

And like that,
a barrage of attacks!

to the very end, huh?

323
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,208
He's underestimating me.

Something's changed about him.

[CHIHIRO] You're
a strong opponent, Hinomaru.

326
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,958
But you're obsessed with sumo

327
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,291
and refuse to stay
on the offensive.

328
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,833
And that'll be your downfall!

329

You're finished!

Impressive technique.

Right underhand throw.

Demon wheel!

00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,458
What we're competing for isn't
the survival of our bodies.

It's about spirit.

342
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,583
When you've spent
all your power, pride,

343
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,166
and resolve,
only for it to be useless

344
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,166
and you see your opponent
still standing in the ring,

345
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,375
that's a sumo wrestler's death.

346
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,333
I didn't expect you
to counter that.

This can't be happening.

That's kind of
a specific question.

Well I'm obviously going
to be needing one

Some kind of grudge?
