00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:11.136
[RYOMA]
Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil.

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.223
[RYOMA]
I'll trash this place!

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.600
And you folks can't stop me!

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:17.601
[JANE]
Oh, yeah?

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:21.730
[grunting]

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:23.398
No, I've been thwarted!

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:27.778
[RYOMA] You're probably
wondering why I'd be doing this.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.780
Best to take long
stories from the top.

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.076
[TAYLOR] I never dreamed
of using slimes in this way.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.460
I'm simply astonished
at how insightful

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.128
this visit turned out to be.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.673
Well, it's quite an honor
for the head of the local

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.800
Tamer's Guild to
stop by in person.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.802
So, really, the pleasure
was all mine.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.179
I hope you'll continue to
prove a creature's strength

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.516
is not the sole indicator when
it comes to a tamer's worth.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.518
Can't wait to see what
other uses for slimes

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.602
you think up.

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:01.937
[RYOMA]
Thanks, Mister Taylor!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.526
To live up to his expectations,
I need to start a new branch.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.987
[THUG A] What kinda racket
are you people running here?

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.962
How exactly do you intend
to make up for this, huh?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.047
You owe me!

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.512
Excuse me, sir, but is
there a problem here?

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.805
Stay outta this, kid.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.431
Run home to Mommy.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:06.353
'Fraid I have to insist as the
manager of this establishment.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.188
You're the one
who runs this joint?

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.109
Well, your laundry
service ruined my shirt!

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.236
Care to explain how
that happened?

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.571
Know who's paying for this?
Not me!

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:21.410
I'll better assist you
once I take a look.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.412
That tear seems like it
was made with a knife,

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.331
then forcefully ripped apart.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.999
I hate to say it,
but it's clear your story

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.209
doesn't track, sir.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:30.460
You made it up.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.379
Are you callin' me a liar?

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.089
You haven't said so
much as, "Sorry,"

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:35.882
and now you're blaming
the customer?

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.051
This business is plain terrible!

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.720
[RYOMA]
I'll prove we're not at fault.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.054
Come on out, guys.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.097
[THUG A]
Huh?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.183
Pardon, may I please
borrow somebody's laundry

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.685
to demonstrate?

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.691
Though, technically,
our slimes do eat grime

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.235
and gunk off clothes,
they don't have actual teeth.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.404
They don't have claws
either, for that matter.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:00.699
They're simply incapable
of tearing garments apart.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.993
So I'm positive our
service wasn't responsible

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.370
for damaging your
shirt, like you claim.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.289
It seems you're trying
to defraud our shop,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.750
and rest assured the authorities
are gonna hear every word!

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:13.628
[growls]
Now you're gonna pay!

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.885
[grunts]

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.971
[CROWD laughs]

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.186
I don't like this one bit.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.104
It's the second time in
just a matter of days

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.231
that someone's
fraudulently attacked us.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.692
Yet I can't grasp
what motive they have.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.570
[RYOMA] Probably to
tarnish our reputation.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.490
Yes, but who would
benefit from our failure?

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.493
Bamboo Forest is the only
laundry service in town,

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.662
therefore we have
no competitors.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.706
I'll have Callum
investigate this.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.542
Give him a day or two,
see what he can dig up.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.919
Yes, please do.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.552
[ASAGI]
Well, if it isn't Ryoma.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.970
[RYOMA]
Hello, Mister Asagi.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.722
Takin' a day off?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.225
I am. And what of you?

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.394
[RYOMA] Just got done at
the shop and headed home.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.938
Working hard is always key,

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.233
but so is allowing ourselves
a moment to breathe.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.360
[RYOMA]
That looks pretty new.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.487
Mm? Good eye.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.534
Much like us, my blades get
worn out after too much use.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.077
Can't stay sharp
with a dull sword,

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:30.163
so I replace mine once a year.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.083
Where'd you get that one,
if you don't mind me asking?

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.460
Well, are you asking
because you're looking for

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.712
an art piece to mount on a wall,

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.423
or are you perhaps in the
market for a new weapon?

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.175
[RYOMA]
The weapon option.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.010
There are a few shops
in the royal capital

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.137
that sell decent swords,
but if you're like me,

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.639
and replace them
when they begin to dull,

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.392
it could start getting
rather expensive.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.644
[RYOMA] Your katanas
are from the capital?

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.105
I am fortunate in that
my hometown sends me

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.482
a replacement blade
when I need one.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.026
I receive this kind of support
as a special exception

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.612
since I'm still in training.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.698
Wow, that's really nice!

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.825
[ASAGI] If you're specifically
seeking a katana,

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:09.494
I imagine an instructor
taught you how to wield one.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.079
That connection
will probably get you

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.664
the most affordable price.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.462
[RYOMA] My late grandfather
forged and fought with katanas.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.298
I learned from him.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.133
[RYOMA]
That'll be my cover story.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.509
Ah, apologies.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.053
Buying expensive blades may
be your only course of action

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.972
apart from using other weapons.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.850
Sorry I couldn't be
of more help to you.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:35.520
Actually, you were very helpful!

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:39.316
I wonder if I can forge
my own katanas.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:43.612
Modern ones are made
from Tamahagane steel.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.282
Getting ahold of charcoal
won't be the slightest issue.

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:50.785
As for the iron sand also
found in Tamahagane,

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.537
I can make my own using alchemy,

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.748
thanks to the resources
in these mines!

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.504
I have the knowledge to
create a sword, but that's it.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.381
I lack the skill to do it well.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.387
No point in making a weapon
I can't wield effectively.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.767
Item Box.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.353
Should be somewhere.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.188
Ah-ha!

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.982
I knew it'd be a good idea
to take that thug's spear.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.525
Shouldn't've messed with me!

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.823
It handles better than
I thought it would.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.910
Though I'd prefer a katana,
a spear will work for now.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.542
The real katana swordsmith
was my earthly dad.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.711
His lessons are the only
reason I have a clue

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.089
about forging them,
but he ultimately decided

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.967
I lacked any real talent
and gave up on me.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:53.223
He had me focus on learning
martial arts instead,

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.642
with an emphasis on
hand-to-hand combat.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.191
Still, he taught me how to use
most every weapon imaginable.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.943
That included spears.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.155
I think this thing is magical,
if I remember right.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.163
Whoa! Pretty cool!

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.915
But that blast was
at such a low level,

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.501
I might as well
cast my own magic.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.627
It's late.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.170
I should eat and head to bed.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.010
[CARLA] Here's what
our search turned up.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.512
A factional dispute?

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.431
Yes, that appears
to be the link.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.182
The current head of
Gimul's Tamer's Guild

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.892
is in a rather delicate bind.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.478
One of the factions wants
to ruin Mister Taylor's rep

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.857
just 'cause they don't see eye
to eye on the same values?

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.900
[CARLA] The majority of
tamers favor strength,

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.694
but Mister Taylor believes
it's more important

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.989
to wisely coexist with monsters.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.741
So, to make him
even less popular,

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.701
they're spreading
rumors to defame him.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:55.577
Right.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.496
Recently, they've accused him
of coddling a useless rookie.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.415
One who can only
capture weak slimes.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.126
I guess this "useless
rookie" would be me.

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.878
Which brings us to the attacks,

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.047
or the laughable attempts
to sully the good name

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.091
of a business Mister Taylor's
recently championed.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.885
[RYOMA]
Hmm.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.054
How 'bout we get a
new rumor going, then?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.972
But instead of lying,
we'll actually tell everybody

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.223
the truth.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.142
I could see that plan
going off without a hitch

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.643
if we use the Merchant's Guild,

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.228
since many members
have an ear for that sort

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.271
of thing.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.647
Though I specialize in slimes,

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.525
I did tame six limour birds
at the grell frog outbreak.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.277
Not many folks know that!

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.029
And once that story
starts to get around,

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.281
it'll make Mister Taylor
look good by proving he has

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.699
an eye for talent, yeah?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.034
Yes, that could work!

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.203
Most everyone knows
how difficult it is to tame

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.370
limour birds.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.206
That alone should
cast plenty of doubt

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.083
on the people
speaking ill of you.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.501
Let's spread some rumors!

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:46.920
[GROUP]
Nice work, everyone.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:57.806
Wow, pretty slick.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.057
You've got a slimy gift.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.016
[MARIA giggles]

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.768
[RYOMA]
Another job well done.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.312
Why don't we go ahead
and wrap up for the day?

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.355
Sure.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:09.150
If it's okay, I'd like to
stay a little bit longer

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.985
so I can learn more about
the differences between

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.862
each slime.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.280
Yeah! Same here!

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.991
[RYOMA] Okay, but don't
push yourselves too hard.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.494
Learning our employees
capabilities is just another

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.204
part of the job for managers.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.123
And I for one,
find the method that you use

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.458
to profit off of your slimes
far more entertaining

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.501
than bothersome!

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.711
[ALL]
Mm-hmm.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.172
[RYOMA] Mister Caulkin,
Mister Tony, and Miss Lobelia

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:32.465
were introduced to me
through my friend

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.300
and fellow adventurer,
Mister Jeff.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.219
All three are tamers,
slime researches,

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.972
and future Bamboo
Forest managers.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.141
And remember,
don't hesitate to tell me

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.767
any issues you may have.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.644
I want you to enjoy it here.

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.020
And believe me, we do!

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:49.107
The laboratory was nothing but
despair and disappointment.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.401
This is heaven in comparison!

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:52.610
Woof, "despair"?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.362
It was really that bad?

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.614
You have no idea how
awful working at a slime

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.199
research lab is.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.826
[LOBELIA] You only get sent
to one if you've fallen

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.369
out of favor,
and once you're there,

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.038
you're treated like
a worthless pest.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.291
[TONY] Our pay was
cut for the pettiest things

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.294
and we were told to
quit if we didn't like it.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:12.505
[RYOMA] Another instance
of an exploitative workplace.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.091
What was one of reasons
they'd cut your pay?

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.343
Not being able to produce
results in our research

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.970
was the most common excuse.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.681
Try explaining what we do
to the higher-ups, though!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.892
Slime study is a gradual
process that doesn't happen

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.102
overnight, but do they care?

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.937
[LOBELIA] There are so
many different types,

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.939
yet so little is known
about their species

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.065
as a whole.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.651
How could we hope to
learn how they evolve?

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.236
Huh?

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:38.615
It seems like their evolution
process is totally random.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.825
We'd run tests,
but where to start?

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.120
No tests meant no results,
and no results meant no respect.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.455
And that meant no job.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:48.124
Sadly, it's not all that
unusual for folks like us

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.959
to go from slimes to slums.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.794
[ALL sigh]

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.796
[RYOMA]
Um...

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.549
What all did you feed the
slimes that you studied?

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.552
Scraps left over from what
we fed the other animals.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.471
They aren't picky. They eat
whatever you put in front

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:02.639
of them.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.556
[RYOMA sighs]

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:04.432
What's wrong?

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.392
Did you get a headache
all of a sudden?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.354
Secondhand frustration
'cause the factor that affects

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:13.733
how slimes evolve, um,
it's the things they eat.

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.695
So the reason you guys
kept getting mixed results

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.614
is because they had
such a mixed diet.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.157
Wait, are you positive?

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.784
The prevailing theory for
years has been that food

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.744
and evolution aren't related.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.288
[RYOMA] I spent three years
studying my own theory,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.998
so I'm pretty certain I'm right.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.752
Had I been aware of that fact,
I could've continued

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.880
my research!
But now all I have is regret!

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.383
Hey, we're going to
continue your research here!

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.759
Cheer up, Mister Caulkin!

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.761
Right, dry your eyes and
let's prove to the world

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.137
how useful slimes can be!

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.348
[CAULKIN crying]

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.559
Yeah. There's no
time for self-pity!

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.769
[LOBELIA]
Manager!

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.021
Please feel free to teach us
anything and everything else

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.315
you know about
slimes that we don't!

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.234
If you any have insight
on taming big slimes,

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.819
I'm all ears!

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.446
I figured it was
impossible, but is it?

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.699
[RYOMA] It's possible, but I
don't wanna deal another blow

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.117
to their pride.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.744
Let's start with smaller slimes
and then work our way up.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.289
Yes! Our minds are
yours for the molding!

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.749
[RYOMA]
This might take a minute.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.294
But I gotta admire how
passionate they are.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.045
That's a great sign, in my eyes.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.966
[CAULKIN]
What should we feed them?

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.467
[LOBELIA]
How about barbecue?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.719
[TONY]
Or fried chicken!

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.890
[MARIA] Why are you all
standing back there?

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.642
It makes me look gigantic!

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.316
[RYOMA]
I lost track of the time.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:38.651
Two, no, three of them.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.620
[ATTACKER A]
He's over here!

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.922
[RYOMA] How do they
know where I'm going?

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:00.965
Teleport!

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.176
Where'd that runt go?

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.308
[ATTACKER A]
Did we lose him?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.351
Focus.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.478
He's up there!

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.105
[ATTACKER A grunts]

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.565
[ATTACKER C grunts]

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.442
You damn brat!

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.693
[RYOMA]
Teleport.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.323
You won't be able to move
at all for a good while.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.408
Wait, did you poison
these things?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.495
[RYOMA] The real question is,
why were you chasing me?

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:34.082
Kid, all you need to know
is you're gonna be sorry!

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.125
I'll forgive you if the price
is right and you give up

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.794
your limour birds, though!

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:40.296
Hot! Ah! That thing
is really hot!

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:43.591
That's a pretty cocky attitude
for someone in your position.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.186
[ATTACKER B gasps]

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.313
[RYOMA]
I eventually noticed your trick.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.399
You were using your
tamed monster to follow

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.025
my every move.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.444
Then I realized I could
use my monsters as well.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.075
[WORGAN]
This way!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.576
[RYOMA]
Guild Master?

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.453
What are you doing here?

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.038
[WORGAN]
Ah, you know.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.832
Figured that limour bird
was leading these guys

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.750
to some action.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.544
[RYOMA]
You figured right!

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.837
I had him call for the guards,

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.297
but thanks for taking
the initiative, too!

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.050
[WORGAN] Sure, but listen, do
you have some time tomorrow?

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.222
[RYOMA] That's everything
that went down last night.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.682
I'm not trying to scare you,

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.851
I just want you all to be
aware since there's a chance

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.687
you could be attacked next.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.648
Try to finish your work
before the sun goes down.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.650
Mister Fei and Miss Li Ling?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.696
We might need you two
to take on more guard duty.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.990
I also intend to address
this alarming matter

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.908
with the guild masters
when I meet up with them

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.161
later today.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:56.080
I'll be in attendance
for that meeting as well.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.373
[RYOMA]
That's all from me.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.167
Thanks for your time, everyone!

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.252
Of course.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.337
[WORGAN]
No beating around the bush.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.548
Ryoma, I'm gonna need
you to buckle down

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.383
and play a little defense.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:10.052
Okay. But what do
you mean by that?

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.430
The rumor mill has
been quite active lately.

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.765
We took it upon ourselves
to investigate.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.310
And we can say with absolute
confidence someone sent

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.895
those thugs after you.

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.897
Just put your energy
into protecting yourself

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.899
and your shop and
leave the mastermind

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.775
behind this to us.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.027
[RYOMA]
Fair enough.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:29.780
That said, the shop needs
to be perfectly secure.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.365
[WORGAN]
It will be.

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.367
Jeff recommended a
trustworthy fella to help

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.244
with that, actually.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.039
What about a bodyguard
for you personally?

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.458
I can handle myself just fine.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.669
[GLISSELA] You know, if you're
a skilled enough fighter,

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.755
there's a nifty trick that
makes people think twice

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.089
about attacking you.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.257
Like what?

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.552
[PUNK A]
Run! We don't stand a chance!

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.595
[yells]

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.186
[PUNK B] Hey, wait,
I surrender! I surrender!

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.188
Look, I really am sorry.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.065
I hope you understand that.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:11.155
[RYOMA] Been a while since
I had to take out so many.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:14.450
Oh. Hey, great timing, guys!

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.118
[GUARD A]
These the crooks of the day?

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.163
Yeah, sorry to cause trouble.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.498
Dimension Home.

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.588
It's a thousand sute
for one High Heal.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.216
Since I used 72 heals,
that a grand total

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:33.302
of 72,000 sute.

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:34.804
But I'll cut you a deal!

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.305
70,000 will do!

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.937
That is quite a price tag.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.772
It's like a new type
of self-defense.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.691
Bet it'll keep low-lives
away once everyone

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.943
and their grandma hears
that whoever attacks him

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.195
gets beat to a pulp
and charged for healing.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:54.532
[RYOMA] I put Master Glissela's
idea into practice.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:57.577
Though I hesitated at first
on account of how harsh it is.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.205
[GUARD A] Here's today's
fee, paid in full.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.207
[RYOMA]
Thanks. I appreciate it.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.584
We appreciate you.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.252
It'll take a while,
but these thugs will work

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:07.920
to pay back every last bit.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.381
And believe it or not,
a lot of them get rehabilitated

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.717
through the labor, or at least
pick up legitimate skills

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.677
for when their sentence is over.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.305
That makes me feel
a little bit better about it.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:22.476
All right, let the
training session begin!

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.312
I am a thuggish adventurer!

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.355
And I came to cause problems!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.317
Mister Dolce!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.615
Oh, no! I'm scared!

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:40.661
[GROUP grunting]

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:42.163
Okay, I think we're good!

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.873
Training session complete!

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.000
How did that go, Mister Dolce?

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.461
It was easy to respond
in a timely manner.

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:49.837
I greatly approve.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.088
[RYOMA]
Then I approve, too!

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.840
We got ourselves a plan!

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.717
[GROUP cheers]

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.218
[RYOMA]
Mister Dolce is a bodyguard,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.678
and yet another newcomer,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.639
introduced to us
through Mister Jeff.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.726
He's observably antisocial,
but very earnest and reliable.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.686
[SELMA] That exercise
work up an appetite?

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:14.362
[RYOMA] Hmm? This bread
feels a bit fluffier than usual.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.781
We used the natural yeast
that you taught us about.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:20.451
It's nice to know that you
could tell the difference.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.912
These sausages
are delicious, too!

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.206
[SELMA] The nearby
butcher gave us those.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.333
He said it was a gift to
celebrate the Manager's

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.168
taming of the limour birds.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.754
[RYOMA] The new rumors are
spreading like wildfire.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.756
Excellent work, Mister Callum.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.509
[MARIA] Good food tastes
even better in good company.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.594
'Specially when
Miss Selma makes it!

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:42.139
[SELMA] I wonder if the charcoal
the manger gave me helped.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.891
This is great.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.559
Everything's quite delicious.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.020
My word! That's the first
comment about my cooking

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:50.439
Mister Dolce's ever made!

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.608
[RYOMA] This security training
brought us an unexpected

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.444
yet very welcome benefit, Elia.

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:58.322
The employees are communicating
with each other more.

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:00.116
If this keeps up,
I should be able to open

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.409
a new branch soon.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.162
[CARLA]
Manager?

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.122
What's up?

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.582
If you have a moment to spare,
could we look these over?

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.294
Something about the balance?

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:15.214
[CARLA] Just that our sales
are growing at a steady pace.

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.590
Yeah, no kidding!

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.051
I don't simply want
to talk numbers with you.

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.553
Did you know the
prospective managers

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:23.097
have the basics of
bookkeeping mastered?

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.890
Or that Miss Maria
learned the fundamentals

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.225
of taming magic?

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:29.103
All thanks to Miss Lobelia's
guidance, of course.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.689
[RYOMA] Every single person
I've employed is working harder

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.274
than I anticipated.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.776
I'm surrounded by people
who expect great things

00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:37.945
from me, and those
high hopes are leading

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.072
to these high numbers.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.866
Looks like the signs
are saying "yes."

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.784
Let's open a second branch.

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.453
I'm with you all the way, sir.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:46.954
[knocking]

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.080
[RYOMA]
Miss Glissela?

00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.918
[GLISSELA] I had a feeling I'd
be seeing your bright eyes

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.336
in my doorway.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.255
Rumor has it that
you're no longer at risk

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.048
of being randomly attacked.

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.930
Came to figure out
the best place to put

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.474
your second branch, right?

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.184
You read me like an open book!

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.853
[BIRD chirps]

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.188
[RYOMA]
It's from Elia!

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:19.737
[ELIARIA] Dear Mister Ryoma,
I'm sure you're hard at work

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.947
building your shop's
spotless reputation

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.825
and studying your slimes.

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.328
I'm studying quite a
bit myself, these days,

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:29.413
to prepare for school
in the royal capital.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.710
In addition to academics,
I'm also brushing up

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:35.836
on my magic.

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:41.550
Whenever my training
wears on me,

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.594
I take a break by playing
with the Bubbly Water

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.555
magic you taught me.

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:48.182
I hope you're remembering
to take breaks

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.725
every now and then, too.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.147
[RYOMA] Actually, it might
be a minute before I can

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:57.149
take my next break, Elia.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.035
Wish me luck, everyone.

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:09.995
Good luck and safe travels!

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.045
[RYOMA]
Here I go.

00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:21.006
Off to a new town
to build my next shop!
