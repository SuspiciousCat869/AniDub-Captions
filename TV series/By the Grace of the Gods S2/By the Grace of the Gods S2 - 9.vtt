WEBVTT

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230
[TEACHER A] All right,
class is now in session.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.148
Last time, as you'll recall,
we learned all about

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.650
the basics of magic.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.944
Were you able to feel the
power inside of your body?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.571
That wondrous
energy you possess?

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.281
If the answer is no,
today you'll be doing

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.535
the same training we did
in our previous session.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.787
If the answer is yes, you'll
move onto the next step,

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.998
which is controlling your magic
and expelling it outwards.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.837
[ELIARIA sighs] It's only been
one month since I arrived

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.967
at the academy, and the boredom
is already unbearable.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.303
Every lesson has been
on fundamentals

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.597
that I learned before
coming here.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.976
And, of course, no one
wants to associate with me

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.728
because I'm the Duke's daughter.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.273
My title and magic
power intimidate them.

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.700
[MICHELLE] Is something
the matter, young lady?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.304
I know you.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.348
Count Wildan's daughter, right?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.724
You have a keen eye.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.185
I'm Michelle Wildan,
just as you surmised.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.812
The Count's eldest daughter.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.856
Didn't realize that I was
addressing Lady Jamil.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.693
If only my eyes were half
as keen as yours are.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.528
Please pardon my rudeness.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.071
You've done nothing rude.

00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:18.156
Our status and titles don't
matter while we're on

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.867
the school grounds,
so if it's all right,

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.703
may I please call
you Miss Michelle?

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.330
Yes, my lady. I'd like that.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.124
Still a tad too formal.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.001
How about you call
me Elia from now on.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.294
[MICHELLE chuckles]
All right,

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.171
I could adjust
to calling you Elia.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.383
May we speak a little
more casually in general?

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:37.718
Etiquette's taxing.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.802
But of course.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.179
I much prefer speaking
more naturally.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.349
Then back to what
I asked before,

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.977
are you out here because
something's the matter?

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.938
Not really, at least in terms
of facing an actual issue,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.981
I guess.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.151
It's just, classes I'm
taking are very tedious.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.362
[MICHELLE] Ahh, I know
that feeling all too well.

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.489
I basically pretend to pay
attention during our lessons

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.408
at this point.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.411
I also try to avoid getting
involved with silly cliques,

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:07.956
so I have hardly anyone to
talk with between classes.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:10.208
Oh, wow. That's surprising.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.918
I'd have thought you were
one of the academy's

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.545
more popular students.

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:14.921
[MICHELLE laughs]

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.257
Maybe when I
first enrolled here.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.634
Some girls got the wrong
idea because of the uniform

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.803
I prefer wearing.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.222
Anyway, most lost interest
when they realized

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.599
I'm not that social.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.309
[ELIARIA] So you spend your
breaks here where you can

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.435
be alone?

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.228
[MICHELLE]
Sometimes.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.939
Today, I'm doing an experiment.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.818
Since it involves magic circles,
you must be an alchemist.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.030
I wish I could be good at
something as cool as alchemy,

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:43.241
but I'm studying a subject
called "magic circle science."

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.994
I've never heard of that.
Can you explain it?

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.370
[MICHELLE]
It's a minor field of study

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.789
that branched off from alchemy,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.875
which researches why magic
circles react the way they do.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.919
And, as luck would have it,
the only instructor

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.588
who taught it at this
academy quit last year.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.216
So I study it on
my own time now.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.634
[ELIARIA]
You must like it.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.885
[MICHELLE]
Yes.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.346
I have to say though, I was
impressed you even knew

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.515
what a magic circle
was to begin with.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.432
[ELIARIA]
Why?

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:08.683
Most people don't.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.519
The misconceptions
they have stop them from

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.771
giving alchemy a chance.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.106
But you don't seem to share
that narrow point of view.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.152
[ELIARIA]
Guess that's true.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.112
[MICHELLE] I don't find
alchemy distasteful either,

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.448
so could you teach me
what you know?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.576
[ELIARIA] Sorry for misleading
you, but I'm not an alchemist.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.286
I am good friends
with one, though,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.580
so I know not every
alchemist uses their craft

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.040
for scamming people.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.875
That's right. They don't.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.169
Now, back to my
little experiment.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.589
Would it bother you
if I stuck around?

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.966
[MICHELLE]
Not at all.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.592
[ELIARIA]
What's inside that bottle?

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:46.179
[MICHELLE] Ink with crushed
non-elemental and fire crystals.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.974
It's the special mixture I have
to use to draw my circles.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.268
Adding magic crystals to
the ink does something?

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.311
Depending on the
type of crystal used.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.564
Mine can start a
fire, for instance.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.732
The ratio of the magic
crystals and the design

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:01.069
of the circle are what determine
the strength of that fire,

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.738
as well as how efficiently
it can be controlled.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.532
Very interesting.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:08.285
Why are you doing all
of this research, though?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.287
Because of what you just said.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.039
Everything about this
subject is so interesting

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.624
and there's more to
discover when a field

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.334
lacks research, right?

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.753
[ELIARIA] Something tells me
Miss Michelle and Mister Ryoma

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.463
would get along famously.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.925
[MICHELLE] I'm not sure
what kind of reaction

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.219
this will generate,
so stand back.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.762
Right. Good idea.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:36.897
All right, here goes.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.106
It's showtime.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.863
I didn't realize someone
else was around.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.740
I'm sorry for alarming you.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.450
Why'd you apologize?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.620
I'm the one who just randomly
waltzed in and interfered.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.413
There was zero interference.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.498
You're Miss Miyabi, are you not?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.708
From our class?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.585
[ELIARIA] You're new to
this school too, right?

00:06:58.627 --> 00:06:59.753
[MIYABI]
That's right.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.463
I was just trying to catch
the duke's daughter

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.840
by herself because
I have a message.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.550
You have a message for me?

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.218
Who is it from?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.597
Well, thing is, that's why
I'm trying to be discreet.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.642
Someone could overhear and start
rumors since it's from a boy.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.185
Miss Michelle won't tell.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.520
So, please, speak freely.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.106
In that case,
I ran into somebody.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.942
A young tamer named Ryoma.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.443
Mister Ryoma?

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.029
Then are you from Gimul,
or did you meet somewhere else?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.448
[MIYABI] We met in Lenaf
through my father.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.867
And when he learned that
I'd be going to this school,

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.661
he asked me to keep
an eye out for somebody

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.871
he knew, a girl named Eliaria.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.581
[ELIARIA]
Ah, I see.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.167
So, then, what message
did he send?

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.752
[MIYABI]
"Good luck."

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.545
That was about the extent of it.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.130
I think he just wanted
me to check on you

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.548
'cause he was worried.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.845
[ELIARIA] Going doesn't bother
me so much but knowing

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.973
I won't have any friends does.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.308
Because you see,
if my family's status

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.352
doesn't scare them off,
my magical power

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.437
is usually the cause.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.023
He could've said
"good luck" in a letter.

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:05.443
This was a setup for
the two of us to meet.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.320
Thank you, Miss Miyabi.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.323
Message received loud and clear.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.367
And here's a thought,
since we have a mutual friend

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.577
in Mister Ryoma,
why don't we take this

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.205
opportunity to become
friends as well?

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.581
You wanna be my friend?

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.917
But I'm just an ordinary
commoner, though.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.627
[ELIARIA] Status has nothing
to do with friendships

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.587
in my book.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.631
Besides, it would be
sad to spend my days

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.675
at the academy
without a single friend.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.596
Luckily, you won't have to!

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:34.848
[ELIARIA laughs]

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.433
[MICHELLE] If there's room
for three in this group,

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.268
I'd like to join.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.437
The more the merrier, I say!

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.106
Hey, you know what we could do?

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.692
Turn our group into a
practical training team.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.195
[ELIARIA] I've been concerned
about forming a team

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.780
for quite some time.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:51.990
[MIYABI]
Me, too.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.576
Which is why I
haven't joined any yet.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.245
[MICHELLE] The existing teams
are mostly based on status.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.081
All nobles or all commoners.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.958
And not a single
one appealed to me,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.418
regardless of who was in them.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.753
Glad we found each other.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.713
Now we won't be obligated
to join up with people

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.339
we might not get along with.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.133
That would've been a nightmare.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.634
Yeah.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.636
I was holding out because
I wanted to find folks

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.264
I like being around,
and here we are.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.974
Whether it was luck or fate,

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.518
I'm just happy that it
brought us all together.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.062
This should be a fun group!

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.313
Yeah, for real!

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:24.773
Great. It's settled.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:25.815
Indeed.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.777
But teams are supposed to
have five or six people, right?

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.904
[ELIARIA] So, it's still
possible we might get members

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.989
we're incompatible with.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.949
[MIYABI] I wonder if we
can find another student

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.035
who doesn't care about the
status of their teammates,

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.787
like you two.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.997
[MICHELLE] Actually,
I can think of someone.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.376
Riela Clifford.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.796
She is the eldest daughter
of Baron Clifford.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.922
Cliffords, huh?

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.549
I'm pretty sure they started
out as a family of knights,

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.384
then gained the status
of nobles thanks to their

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.512
accomplishments, I think.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.889
Uh-huh. She can be a
stickler for the rules

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.100
and is very proud of herself.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.269
But she doesn't turn her nose up
to others based on status,

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.897
and gladly acknowledges
talent when she sees it.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.108
[ELIARIA]
She sounds perfect for our team!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.110
Um, it's fair to
say that I yield.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:11.486
[CROWD gasps]

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.367
[MICHELLE]
Riela.

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.493
[RIELA]
Hey, Michelle.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.579
Who are your friends?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.747
I'm glad you asked.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:23.790
We should talk.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.505
[RIELA]
All right. I'll join your team.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.966
In fact, I feel absolutely
honored you even asked.

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.136
Happy to have you aboard!

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.345
Relieved, too.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.097
Are you really sure, though?

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.765
This isn't your only option.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.392
You have the best grades
in swordsmanship

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.768
out of our class.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.436
I know without a doubt
lots of other people

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.438
want you on their team.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.816
I did receive an invite or two.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.152
But I refuse to team up
with those who confuse

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.071
the dignity of nobility
with arrogant vanity.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.657
Oh, I do too!
Definitely a great fit!

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.659
It's nice to meet you!

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.035
The pleasure's mine.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.288
We're only one person
away from a full practical

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.664
training team now.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.207
Do any of you have
somebody in mind

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.418
for our fifth candidate?

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.588
Yeah, but I'm not sure
she's worth suggesting.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.047
We have to think smart,

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.883
and when it comes
to combat training,

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.927
Riela is the only one among
us who can fight close range.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:20.722
True. If we want a balanced
team, it'd be great

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:22.849
to have one more
close-ranged ally.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.601
Which isn't my
candidate's strength.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.270
She's best as a scout or a spy,
so things like stealth

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.189
and setting traps
are her specialties.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.566
No fighting skills.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.610
Speaking of, there she is now!

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.405
Sitting alone?

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.657
[MIYABI] Yep. Name's Kanan.
She's a commoner.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.701
And while she doesn't
have a title to flaunt,

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.037
her nimble fingers
are worth mentioning.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.622
Wants to be a
professional artisan.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.626
Well, teammates?
Any thoughts?

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.211
I'll have no complaints
so long as she has

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.754
a good personality.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.964
I agree with Miss
Riela's sentiments.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.716
[MIYABI]
Then I'll go see what she says!

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.220
I can't believe I
got rejected again.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.347
[MIYABI] Hey, Kanan.
Got a minute to talk?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.392
Wait, I know you.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.894
Miss Miyabi, right?

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.896
What could you possibly
wanna talk about?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:10.897
Team stuff!

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.691
Practical training team
stuff, to be more exact!

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.610
You see, we really don't
want our fifth member

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:16.861
to be random, so...

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.154
You're asking me?

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.530
Yeah. That's right.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.449
So if you're game, could
you spare a quick minute

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.534
to discuss it with
the other members?

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.536
[KANAN]
Yes! I have nothing but minutes!

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:29.082
Hi, my name's Kanan Schuzer
and it is very nice to meet you!

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:30.458
[GROUP] It's very nice
to meet you, as well.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.626
[ELIARIA]
Miss Kanan.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.753
A Schuzer who's good
at making crafts.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.380
That makes sense.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.339
That's right.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.299
My family is the Schuzer family.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.510
The one famous for
creating magic items,

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.096
but I'm in no way
trying to brag.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.223
As far as magic item
crafting is concerned,

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.683
I'm a failure.

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.351
So please don't expect
anything from me

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.019
in that department.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.521
[MIYABI]
Why do you say that?

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.898
[KANAN] Well, I specialize
in enchanting magic,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.193
but I'm a lil too
specialized, ya know?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.945
Well, yes, that does make sense.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.029
Huh?

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.490
I'm still confused, do you
mind spelling it out for me?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.741
[KANAN]
Sure.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.744
Long ago, enchanting magic
was created by a person

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.372
who had certain characteristics
and the only ones

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:11.791
capable of wielding it are
said to be descendants

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.126
from that bloodline.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.085
That's it.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.462
The bloodline spread
and changed over time,

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.256
but every once in a
while, someone is born

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:22.010
with the exact traits that
made the creator so unique.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.511
And that someone is you?

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.971
[KANAN]
Yes.

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.598
If you're wondering
why this is a dilemma,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.143
it's because enchanting
magic is the only kind

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.812
I'll ever be capable of using.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.732
I'm a Schuzer who can't make
magic items on my own.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:37.734
Let's see.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.861
In order to create a magic item,

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.612
you need enchanting
magic and a spell

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.656
from another class of magic.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.491
Which means you'll always
need someone else

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.160
there to hold your hand.

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:48.244
Yuh-huh.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.371
Which means, being
compatible with others

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.081
is like a must
for you, isn't it?

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.958
[KANAN]
Oh, it one hundred percent is!

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.127
I'm a total people-person,
and thought I'd rub elbows

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.671
with tons of potential
partners at the academy!

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.798
Until I actually
got here, that is.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.008
[pouts]

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.760
Everybody brushes me off.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:06.220
I've learned not to even
talk to most nobles.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.931
No one listens, so no
one will work with me.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.683
I'm sorry I asked.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.101
I wasn't trying to pry.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.353
Just curious.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.313
Thanks for trusting us with
something you consider

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.981
to be so secret.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.149
Well, of course!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.818
You four wanna decide whether
or not this'll even work.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.364
If I joined without coming
clean, I'd just be tricking you.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.866
Personally, I really appreciate
that kind of honesty.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.242
I say yes!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.827
Great, that makes two of us.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.871
I think Miss Kanan will make
a wonderful addition

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.122
to our group.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.083
I do believe that's unanimous.

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:36.167
No.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.753
You four have to be pulling
my leg or something.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.671
I can't use offensive magic
and I'm a complete

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.507
novice with swords.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.592
We all have our strengths
and weaknesses.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.136
And my strength is fighting,
so I can protect you.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.554
Then it's a done deal.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.641
Kanan is now our team's
fifth and final member.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.268
Or maybe it's a real done deal
when she actually agrees.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.478
So, whaddaya say?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.146
I say I'm absolutely in!

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.981
Like, I almost can't believe it!

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.818
I was turned down by so many
teams till you came along!

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.278
You have no clue how
lost I was feeling!

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.781
Thank you so much
for accepting me!

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.116
[RIELA]
Thanks for joining.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.450
[MICHELLE]
That makes five.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.494
[ELIARIA]
Feels like a good little group.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:14.122
[MIYABI]
This is gonna be fun.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.499
[STUDENT A]
Those two teamed up with nobles?

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:19.127
[STUDENT B] A charity act
that's bound to fail.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.003
You'd think they'd
at least whisper.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.339
Well, we expected
as much, didn't we?

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.257
It's asinine.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:27.260
I honestly can't be mad if
people find this suprising.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.177
I did, too.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.805
I'm with three nobles, one of
which is the duke's daughter!

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.348
Thought I was gonna
die from shock!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.474
[ELIARIA laughs]

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.809
[MIYABI laughs]

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.394
Hey, just wondering,

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.813
do any of you know
how to set up a camp?

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.440
Can't really say that I do.

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:41.941
I'm clueless as well.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.235
I've done it before,
so we'll be okay.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.111
Me, too.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.071
Those family camping
trips can pay off now.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.282
Then we have two
people with experience.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.033
Makes me feel a lot better.

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.286
Plus, the rest of us
are willing to learn.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.829
All right. Oh.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.456
Here comes the teacher now.

00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:58.958
Thank you for being
on time, everybody!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.585
Are you excited?

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.961
Because the
two-night camping...

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.796
[ELIARIA]
Our first training session,

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.381
and we'll complete it together.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.385
[KANAN] Please say "enchanter
magician" five times fast.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.303
Ready?

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:11.637
[ELIARIA]
We will be after the break!

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.933
[GROUP] "Enchanter magician,

[TEACHER A] You aren't
forbidden from interacting with

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:22.565
other teams,

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.442
but we do ask that each
group be responsible

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.903
for their own work.
Understood?

00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:28.613
[STUDENTS]
Right!

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.699
Twelve is just such a pivotal
age, wouldn't you agree?

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.784
Especially when you're a noble.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:37.371
They've had servants wait on
them hand and foot till now.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:40.249
This trip will challenge them
in ways they never dreamed.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.542
Let's help 'em through.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:42.668
Right.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.921
This isn't how you pitch a tent.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.465
Then ask someone who's done
it before, 'cause I haven't.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.050
[NOBLE STUDENT A]
Well, neither have I.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.262
Man. No dice, huh?

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.389
But there has to be a toilet!

00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:57.141
There isn't a bathtub either.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.559
What?

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.061
[RIELA]
Good, now pull!

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.270
[GROUP]
Right!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.566
[MIYABI]
Should I get more?

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.027
[MICHELLE]
Nah. Think this'll be enough.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.071
Ready? 'Cause here it goes!

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:14.867
[STUDENT C] I'm glad we
practiced beforehand.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.662
[STUDENT D] We've come a
long way from our first attempt.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.955
[NOBLE STUDENT A]
Hey.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.499
You clearly have time,
so pitch our tent, too.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.500
Why?

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.794
The teacher told us that we had
to take care of our own team's

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.713
needs, and last I checked,
we aren't teammates.

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.924
But we can't do it
and you two can.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.885
Well, then come better prepared
for the next training session.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.262
What did you just say?

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:35.346
You heard her!

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.306
[GIRLS growl]

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.020
[MIYABI] I didn't think it
would all go smoothly,

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.565
but good gracious.

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.359
[KANAN] There were quite
a few scuffles, huh?

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.486
[MICHELLE]
I'm worried about tomorrow.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.363
Just forget about them.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.532
Yes, that's a lot of
not our problem.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.367
We have to wake up early.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.494
[MIYABI]
Fair point. Good night.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.413
[KANAN]
Sleep tight, girls!

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.747

See you in the morning.

[NOBLE STUDENT A yelps]

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.381
What happened to her?

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.175
Their tent collapsed all of
a sudden, and she got hurt.

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:14.385
Badly?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.179
It's just a scratch that'll
probably leave a bruise.

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.347
She's okay.

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:19.765
Whew. Scared me.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.353
That hurts!

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.356
We told you to build our tent,
so it's really your fault!

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.358
Her blood is on
your stuck-up hands!

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.027
You aren't gonna take
any responsibility

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.862
for putting up your
tent the wrong way?

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.697
Don't blame us
for your mistakes!

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.741
Ugh! Shut your peasant mouth.

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.869
Let's all take a breath!

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.830
Magic shouldn't be used
to settle petty disputes!

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:43.998
[NOBLE STUDENT B]
But!

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.750
[MICHELLE]
Let's get that tent fixed up.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.293
Guide us through it, Riela.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.461
[RIELA]
Very well.

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.129
[ELIARIA]
I'll tend to her wounded leg.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.341
[NOBLE STUDENT A]
A slime?

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:56.177
As you can see, it isn't your
ordinary slime, though.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.804
It's a very special one that
has healing properties.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.723
A precious treasure
from a dear friend.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.808
Oh.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.810
Thank you so much
for helping us out.

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.896
[NOBLE STUDENT B]
Sorry for the way we acted.

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:08.439
That was a nice apology.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.232
You just gave it
to the wrong people.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:17.031
Sorry we blamed you.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.741
We were acting like jerks.

A good start to a beautiful day.

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:30.419
So, let's keep it going.

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:32.380
That brilliant energy
and teamwork.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.632
I think cooperation is
the secret to success

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.634
for this exercise.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.636
Let's stop bickering
amongst ourselves

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.221
and help each other out.

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:41.347
Seriously!

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.933
Yeah. Well said, Elia.

Great! We'll start now!

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:57.488
Rejoice, and consider
the toilet issue solved.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.698
[STUDENT B]
Yay!

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.492
[ELIARIA]
Miss Miyabi was right.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.785
You are good with traps!

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.413
She was also right about how
nimble your fingers are!

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:08.082
I'd never built a trap like
this one before today.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.000
Did ya come up with
this design yourself?

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.377
Not at all.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.921
I learned about these
from a very clever friend.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.051
Nicely done.
Those mushrooms are edible.

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:24.932
So good!

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:36.610
I'll help you carry it, okay?

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.738
'Kay. That's sweet of you.

[TEACHER A]
They grew up so much so fast.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.125
Amazing.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.335
I think most kids are
pretty eager to learn,

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:56.255
and a ray of sunshine is
always good for growth.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.674
Eliaria Jamil's team
did an excellent job

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:00.801
of providing that
sunshine for everyone.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:08.017
[MIYABI] Wish we weren't
leaving tomorrow. Too soon.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.936
[KANAN] This trip had me all
kinds of anxious but hanging out

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:13.522
with the whole class wound
up being really awesome!

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.399
Go figure, huh?

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.152
I used to be the opposite
of a social butterfly,

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.945
but now I can make
an effort to come out

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.197
of my cocoon a little more.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.531
Yeah.

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:24.492
Since we're all here
together, we might as well

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.660
be making some new friends.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.245
Making friends.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.872
[RYOMA] You're one of
those dear friends,

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.290
which is why I hope
you'll make your own

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:33.876
party-sized group of
schoolmates at the academy.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.003
I know you're worried,
but you've got this!

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.630
Trust me.

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:40.174
[STUDENT A]
Um... 'Scuse me, Miss Eliaria.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.844
These are yours.

[ELIARIA]
What a pretty bouquet!

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:46.764
You picked them for me?

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.641
Yes. That's right.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:51.101
Uh, because you helped
me carry that bucket!

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.812

[ELIARIA chuckles]

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:03.072
[ELIARIA]
Guess what, Mister Ryoma!

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:07.243
I actually managed to make some
friends among my schoolmates!

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.745
That's great, Elia.
It really is.

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:11.413
[ELIARIA] The flowers I got
from one of those friends

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.624
had berries mixed in with them.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.501
The healing and scavenger
slimes you gave me

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.711
think they're delicious.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.588
I hope your slimes
enjoy them, too!
