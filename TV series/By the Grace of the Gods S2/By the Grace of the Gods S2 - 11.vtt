Indeed.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.997
As Miss Jane stated, deciding
on food was the simple part.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.750
There's Gilmar cuisine,
a few semi-sah pastries,

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.127
and some dishes
with dante seeds.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.464
For drinks, we have
water and juice.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.757
We didn't give them much thought

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.093
since we were
so focused on food.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.470
And then Miss
Li Ling recommended

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.306
we add some more unique
beverages to the menu as well.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.724
Thus, our dilemma.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.017
I gotcha now.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.186
Though, I'm starting
to regret my idea.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.647
We all had everything
settled, too.

No, your opinion is valuable.

Don't ever feel like you
can't voice your thoughts.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:03.071
Anyway, we don't have a lot
on hand in terms of drinks.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.739
Then, we remembered
the dante tea

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.575
that you're so fond of, Manager.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.201

That's gonna have to stay
my little secret, I think.

If we had more time,
it'd be okay,

but there's no way I can
get enough ingredients now.

Staying stocked up on it
must be tough,

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.551

what made us think

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:28.263
it'd be great for our stall.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.380
Yes, I'm so excited
for the festival

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.049
that I doubt I'll get
a wink of sleep tonight!

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.677
Yeah. Me, too.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.053
[yawns]

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.471
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:41.391
I promise I wasn't yawning
out of boredom or anything.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.268
[CALLUM]
No one would suspect that.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.603
Not when you jumped straight
from hunting down treants

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.065
to spending an entire day
prepping for a festival.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:52.569
So, please, take off tomorrow
and get some overdue rest.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.237
Leave the preparations to us.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.240
Slack all day? Just me?

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.409
But everyone else
has been busy, too.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.871
Your health should always
come before your work, sir.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.999
So, it would be best if you
used tomorrow to recover.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.125
Then, you'll be raring to go

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.587
once the festival
actually arrives.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.088
He does have a point.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.426
Yeah, okay.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.220
Tomorrow, I'm officially
taking the whole day off.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:23.099
Hey, everyone!
You've all earned a nice,

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.811
hot, and delicious dinner,
so come and get it!

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.605
[RYOMA]
Thanks, Miss Jane!

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.990
[gasps] So, this is what

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.868
a level eight multiplication
skill can do!

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.999
[gasps]

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.542
[laughs]

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.926
[gasps]

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:58.927
Wait!

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:03.264
Hold on, is that from the
Dragoon's Guild in Lenaf?

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.939
And there's Mister Pioro!

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.446
--[PRENANCE] My marvelous...
--[MAIYA] I'm not fat yet,

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.989
so bring on the grub!

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.824
--I'm talking here!
--[SORDIO] For the love...

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.162
[CALLUM]
Bow to your right is Carla.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.914
Bow to your left is Callum.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:28.957
Got it?

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.755
[RYOMA panting]

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.549
I just knew it.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.968
Mister Pioro!

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:45.807
Well, look who it is!
S'been a while, huh, Ryoma?

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.643
[RYOMA panting]

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.686
Yeah.

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:52.438
But why are you
all the way out here?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.481
Taking a walk?

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.775
[RYOMA]
Mm-mm. Thought your monster

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.902
was from the Dragoon's Guild.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:00.738
Then I saw you riding it,
and knew I was right!

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.782
Your eyes must be really good.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.701
We were pretty high up.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.161
Ryoma, today is a workday

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.539
and Carla said you're
hosting a festival stall.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.666
No time to chase flying beasts.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:15.128
True, except I'm under orders
to take the full day off.

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:17.755
We finished setting up
the stall yesterday.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:21.301
Enough about me. What are
you doing here in Gimul?

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:23.761
[PIORO] Got an urgent purchase
from outta nowhere.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.890
Said they wanted it delivered
to Gimul today, no matter what.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.017
Must be really important.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:33.271
Right? I bet it's got something
to do with the festival.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.856
But who knows?

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.108
The merch they asked for's
really rare stuff,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.569
so it's hard to say what
they could be using it for.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.071
Your curiosity got the
better of you, didn't it?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:46.159
Well, I was already planning
on attending the festival.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.080
It worked out; I just
got here a little early.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:52.874
Fancy meeting you here.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.460
[RYOMA]
Hey, Mister Asagi!

00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.047
Hang on, you know one another?

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.424
Yeah. He's a veteran adventurer.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.677
We recently did a job together.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:08.389
Wait, you're the one who
put in that rush order?

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.267
Yeah. Fresh food from
Dragonewt village.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:14.020
Plentiful miso, soy sauce,
and white rice.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.981
Thanks to Ryoma, I knew
it was top quality.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.816
Placed my order without delay.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.027
What a pleasant surprise.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.821
Got some free advertising
out of feeding you, huh?

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.698
[RYOMA]
Uh-huh. Guess you did!

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.078
Just never expected
he'd buy some so soon.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:31.788
Why, though?

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.749
Did you use up the shares
I gave you already?

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.419
No, but something rather
unexpected happened.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:39.629
[BOTH]
Like what?

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.798
I would explain, but I'm
under a time crunch here,

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.885
so I really must be on my way.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.054
If you're that curious,
you can come.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.597
Ryo-mya!

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:54.143
[RYOMA laughs nervously]

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:58.106
Miya, I doubt he finds your
embrace very comforting.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.191
He's here for a story, not hugs.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.527
Meow.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.988
So, you came just to hear
Asagi spin a yarn?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.659
Oh and meow'd you come
to meet this tom-cat?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.203
Well, took ya long
enough to notice.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.914
This is Mister Pioro
of the Lenaf merchants.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:18.251
He came to personally deliver
my Dragonewt Village order.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.627
Very thoughtful.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.921
[RYOMA] We were curious
about Mister Asagi's plans

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:25.216
for his goods,
so we came to find out.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:30.179
Miss Miya, that's the framework
for a festival stall, isn't it?

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.433
Mew have a great eye!
Guess the cat's outta the bag!

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.644
[ASAGI]
Mm. It's as you deduced, Ryoma.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.896
We had a last-minute idea
to open a stall

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.023
for the Foundation Festival.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.818
Huh. You're an interesting duo.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.445
[ASAGI]
Mm-hm...

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.822
Asagi! I am begging!

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.450
Make me that
meowth-watering food!

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:53.202
Can you specify,
please? What kind?

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.955
Mew know! The crunchy stuff
Ryoma cooked for us

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.207
after we kicked the
treants' sorry tails!

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.792
The veggies that
brought you to tears!

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.586
Remember meow?

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.755
Ah, okay. You mean
tempura, right?

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:08.176
Tempurr-ah! If you make me
some more of that deliciousness,

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.344
I'll be the most grateful,
smitten kitten!

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:14.348
[sighs] It's not that
I mind, but why me?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.851
Ryoma was the one
who cooked it for you.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.979
I went to see him first,
but it looked like he had

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:23.191
his hands tied with
festival shenanigans.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:27.862
I didn't wanna be a mew-sance.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.363
I see.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:32.408
Then you realized I know
how to cook tempura, too.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.618
Mew guessed it!

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.454
I also figured that you'd
have nothing better to do!

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.706
You what?

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.375
[sighs] It doesn't matter.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.877
My stomach was growling,

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.254
so I was about to whip
something up anyway.

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.591
[gasps]

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.301
Don't have mountain
vegetables on hand,

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.596
so I substituted
in some regular ones.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.016
And I also made some white rice
and miso soup as side dishes.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.936
You're the cat's pajamas, Asagi!

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:08.653
Did I get it right?

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.488
There should be a slight
difference in the taste

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.282
you recall since I used my
village's secret techniques!

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.034
I would describe
the flavor as...

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:20.122
[MIYA]
Yummy! It's too good to be true!

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.791
Ryo-mya's version
was paw-some,

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.459
but you turned some
ordinary veggies

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.212
into extraordinary veggies!

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:29.882
I just can't believe it.
Meow is this pawsible?

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:30.716
Asagi!

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:31.759
Uh-huh?

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.261
There something
you'd like to share?

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:35.137
Share being the opurrative word,

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.266
'cause we have to share this
goodness with everybody!

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.685
Hey! We should sell
this dish at the festival!

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.603
[ASAGI]
Um, sure.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.647
[gasps]

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.190
That's when I placed my order.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:49.068
[MIYA] His tem-purr-a will make
the townsfolk grin like cats

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.528
that caught canaries!

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.573
Plus, it'll add some flavor
to the festival!

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.033
Is it that good?
May we try it?

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:04.959
Oh, wow. Everything the
young lady told us was true!

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.795
That's a whole lotta yum!
You have to try this!

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.755
Okay. Here goes.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.344
Holy smokes!

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.471
That sure is delicious,
all right!

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.390
The breading couldn't
be more perfect,

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.351
and the flavor of the
vegetables is so pronounced!

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:25.271
Yes, well. I've actually
practiced quite a bit

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:28.566
since Miya and I decided
to open our own festival stall.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.610
Perhaps my craft
has improved a tad.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:33.613
[RYOMA] Mm-hm. Oh, man,
your stand is gonna be amazing!

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.156
These things'll
definitely sell like--

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:40.328
[MIYA] Ha, ha, ha! Now, Ryom-ya,
there's more to it.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:41.329
More?

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.330
That's correct.

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.957
Tempura won't be the
only thing our stall sells.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:48.669
We intend to add white rice and
miso soup to the menu as well.

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.463
White rice and miso soup?

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.424
I mean, they're delicious,
but for a big festival?

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.468
[ASAGI]
I understand your concern.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.053
People do prefer walking

00:18:57.094 --> 00:19:00.473
while they eat at such
events, but still.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.350
There is a meow-thod
to our madness!

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.353
Tempurra tastes even better
with the white rice and soup!

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.480
It's a fact I can't deny.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.565
And the whole point
is to allow the townsfolk

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.150
to enjoy something delicious!

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:14.153
Compromising taste to
suit other expectations,

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.781
that's never been my way,
and it never will be.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.206
[RYOMA gasps]
All right, then.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.958
Could we serve the sides
in a different way?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.001
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.130
Ooh! Paw-dorable!

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.173
Look at 'em!

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.717
[PIORO]
This is a remarkable idea!

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.344
What're they called?

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.554
[RYOMA]
These are "tenmusu."

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.140
Same great taste, but you
can eat 'em on the go!

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.393
I've heard of rice balls,
but I've never put anything

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.561
apart from pickled
plums inside them.

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:50.314
[PIORO] In my professional
opinion, these'll sell!

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:53.109
Thanks for your
ex-purr-tise, Ryo-mya!

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.113
[laughs]

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.864
[ASAGI]
You have my thanks as well.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.658
Happy to be of help.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.868
The festival will be
even better now!

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.250
Bye for meow!
Be safe getting home!

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.002
Stopping by your stall
is a still a top priority!

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.588
Try and make time
to come by ours, too!

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.715
'Kay!

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.762
Tenmusu, what a great concept.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.265
Mind if I also
sell 'em at my store?

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.642
Like they said, gotta
share the goodness.

00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:28.018
I don't mind one bit.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.104
Stuffing them with things
like fried meats and fish

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.439
would taste good, too.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.233
That does sound good.
I can almost taste it.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:38.112
Have to try it for real
once I'm back in Lenaf.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.823
Well, it's been fun. Always is.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.200
I'll stop by your place
for more fun tomorrow.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.453
Alrighty, we'll be waiting.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.997
Come hungry, because if
there's one thing we have,

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:49.582
it's unique cuisine.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.668
Yeah? I like unique!

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.211
See ya around.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.337
I hope so!

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.433
[TEKUN]
How's our boy Ryoma doing?

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.101
He's as awesome as ever.

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:11.145
Take a look.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.774
[TEKUN] Aw. That smile's
almost as big as he is.

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:15.941
[KUFO]
I know!

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:18.652
[FERNOBELIA] You seem
exceptionally upbeat, Kufo.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:21.030
You're acting pretty
exceptional, yourself!

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:24.617
How long has it been since you
ventured out of your realm, huh?

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:27.912
I'm intrigued by all
of Reoma's slime research.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:31.373
It could lead to some
rather advantageous effects

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.751
on the magical properties
of Seilfall one day.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:34.752
Oh!

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.253
I take it that your
cheerful demeanor

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.631
is also a result of that boy?

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:41.759
Yeah. If Ryoma's
having fun, I am, too.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.969
[FERNOBELIA]
His happiness makes you happy?

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.888
[KUFO]
That goes without saying.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.349
We invite people to our world
so they get another chance

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.184
to live a fulfilling life.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.394
'Course I love it
when they actually do.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.106
No further queries.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:01.487
[KUFO] Keep enjoying your
life to the max, Ryoma.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:05.032
Surrounded by the people
who make it all worthwhile.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:13.374
Everyone, let's do our
best come tomorrow!

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.543
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.712
[RYOMA]
Elia, it's finally here!

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.924
Once the sun rises,
it's festival time!
