[ELIARIA]
Dear Mister Ryoma,

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.597
the start of the new term
is quickly approaching,

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.558
so I'll be moving into a
capital dormitory soon!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.978
This is my very first time
to be living on my own.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.814
I have to admit,
I'm a bit scared.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.817
That's a secret not
even my family knows.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.403
But I'm telling you because
your emotional support

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.365
will no doubt help me persevere!

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.824
There should be
an upcoming festival

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.452
held in Gimul,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.914
I hope everyone at Bamboo
Forest Laundry enjoys it!

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.749
[RYOMA]
Elia is moving out.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:44.211
Be great if I could send her
a gift for the occasion.

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.964
The question is what.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.633
Miss Carla had a good idea!

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.718
If you think about it,
clothing's actually

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.887
a great present to give someone.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.305
Because when people look nice,

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:57.224
they can't help
but to feel nice, too.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.977
So it's like you're
wishing them well.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.396
Or something along those lines.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.982
Wait, how am I supposed
to pick an outfit

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.441
for her, though?

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.985
I'm so clueless about
what's "in vogue,"

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.696
I don't even know
if people still say that.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:18.453
I could try flowers,
gift cards, gold coins, nah.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.123
There's my new
deodorant solution.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.543
Consumable gifts are nice
since they don't waste space.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:28.213
This case calls for something
made by hand, though.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.423
I got it!

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.858
[RYOMA]
Perfection.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.235
Just have to let it
sit for a while, then...

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.281
Voila! Handmade soap!

00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:56.491
But I can do better.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.493
I can improve the foam
and feel if I change

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.162
the composition a little.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.664
Maybe even enhance the scent!

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:03.707
I know!

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.542
I'll mold 'em in the
shape of some of Elia's

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.752
favorite things!

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:11.757
Bingo!

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:18.555
What else did Elia
mention in her letter

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.724
apart from moving
to the capital?

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.392
Something about a festival?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.041
[RYOMA] May I have a moment
of your time, Mister Callum?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.251
Of course, sir.

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:12.669
My attention is yours.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.337
[RYOMA] I have it on good
authority that Gimul

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.339
will be holding a festival soon.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.593
I was just curious if you
knew anything about that.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.679
Hmm... No, I'm
afraid that I don't.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:23.764
Should I look into it?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.475
Nah. Though I appreciate
you wanting to help.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.143
I was only asking.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.646
Well, neither one of us have
lived in this town very long.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.398
You should ask someone who has.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.442
That's a good call,
and I do know a local

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:36.777
who grew up here!

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.655
[RYOMA] Sorry to bother
you, Mister Dolce.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:41.865
[DOLCE]
You're fine.

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:44.493
Do you know about
any festivals coming up?

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.744
[DOLCE]
Hmm.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.412
Only thing that'd
happen this time of year

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.080
is the Founding Festival.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.457
[RYOMA]
And what is that?

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.668
A celebration to honor the
day they founded Gimul.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.837
How exactly do you celebrate?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.508
With stalls on main street.
All kinds of 'em.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.635
Traveling performers also come.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.928
They're a sight to see.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.888
These stalls, are they
put on by the town's

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.473
shop owners, by chance?

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.642
Well, you can apply for a stall

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:12.145
regardless of what you own,
but it's not mandatory.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.105
[RYOMA]
A festival stall.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.066
It might be worth looking into.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.319
If our employees are
interested, that is.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.112
I guess there's one more thing.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.739
We sometimes hold
a cleaning event

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.658
once the festivities end.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.784
That's great!

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.787
I asked because I wanna take
part as a way to give back.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.872
Gimul's been really good to us.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:31.998
I see.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.751
Well, that's the extent
of my answer for you.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.378
And it was perfect!

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.129
Thanks for being so detailed!

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.090
Oh, don't mention it.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.508
Know what's funny?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.343
You're the only local
that we've hired.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.221
Everybody else is from
somewhere outside of Gimul.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.389
[DOLCE]
That a fact?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.348
[RYOMA]
Yes!

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.184
Mister Callum was introduced
to us through Mister Serge

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.103
and is from a town
called Louiam,

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.938
while Mister Fei
and Miss Li Ling

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.107
hail from the country of Gilmar.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.901
Miss Selma's at least from
the same country as us,

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.987
but that's where the
similarities stop.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.197
Miss Jane, Miss Fina,
and Miss Maria

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.074
aren't from Gimul,
but they do hail

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.118
from the same village.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.744
I'm glad we have
someone who's in touch

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.162
with the local community.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.164
That's the point
I'm trying to get at.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.083
[DOLCE chuckles]

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.334
There you are!

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.752
Did you need me?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.546
I just received word
from my sister

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:21.631
who's at the Lenaf location.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.258
That's unusual.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.176
Did Miss Carla reach out
because something happened

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.553
at the second shop?

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.264
Yes. For reasons that are
not yet known to us,

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.309
all of their cleaner slimes
have begun to multiply.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.060
[RYOMA]
Without any warning?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.145
Right.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.022
And now there are far too
many for Mister Caulkin

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.190
and the others to contract with.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.692
Heard loud and clear.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.110
I'll leave as soon as I can.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.033
The slimes seemed
a lot giddier than usual

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.327
when they heard about
the brand-new ones!

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.661
But no time to waste!

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:03.214
[RYOMA]
Whoa! That's one giant crowd!

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.424
You're here!

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.301
[RYOMA] I came as fast as
I could once I heard about

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.178
the cleaner slimes.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.639
Of course. Right this way.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.266
[CAULKIN]
Boss! Thank goodness!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.686
[RYOMA]
Yep, that's a lot of slimes.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.480
These are just the ones
you weren't able to form

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.607
contracts with, is that right?

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:24.069
Yes, indeed.
A total of 75 slimes left.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.196
[RYOMA]
That's quite a population boom.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.739
Anyway, contracts!

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.245
Nice! Our contract's complete.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.580
Glad to have you on.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.123
Welcome to the team, everyone!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.085
[CAULKIN]
Wow.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.796
You tamed every excess
cleaner slime that we had!

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.965
Thought of anything that
might've caused this?

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.300
Slimes don't multiply
so fast for nothing.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:50.971
Here's what our investigation
helped us piece together.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.055
All of this?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.515
That's very impressive.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.684
Written in such
a short time, too.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.686
Made fast and efficiently, sir.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:01.189
Tony and Lobelia are the reason
it's as good as it is, honestly.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.649
I see.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.235
This branch is even busier
than our original shop,

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.528
meaning more slime food.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.113
So, the slimes were
making more solution

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.781
than we could sell.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.783
We limited the amount of
solution that they were

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.952
allowed to produce,
and the backup of nutrients

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.579
in their systems must've
led them to multiply.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.790
[RYOMA] And they'll continue
to multiply unless we

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.084
do something with that energy.

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.003
From now on we won't
limit the production

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.671
of deodorizing solution.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.256
We'll just let them make
as much as they want,

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.300
then simply discard
whatever we can't use.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.971
Whoa. So simple, yet so genius!

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.223
Let's try it out!

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.726
Not only did they identify
the cause of the problem,

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.395
they thought up a
great way to solve it.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:44.566
I'm so glad these people
decided to work here with me!

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.193
They're also some of the
few individuals in the world

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:50.321
who'd be willing to spend their
whole night discussing slimes.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.164
Okay, now back to Gimul.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.208
Or maybe I'll pop in and say a
quick hi to Mister Pioro first.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.341
[RYOMA]
Uh-- Weird barrels.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.430
Ugh! Jeez! That reeks!

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.515
[PIORO]
Hey there! Nice timing!

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.933
What's good, Ryoma?

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.226
[RYOMA]
Nothing's good!

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.312
Not with those stinking
up the place!

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.022
[PIORO] That would be
compliments of some of my

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.066
younger staff members.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.526
They brought these barrels
stuffed with fermented fish

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.819
called "shappaya."

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.407
Check it out. Ew, ugh!

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.453
It actually makes for
great preserved food,

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.206
but the smell gets everywhere,
so is it really worth it?

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.500
[RYOMA] Reminds me of
"kusaya" from back on Earth.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.337
[PIORO] You've got all sorts
of tricks up your sleeve.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.422
Can you do something
about this smell?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:52.926
[RYOMA]
Never shy about making requests.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.302
Wait.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.012
[MIYA]
You're making hiss-tory!

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.515
This new item will
fur-ever improve the lives

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.225
of cat beastkin everywhere!

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.019
Like, my hopes couldn't
be higher right meow!

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.522
Well, you may be in
luck, Mister Pioro.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.525
I'd be happy to run a little
test, with your permission.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:11.569
Yes! Stop all my customers
from running away!

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.488
You have my full approval!

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.906
I hope it works.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.032
Yoo-hoo!

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.408
C'mere, deodorant slime.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.538
[PIORO]
A deodorant slime?

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.997
What's this one do?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.500
Eats smells like this for
breakfast, that's what!

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:29.129
And it makes a fluid that
absorbs any kind of odor.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.506
This is somehow different
from the deodorizing fluid

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.007
your other slimes make?

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.677
Yeah.
It's an entirely new slime.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:37.887
The stuff it makes is better
for dampening odors

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.389
over large areas.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.392
Normal cleaner slimes can't
do what this one does.

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.561
Here. Go show him what I mean.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.993
That awful stench
is completely gone!

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:03.246
Bad news is that the effect only
lasts for about a day or so.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.290
The good news is I have
some solution for you

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.583
in this baggie.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.335
Thanks! Always so generous!

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.337
Such a good deed must be repaid!

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.674
All righty!

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.093
How about you document how
long the stench stays gone

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.262
and keep me updated
as a way to repay me?

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.181
That really all you want?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.141
[RYOMA] Knowledge is a
valuable commodity,

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.602
and this kind of
data is priceless.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.520
You're too modest
for your own good.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.314
I know, take this!

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.983
You've earned at least
one barrel, if not more!

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.401
A whole barrel?

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:34.319
Uh-huh.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.487
This will make your trek back
to Gimul even easier.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.031
Pop the top and...

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.660
...send monsters running!

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.788
A strategy that stinks, but also
doesn't at the same time.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.374
Yeah! I really like it.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.959
Thank you for the idea!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:50.960
S'what I do.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.837
Now, have a safe
journey back home.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.088
Right!

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.133
Oh, wait, I was sorta hoping
I could say hi to Miss Miyabi

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.551
before I left.
If she's not busy, that is

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:03.389
Aw. Tough luck, kiddo.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.558
Miyabi's on her way
to the royal capital.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.269
Probably taking a nap in
the carriage as we speak.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.357
Wow! She did it!

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.985
Wait a second, you wanna
study at the academy?

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.195
[MIYABI]
Yeah.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.571
Great way to make
good connections

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.115
as a future businessperson.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.408
Yeah, for what's it's worth,

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.202
I'm also bummed
she left so early.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.870
Could've given her
some monster-repelling

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.163
shappaya, too.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.539
Too bad.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.959
Some folks might like fermented
fish as a parting gift,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.418
but she's not one of 'em.

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:35.755
You're always like
this around me.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.257
Do I stink?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.136
[SELMA]
Make it stop!

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.138
Oh, please, make it stop!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.688
[RYOMA]
There we go!

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:54.357
Mister Pioro was right,
that gross fish barrel

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.901
kept anything from
messing with me.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.736
[CALLUM] I'm a little bit
surprised to see you back

00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.821
so soon.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:03.116
Oh? I just had to contract
the remaining slimes.

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:04.534
They all handled the rest.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.202
Good to know it's resolved.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.121
Now that you're home,
Mister Serge was looking

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.164
to schedule a meeting
with you, sir.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.666
I've got some time.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.294
Should I be heading to the
Morgan Trading Company, or?

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:17.505
No. He wanted to visit you here.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.799
Huh? I'm ready whenever he is.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.302
Especially if he's gonna make
it easy and come to us.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.636
I'll go tell him.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.347
Oh, yes! There is one
other thing, sir.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.849
What would that be?

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.559
We were given a little present.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.561
It's from Miss Fina
and the others' town.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:32.729
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.397
I believe Miss Jane's on break.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.607
Perhaps she'll be
willing to fill you in.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.776
She knows more about
it than I do, at least.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.948
So embarrassing, right?

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.784
Our folks sent these
without saying a word.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.662
They claimed it's
a "gift," but...

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.122
...it's really a bribe.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.623
Talk about blunt!

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.918
Gifts like this are actually
a fairly common thing,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.003
but it's nice.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.796
Parents can't guarantee
their children's employers

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.132
treat them well, so they
send gifts to gain favor

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.342
and up the odds.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.760
[RYOMA]
Guess that makes sense.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:06.429
This is a thank-you for already
treating us well, though.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.306
For you and everyone
working here.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.266
A buncha wheat and semesa.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.392
Semesa?

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.479
[JANE] Oh, a homegrown
crop from our village.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.480
[RYOMA]
I see.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.692
That's pretty fragrant.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.570
Like, enough to add some
nice flavor to foods!

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.323
Maybe this is Seilfall's
version of sesame.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.784
What a wonderful gift!

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.328
I'm grateful, but isn't this
a little bit too much?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.287
Nah.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.790
I mean yes, it's quite a lot,
but everything we got

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.917
are leftovers they
weren't able to sell.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.502
Man, that's concerning.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.253
Are they doing okay?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.089
[laughs] I think so.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.216
In any case,
let your parents know

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:46.469
they don't have to send gifts
to ensure your wellbeing.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.262
I hope you've figured
out I don't need bribes

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.390
in order to treat
employees right.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.516
Yes, I know.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.184
I'm very sorry.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.521
Obviously, I'm not a parent,
so I can't truly empathize.

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.940
I know love when
I see it, though.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.400
So don't apologize.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.111
I'm all for parents showing
their kids they really care.

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.779
Thanks, boss.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.781
What's all this wheat
and semesa cost?

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:10.034
Tell me if you find out so I can
pay your folks the full price.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.327
No, don't you dare!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.329
It would be way
too expensive, sir!

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.706
They're at fault for
sending without asking us!

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.042
You know we have a kitchen
with an awesome cook, right?

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.794
So it'll get used.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.547
And besides, can't afford
to send this much for free

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.841
if they're having trouble
with sales 'cause it'll only

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:26.843
drive the prices down more.

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:29.554
So to make sure these here
grains retain their value,

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.265
I'd much prefer to pay
what they're really worth.

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:35.643
'Kay. But maybe pay as
little as you possibly can.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.604
[RYOMA] Then would covering
the base cost plus shipping

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.732
be considered as little
as possible, or not?

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.359
Sure. That'll work.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:45.695
Thank you again.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:46.821
You're great.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.198
Likewise. Thanks for
being on the team.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.494
I'll have a chat with Mister
Pioro sometime soon.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.122
See if he can start buying
crops from their village.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.832
Gotta make sure this
wheat and semesa

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.584
is quality stuff first, though.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.675
[SERGE] Let's start with
a little progress report.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.138
[RYOMA]
Oh, wow!

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.890
Is this the finished product?

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:14.849
Yes.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.059
Everything's already
lined up to start sales.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.686
Mister Dinome's
working hard to ensure

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.521
we're stocked up.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.648
He and his apprentices
are increasing our general

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.193
inventory as we speak.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.195
The Founding Festival
might be a good time

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.613
for the grand reveal.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.448
You really think so?

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.742
You're planning to sell
them out of a stall, then?

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.286
Yes. It would be quite fitting.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.413
The Semroid Troupe's
playing at the festival.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.081
They're the ones
who composed the tune

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.750
the music boxes play.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.668
Yeah, that is pretty fitting,

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.087
but I've never heard
of this troupe.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.839
[SERGE] They're a group
of traveling entertainers

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.758
led by a popular bard.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.386
In fact, his popularity has only
recently been on the rise,

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.805
but he's also young,
so he has his whole career

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.890
ahead of him.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.391
How exciting!

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.060
I have to check 'em out now!

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.978
Where will the show be?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.772
Well, it's funny that
you should mention it,

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.315
but we were hoping
to use the empty lot

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.900
right next door to your shop.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.735
What?

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.029
Guess that business did move.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.490
We've just been using
it for security training.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.825
If it's possible, we were
hoping to borrow your shop

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.537
as well or rather a portion
of it that we'll use

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.163
as a sort of greenroom.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.456
My shop?

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.416
It's not really designed
to serve that purpose,

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.960
but I think one of
the dorms could work

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.670
as a makeshift greenroom.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.463
So how does all that sound?

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.675
Ooh, I believe we
have ourselves a deal.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.510
I'm most grateful to you.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.636
Heh.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.639
This is payback for all the
times you supported me.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.433
If I have the power to
return a few favors, I will!

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:49.485
Man! So much happened
in just one day!

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.529
But what do I do now?

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.738
[SELMA yelps]

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.199
Wait, that was Miss Selma!

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.537
Hey, I'm here!
Are you okay?

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.165
Oh, I'm fine.

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:07.044
But the fish, every last
scale smells rotten.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.714
Crap! Forgot to mention
the shappaya, did I?

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.345
Is something wrong?

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:19.181
That scent. I know it.

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.434
Gosh, not only is it familiar--

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:22.935
It's making my mouth water!

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:25.229
Yeah! Mine, too! Wait!

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.568
It's the smell of semesa!

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.236
Wow. Guess the nose knows.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:36.240
It certainly knows that
aroma smells delicious!

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.659
It's funny, since it
smelled horrid before.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.745
Huh. Never would've guessed.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.205
It's downright delightful now.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.541
Well, actually...

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.501
We only used deodorizing
fluid to remove

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.629
the shappaya's strong
scent at first.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.757
The one from the deodorant
slime, since it's so potent.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.968
Though it did improve the smell,
it didn't eliminate it entirely.

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.604
Not bad!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.607
Why does it still
taste off, though?

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.276
It does have its own flavor.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.363
At least now it's only
mildly unpleasant.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.782
Perhaps we can disguise the
lingering scent with herbs!

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.409
It might add a nice
flavor to the fish, too

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.827
Sure, let's try it.

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.330
Oh, yeah! We can use the semesa!

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.999
We do have plenty to go around!

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:29.418
So we squeezed a little
oil out of the semesa,

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.712
then took the deodorized
shappaya and fried 'em up

00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:33.089
real good in it!

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.507
Awesome call, Manager.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.550
The semesa scent
is working wonders!

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.052
I can't wait to try it!

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:39.970
C'mon, let's go
get everyone else!

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.683
[RYOMA] I'm glad they're
so excited for this.

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.228
[LI LING]
That was delicious.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.646
As always!

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.232
Miss Selma and the manager
make a great cooking duo!

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:54.860
Thank you. Maybe I can whip up a
dish or two from your hometown

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.529
one of these days as well.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.072
That'd be lovely!

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.241
I was beginning to miss
Gilmar's cuisine lately,

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.742
so I might even join
you in the kitchen

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:03.285
as long as you'll have me.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.498
I love being able to enjoy
food from all over!

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.542
I believe this semesa
fried shappaya could be

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.752
the start of exotic food nights!

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:12.503
Huh.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:15.506
Wait, what?
Why are you "huh-ing?"

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.050
I'm thinking we should open
a stall for the festival.

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:18.968
Huh?

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.804
[CALLUM] We're already lending
our space to the Semroid Troupe,

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:24.098
so why not serve exotic
food for the audience

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.308
who comes to watch them perform?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.853
It's certainly doable,
what with our employees

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.563
being from so many places.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.232
Could put a bunch of
different items on the menu.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.692
Just think about it.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.069
People go to festivals
to spend money.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:38.320
It's part of it.

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:40.072
Why not try to bond
with the locals here

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:42.366
while profiting financially?

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.576
Um...

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:45.494
I have no doubt a stall
like that would make

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.079
the people of Gimul happy,

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:50.374
but what about the
people of this shop?

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.334
What does everyone else think?

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.545
This would entail labor
outside your duties,

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:55.838
so I won't force it.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.133
And we'd all have to miss part
of the festival as well.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.343
I'll help. It's a good idea.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.928
What a surprise!

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.556
This establishment's great,
and though I'm new,

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.558
I already know that
I want to stay.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.684
I like it here.

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.061
You really make that
choice a simple one, sir.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.940
So, yes.
I'd like to help any way I can.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.568
I love when lots of people get
a chance to eat my cooking,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.904
so I would also
be happy to help.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.448
Give festivalgoers
something to remember!

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.074
That's the spirit!

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:27.787
And I'll show everyone the kind
of punch Gilmar cuisine packs!

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.246
--Yay!
--Ooh, yum!

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.331
Oh, yeah!

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:31.499
We have all that wheat!

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.918
Surely it can be used for a
whole slew of different recipes!

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.920
I don't foresee an issue
as long as we can keep it

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.130
stored fresh until
it's festival time.

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.507
An excellent idea.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:40.758
All right!

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.384
We could even sell
the wheat at the stall

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.386
as a way to help
advertise the village!

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.013
People like the food
made from wheat,

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:48.265
but do they really care
about where it's from?

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.976
Never know, so let's find out!

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.187
Well, either way count me in!

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:56.357
Sounds like it'll be fun! Right?

00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.150
It also sounds like
this thing's gonna call

00:21:58.192 --> 00:21:59.693
for some major décor.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:00.945
[FINA]
Mm-hmm/

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:01.987
Okay, then!

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:04.365
Everyone in favor of
applying for a festival stall

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:05.616
of our own, say "aye!"

Aye!

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.372
[RYOMA] Now all of Bamboo
Forest is looking forward

00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:13.624
to the Founding Festival.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.042
I hope this goes well.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:20.631
No, I'll work hard to
make sure it goes well!
