WEBVTT

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.223
Layout number one, complete!

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.266
You think we should
change anything?

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.185
If we had a wider space
just for the goods,

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.854
we could show off the
merchandise a little better.

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:22.439
Let's redesign it then.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:24.650
If you please.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.240
[LI LING]
Yeah! Looks good!

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.325
A festival calls
for decorations!

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.910
We want it to look fun!

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.204
They're all getting really
into it, aren't they?

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:39.289
The preparations are
going so smoothly.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.332
Yeah, I know.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.125
All of the excitement and
positivity in the room

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.460
is contagious!

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:44.628
Makes our job easy!

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.470
[RYOMA] Rehearsals for the
The Semroid Troupe's show

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.180
are underway, too.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.808
Are they using magic to
make their swords shine?

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.810
What a cool special effect!

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.312
[WORGAN]
Hey! How's it goin', Ryoma?

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.231
Guessing I caught you
on your way home?

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:07.067
[RYOMA]
Yep. Good guess, Mister Worgan.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.443
You got a moment?

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.861
Just one.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.989
[WORGAN] First, I wanna thank
you for taking that tunnel

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.073
ant job.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.325
Thought you were planning
to be a full-time merchant,

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.995
so it was nice to see
your face round our guild.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.746
And a little birdy told me
you're trying to get

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.415
your adventurer rank up.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.457
That's right.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.002
I realize it's a goal that's
gonna take me a minute,

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.587
but I'm shooting for it.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.880
Well, it's hard to put
your focus on one thing

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.924
when you're juggling
so much, kid.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.884
Can't be a full-time
adventurer when you've got

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.845
a business to run.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.597
But since you're
still part time,

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.974
are you at all available
for the next couple days?

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:40.350
I actually am.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.602
Perfect.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:44.479
'Cause there's a certain job
I could use your help with.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.065
The actual task is
gathering materials,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.818
but they're asking for a ton,
so we need a space magic

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.486
user to store 'em.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.572
A bonus perk for you
is it involves hunting

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.240
one of the monsters
on your list.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.575
Are you kidding me?

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:57.576
'Course not.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.829
Client wants treant wood
so those are our targets.

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.039
[RYOMA]
Hmm.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.373
Treants, huh?

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:07.377
This'll be excellent practice
for my trip to the Great Forest!

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:09.129
Just tell me when we head out!

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.399
[WORGAN] And that's it.
Consider yourselves briefed.

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:53.358
[RYOMA]
Awesome.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.988
Every member of the party Mister
Worgan assembled is reliable.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.283
Question, do the client's
demands not strike you

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.784
as being a tad difficult?

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.536
Three hundred of
anything is a lot,

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.080
but 300 treants is absurd, sir.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.374
What's all of the wood
gonna be used for anyway?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.294
A sort of town renewal
project you could say.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.920
Wait, it needs renewing?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.423
Maybe not now,
but what if Gimul's mines

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.175
run out of ore one day?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.802
The town depends
on that finite resource.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:24.306
Most folks would lose work
then move out and move on.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.099
The proposal to prevent
something like that

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.311
from happening is to build
a new tourist attraction.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.897
It'll be an entirely new
district with its own inns,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.108
taverns, and everything,
just outside the south gate.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.069
And at the very center
will be a fighting arena.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.822
Sounds like fun!
I'm already a big fan!

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.492
Yeah, and it also sounds like
a ton of potential profit.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:44.785
Just think about it.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.120
There's the normal
tourism revenue,

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.456
then all the gambling
on top of it.

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:52.042
That I get, but why's
it have to be treants?

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.961
Wouldn't regular wood
serve the same purpose?

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.713
Architect's special request.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.341
Apparently, the town got
someone famous hired on

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.344
and they've got a reputation
for being bizarre.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.930
An arena made of treant
wood is this guy's vision.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.223
So, yeah.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.891
It's not a bad
building material,

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:11.186
but treant wood is typically
used in crafting wands

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:12.312
for magicians.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.022
So, the architect
certainly lives up to his

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.607
bizarre reputation.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.859
He does, but at least
he puts his money

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.111
where his eccentric mind is.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.404
Hey, Asagi?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.781
You take the lead.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.324
I'd be honored.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.743
Good. I brought in Ryoma
so you'd have a place

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.830
to store your haul, but he would
also like some experience

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.623
fighting treants.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.083
I won't slow you down!

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.085
You're always scratchin' our
backs, so it's about time

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.753
we scratched yours, Ryo-mya!

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.463
Exactly! No worries.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:39.631
[RYOMA chuckles]

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.591
All right.
You're adjourned.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.051
Go home and get some rest,

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.970
then be ready to
head out tomorrow.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.646
[RYOMA] The last time I fought
in a party was when we took out

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.148
those goblins at
the abandoned mines.

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.614
It's been a while.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.533
My heart's racing!

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.493
I'm projecting that we'll
reach the target forest

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.120
by nightfall.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.705
We'll set up camp
once we arrive,

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.040
then start the hunt bright
and early tomorrow morning.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.086
If anyone's interested,
I could go over a few tips

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.297
and tricks for fighting
treants right now.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.214
[RYOMA]
Please!

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.550
They mainly attack by swinging
their branches around,

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.969
so be sure to pay extra
attention to any movement

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.013
coming from above.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.473
Their weakness is the
face-like protrusion visible

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.559
in the middle of the trunk.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.687
Damage this portion itself
or chop off the area below it

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.856
to bring a treant to its end.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:40.108
I do have one concern
about this, Leipin.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.152
Is the face the only way
to tell treants apart

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.361
from other trees?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.529
I sure hope not.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.239
They could easily get the
jump on us if they're all

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.657
turned around.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.744
Unlike regular trees,
treants possess magic.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.245
Which means they're
just as detectable

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.788
as any other monster.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.123
Ah.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.208
Then this should go
off without a hitch.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.128
[RYOMA] I'll have to keep my
magic detection up at all times.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.389
[MIYA]
Purr-fection.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.439
Ooh, what're those things?

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:20.649
They're chairs.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:23.652
See?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.945
Ameowzing!

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.114
And a table.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.033
It folds up like laundry!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.162
A clever way to free up
space while still providing

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.455
the comforts of home.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.791
I'm impressed that such
furniture could be so light,

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.000
yet so sturdy.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.045
Even before I got to Gimul,
I knew I wanted to travel

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:45.215
and see all of Seilfall and
now I can do it in comfort.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.092
That's our little genius!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.885
We're so infurior to you!

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.929
[chuckles]
Oh, it's nothing really.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.889
All I did was replicate
the camping gear

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.183
I wanted back in
my previous world.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.144
Glad they like 'em
as much as me.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.147
Now, once we set foot in those
woods, the beastkin ladies

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.941
and I will take
down the treants.

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.402
Leipin and Ryoma will then
transport the fallen ones

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.987
to a secure location.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.530
Leipin will also be our lookout,

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.408
alerting us to treants
and any other threats.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.535
Should it be necessary,
Ryoma will attend him

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.662
and ensure he's covered.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:19.457
You'll join us in the fight once
the situation stabilizes, Ryoma.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.875
Okay, understood.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:24.713
[ASAGI] And hey, there's no
need to stress yourself out.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.007
You've been like that all day.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.301
I noticed how intense your
focus was in the carriage, too.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.303
This job is a tall order, yes,

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.014
but we're here
tackling it with you.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.765
So go at your own pace.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.475
Thank you for the reassurance.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.643
[MIYA]
If you don't overthink it,

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.854
I'm sure you'll be
feline fine in no time.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.522
'Cause you're just
that cool a cat!

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.149
If there's one thing
I know about you,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.233
it's how sharp you are.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.943
You might know more
about treants than me

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.069
once we're done.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.946
And you've got us to protect
you if you're worried

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.072
you're not skilled enough.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.783
We'll take care of you just
like we have in the past.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.661
And if you get hurt, I'll
be right there to heal you.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:57.954
Thanks a lot.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.581
I couldn't do this without you!

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.793
As much fun as I have
working with my employees

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.838
to run a good business,
I'm also having just as much fun

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.507
with these
experienced adventurers.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.843
I'm learning all
sorts of new things!

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.225
Is everyone ready
to begin the hunt?

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.811
Good. Let's go.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.154
Huh. I believe
I see one already.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.531
Look alive.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.950
Sense anything different
about that thicker tree

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.702
ten meters away from us?

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.953
[MIYA]
That one?

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:39.913
[LEIPIN]
Indeed.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:40.955
[RYOMA]
He's right.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.750
It looks like any other
tree, but I definitely feel

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.710
magic power radiating off it.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.632
Check meowt!

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.141
One treant down.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.643
Which means it's our turn!

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.108
Now! Dimension Home!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.825
These one-hit
sourpusses are nothing!

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.827
I sense a group of three
somewhere up ahead!

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.161
Nicely done, Leipin.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.913
I'll take the one in the center.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.289
The other two are yours.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.469
Take this! Windcutter!

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.395
There's one final treant.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.064
It's the last I sense
in this area, though.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.150
Ryoma, care to do the honors?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.192
You bet!

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.125
Yes! I can handle
one treant, No sweat!

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.294
That deserves a round of a-paws!

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.379
Something seems
off to me, though.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.464
Treants are known
to prefer dark places

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.425
that are especially
deep in the woods.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:18.011
It's rare to spot so many
this close to the outskirts

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.138
where the sun's
shining brightly.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.515
But at least we got
off to a good start.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.684
So let's count our blessings
for now and make our way

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.394
back to camp
for some lunch.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.361
[RYOMA] Mister Leipin's
not the only one.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.198
Something about this
place feels off to me, too.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.326
[MIYA]
Where are you, Ryo-mya?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.668
Fur-get you saw that.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.427
[ASAGI] The slash attack you
used earlier was great, Ryoma.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.721
I think you've proven that you
can handle whatever treants

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.514
we miss when we
go hunting again.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.724
I appreciate it.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.893
That said, don't overdo it.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.770
Your top priority should
be keeping Leipin

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.605
and yourself safe from danger.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:11.564
Right!

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.483
Believe in the cat
that believes in you!

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:16.194
About your sword, it's actually
one of your metal slimes

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.362
in disguise, right?

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.697
Almost.
The scabbard is a metal slime,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.366
while the blade
is an iron slime,

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.825
which is a little different.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:23.910
Well done.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.412
I recall you asking
about buying katanas.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.915
I guess you solved that
issue yourself, huh?

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.125
I'm constantly in awe
of your ability to expand

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.294
the boundaries of
what slimes can do.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.255
Hey. What's that floaty thing?

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.173
[LEIPIN]
Yet another slime!

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.341
[RYOMA]
It is?

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.260
A fluff slime, to be specific.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.595
As you can see, they
have the gift of flight.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.222
I've never even heard of these!

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.890
A slime that can fly?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.643
Mister Leipin, how are
those types caught?

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.770
With the utmost ease, of course.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:51.896
Pick Up!

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:55.358
[RYOMA]
Whoa!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.986
A simple form of Space Magic
that transports a target

00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.570
closer to the caster.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.572
Though it only works
if said target is in

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.284
your line of sight and aiming
can also be difficult,

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.535
to say the least.

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.078
So, not many use it.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.997
It does, however,
have the unique benefit

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.457
of capturing without
causing harm.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.917
That alone's worth it!

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:13.960
Here you go.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.295
This fluffy guy is yours.

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:16.921
It's only right,
don't you think?

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.965
After all, you're the
slime specialist.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.425
Thank you, Mister Leipin!

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.387
Contract complete.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.140
Monster Appraisal!

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.602
It says its skills are
flight and lighten weight.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.313
Multiplication level eight?

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.859
You lighten weight,
little fella? Wow!

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.820
No wonder since you're almost
weightless yourself, huh?

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.697
[LEIPIN] Its weight isn't
completely zero,

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.199
but it comes remarkably
close, as you can tell.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.952
You're also feeling
the flight skill at work.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.496
Now I'm more eager to
get this job done quickly!

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.123
Can't wait to get home
and figure out a way

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.083
to put its skills to good use!

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.627
Ryo-mya's love of slimes
is the size of a meown-tain!

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.422
I could listen to that
happy boy all day!

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.549
Sometimes I forget
that he's only 11,

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.925
and then he gets a new slime.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.680
Um, we should probably get
back to hunting those treants.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:12.518
No way. You feel that?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.395
It's quite the disturbing
turn of events.

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.355
I'll say.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.981
That area had nothing
but normal trees

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.108
when we entered this
forest a moment ago.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.110
Judging from the magical
power that I'm sensing,

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.571
it feels like more than
half are treants now.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.656
The way you said
that tells me it's bad.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.076
They're appearing too
quickly and in large droves.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.702
So if I had to take a guess,

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:33.206
I'd hypothesize a dangerous
evolved species is close by.

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.875
We can't return with just
a fraction of the lumber.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.044
Continue, but please
proceed with caution.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.004
I'd like to investigate
even if it turns out to be

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.881
something we can't handle.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.967
Compared to us, individual
treants are as flimsy as grass.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:48.346
But we won't get injured as
long as we all stay sharp.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.347
All right.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.848
Let's go cut down some trees.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.863
--[LEIPIN] Now! Windcutter!
--Have a slice of my Windcutter!

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.282
The only danger's passing
out from exhaustion!

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.909
There's no end
to them, is there?

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.287
Healing!

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.252
Thank you for
looking out for us!

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:20.586
Yes! Nice one!

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.629
Stay where you are!

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.548
We need your help on
the offensive, Ryoma!

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.842
Leipin! Provide support!

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.301
I'll do all that I can!

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:40.398
Everyone did an outstanding
job of clearing this area.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.192
However, the grove just
ahead is equally dense.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.695
And of course I mean
with treants, not trees.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.655
We've come too far to stop meow!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.490
Are you sure you
have the stamina?

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.200
There's no shame
in retreat, everyone!

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.410
We're well aware, thanks!

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:53.828
We'll retreat when we need to!

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.163
Safety first!

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.463
[RYOMA] At this rate, we're
gonna wear ourselves out

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.922
in a matter of minutes!

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.384
Wait, Ryoma.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.969
Are you throwing in the towel?

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.804
Nope, I'm picking things up!

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.765
Maximize, guys!
Then separate, too!

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.906
I came up with this
method a while back.

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:33.075
Throwing weapons is great,
but running out of them is not.

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.952
I won't have that problem
if my ammunition

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.787
wiggles its way back
to me, though!

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.791
Ryo-mya, you're so claw-some!

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.168
He's like a one-man army.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.378
Let's cover him while
he takes out the treants!

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.816
[LEIPIN]
I knew it.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.237
Although, I didn't expect
it to be this strong.

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:11.155
[RYOMA]
That's a whole mess of magic.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.157
[LEIPIN]
It's an elder treant.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.244
I've encountered a few
before, but none so large

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.912
or imbued with such
an astounding amount

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.497
of magical energy!

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.208
If we don't do something now,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.336
it could turn the
whole forest into treants.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.004
Asagi said it best before,

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.049
even if we can't handle it,
we should get info, yeah?

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.677
Leipin. Ryoma. Good to go?

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.220
I have plenty of magic left.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.221
Yeah, same.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.390
Believe it or not, I've
hardly used any up till now.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.975
Oh, I certainly believe it.

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.810
Spared yourself from
casting several spells

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:44.188
by turning your slimes
into throwing axes.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.606
It's decided, then!

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.650
Let's take out the elder treant!

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.202
My metal slimes are
scared for some reason.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.458
Ah yes, a commendable choice.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.711
Creatures shaking in fear
shouldn't ever be forced

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:07.670
to fight.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:08.629
Right.

00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:10.381
What were they all
so afraid of, though?

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.555
Stay calm, everyone!

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.266
They are capable of walking,
but their movements are slow!

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.189
[LEIPIN]
It's the elder treant's roots!

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.608
Then I'll use Pavement!

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.700
That'll keep its roots at
bay for a minute or two!

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.536
Leipin and Ryoma, stay there
and provide us with cover!

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.496
Act as their guardian, Cilia!

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.624
The remainder of us will
charge them, head on!

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.504
--Wind cutter, attack!
--Wind cutter, go!

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:00.931
What the heck was that?

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.308
A-paw-ling!

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.480
That was dark magic!

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.524
It can corrode metal weapons
and turn them into piles of rust

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.068
with just one attack.

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.195
How can we fight something
that disintegrates our blades

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:15.613
with its breath?

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.489
I see.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.908
That's what my
slimes were afraid of.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:21.202
Wait, in that case.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.411
Let's Maximize!

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.914
Now Separate!

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:38.719
[RYOMA]
Just as I thought!

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.888
It's not effective
against pure iron!

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.766
Do me a favor, guys!

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.268
Buy me, like, five
seconds of time, okay?

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.937
Catch!

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.313
It's so shiny!

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:51.148
Give him the backup
that he needs!

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.741
[RYOMA]
Good. It's in range!

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.285
[RYOMA yells]

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:09.792
Now go ahead and deliver
the finishing blow.

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.669
Oh, yeah, it should
be Mister Ryoma.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.963
He and his slimes
did most of the work.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.215
Make sure whatever
you do looks cool!

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.258
Okay!

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.350
That was the cat's meow!

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:28.144
Not only did you hunt treants,

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:31.230
you were given a chance
to take down an elder treant.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.189
[RYOMA]
Yeah.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.567
Don't often get to fight
battles like this one.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:37.403
Thanks for allowing me
to deal the finishing blow!

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.447
"Allowed" is one way to put it.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.741
For the record, I asked you
to do it because I trusted

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:42.825
that you could.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.369
That's why I decided I
would cover you at the end.

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.289
Out of trust? Really?

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.041
I'm fairly certain we all have
that kind of faith in you.

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:58.257
[RYOMA] Everywhere I turn
these days, I'm surrounded by

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.967
amazing people.

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:03.220
Best of all, I trust them,
and they trust me.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.438
[RYOMA] Without further ado,
your mountain vegetable tempura.

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:19.069
Who knew mountain veggies could
be cooked in such a tasty way?

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.821
Meow'd you do it?

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.990
Not that I was keeping count
while we were fighting,

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.576
but we definitely met our quota.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.619
Indeed.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.163
And I'm still reeling from
the fact a black-market dealer

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.499
was buried under
that elder treant.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.666
I'm trying to eat here.

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.377
Don't bring up that nasty
skeleton at the dinner table.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:36.545
Sorry.

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:38.631
I thought it relevant since
the magic crystals

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:42.092
buried with him are what granted
the elder treant its power.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.929
It's a very important discovery.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.764
[ASAGI] How can you gab
about that when we have

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.141
miso soup this good
to fill our mouths?

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:50.935
Oh! It tastes like home!

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:54.438
I was able to buy some
soy sauce and miso in Lenaf.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.567
[ASAGI] Lenaf carries such
delights? Magnificent!

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.194
You sure are crying a lot.

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.737
Just an emotional eater?

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:04.073
[ASAGI]
I'm having a moment over here!

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:06.534
I feel so incredibly lucky!

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.286
[WELANNA]
All this over a bowl of soup?

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.915
[RYOMA] I'm glad I snagged those
ingredients from Mister Pioro.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:16.043
Funny how food has the power
to forge such wonderful bonds

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:17.253
and memories.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:21.465
I hope I can make even more
at Gimul's Founding Festival.
