Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil,

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.017
how are you doing?

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.104
I said goodbye to Gimul
for now and am currently

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:26.235
on a solo journey to Lenaf,
but I'm not worried one bit.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.612
I'm actually more excited
than anything since I'll be

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.697
opening up my second shop there!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.657
Wow!

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.784
He's starting a second shop?

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.827
That was pretty quick, huh?

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.538
He's so impressive!

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.506
[RYOMA]
The new town's not much farther.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.842
I wonder what kind of
people I'll meet there.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.137
I can't wait to find out and
tell you all about it, Elia!

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:55.801
So, this is Lenaf.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.096
It may not be as big as Gimul,
but it sure is lively.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.642
All right.
What's the address?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.105
Master Glissela told me
my first move should be

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:11.358
to speak with Lenaf's very
own Mister Pioro Saionji.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.112
Just gotta navigate the town!

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.290
So, this is Mister
Pioro's place.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.334
Saionji Trading Company.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.377
It's huge!

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.713
Don't be shy.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.467
[RYOMA]
They seem really busy.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.969
Should I just leave, or?

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.595
Something tells me I should
since I'm only gonna

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:41.847
be a bother.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:46.309
Man, this stinks,
but that's how it goes.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.728
[MIYABI]
Welcome, young man.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.733
Are you, perhaps, looking for
something in particular?

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.943
Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.737
I'm here for a meeting,
not to shop.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.239
It's with Mister Pioro Saionji.

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.491
You'd rather see my dad
than have a shoppin' spree?

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.534
Your dad?

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.370
Excuse me.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.539
My father's what
brings you here?

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.249
I guess so.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:11.209
[PIORO]
How goes it, kiddo?

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.545
Oh, heya there, Dad.

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.173
[RYOMA]
You must be Mister Pioro.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.507
What's this, Miyabi?

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.717
Is he hitting on you?

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.094
I don't get why your
mind even went there!

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.013
He's really not
flirtin' with ya?

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.181
Aw, what a shame.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.433
Only shameful thing
here is your behavior!

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.602
Well, anyway, the one he's
actually interested in

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.853
talking to is you.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:32.063
Oh, is that right?

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.565
Very nice to meet you.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.942
My name is Ryoma
Takebayshi, sir.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.278
I hail from the mining
town of Gimul.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.406
The master of their Merchant
Guild highly recommended you.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.825
I gotcha!
So you're that Ryoma kid.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.912
As you already figured out,
I'm Pioro Saionji.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.747
Not sure if you're aware,
but your reputation

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.248
kinda precedes you.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.042
Glissela immediately
had my attention

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.627
when she said you own
a laundry service

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.754
that uses slimes!

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.131
Then she mentioned
what brings you to Lenaf.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.841
If you wanna open a
second branch here,

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.593
gotta go to the guild and
sift through mountains

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.303
of paperwork before
anything else can be done,

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.304
I'm afraid.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.139
But you got nothing to
worry about because

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.809
I've got you covered
from start to finish, kid.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.268
[RYOMA]
I appreciate it, sir.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.102
[MIYABI]
Huh?!

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.188
What's with the face, Miyabi?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.273
It's just that... Well, uhm...

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.443
Do you mean a second
branch of a business?

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.737
This kid? Seriously?

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.489
Hard to believe he's a shop
owner when he doesn't

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.825
seem much older than me.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.451
Well, he isn't older than you.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.911
Ryoma is only 11.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.996
So, he's actually
one year younger.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.331
He's just 11?

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.125
Don't be so surprised, sweetie.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.253
Look how uncomfortable he is.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.548
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make it awkward!

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.008
Let's just take this whole
introduction from the top.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.844
I'm Miyabi Saionji,
and I'm honored to make

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:44.886
your acquaintance.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:45.887
Likewise.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.974
I look forward to working with
both of you in this town.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.226
Speaking of names,
the name Miyabi came from

00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:52.686
the daughter of our
ancestor who founded

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.812
the business.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.480
Kinda hoped I'd get a
share of his good luck

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.898
if I called her that.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.316
I mean you never know.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.777
Why are you telling him
our life story, Dad?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.945
It's okay.

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:03.780
I'll bet the name reminded
you of all the things

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.365
she'd achieved, right?

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.575
Not even close!

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.493
I suppose you could say
that the founder's daughter

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.287
was like the poster girl
for living a regular,

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.872
happy life.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:12.956
I get it now.

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.749
Obviously, you wanted your
daughter to live a nice,

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.084
happy life like her, right?

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.043
Naw.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.379
I mean, everybody wants
that stuff for their kiddos.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.339
It's more like I wanted to
bring myself some of that

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.424
good luck.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.217
You wanna hog all
the luck for yourself!

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.094
Sorry! Don't know
what came over me.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.345
No hard feelings.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.347
Pretty sure I deserved to
be sassed back for that,

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.640
wouldn't you agree, Miyabi?

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.517
Absolutely.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.727
Stop goofing off!

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.021
You said there's a bunch he
has to do back at the guild!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.106
Quit wasting time
and go take him there!

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.190
Will do!

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.820
I told you there was
a mountain of paperwork

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.323
waiting for you, but it's
actually gonna be more like

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.365
a hill.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.702
'Cause Glissela asked
me to handle everything

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.662
before you got into town.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.873
So I've already got most
of the complicated stuff

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:56.249
taken care of for you.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.001
No need to worry about things
like where you're gonna

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.586
set up shop.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.296
All that's left is for
you to take a look through

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.173
some documents and
sign on the dotted line

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.341
if you approve.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.800
That's literally it.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.636
I appreciate that you
turned that big mountain

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.388
of paperwork into
a hill, but why?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.390
I'm attached to my
head and Glissela

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.644
would've bitten it clean off
if I hadn't done it, so...

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.896
Lookie here,
our guild's right up there.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.773
C'mon, kid, let's
get this over with.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.066
Okay!

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.442
Huh?

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.570
That building is
the Merchant's Guild?

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.712
The inside is impressive, too.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.255
Do you like what you see?

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.132
It looks the way it
does for a reason.

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.301
Served as a fortress
a long time ago.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.636
You're kidding me!

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.888
Someone thought, "Hey, let's
turn this fortress into

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.223
a Merchant's Guild?"

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.349
Don't be silly.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.518
We use this place
for several guilds!

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.396
So we have the Adventurers,
Dragoons, and Craftsmen,

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.815
and of course, the Merchants
assemble here as well.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.151
It's a four-tress, after all,
so it's fitting to have four!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.487
You said "Dra-goon?"
What is that?

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.240
Oh, yeah. I guess you
wouldn't be in the know.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.117
Take a look out
that window there.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.164
Those things are enormous!

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.542
Never seen so many
big monsters before,

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.252
at least not all in
the same place.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.129
Their size is kind of essential.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.381
Bigger they are,
more goods they carry!

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.216
And, apart from
transporting people,

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.218
that's what the
Dragoons use them for.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.097
The monsters work
for the guild? Ah.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.224
[PIORO] The fastest means
of travel is by way of flying

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.143
monsters, hands down.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.603
But, those critters are what
you'd call "high maintenance,"

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:43.064
and need a certain amount of
space and amenities.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.066
When you think about it
from that perspective,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.653
a fortress is an ideal
facility to care for them.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.155
Makes sense, yeah.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.990
Why share the needed
space and amenities

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.616
with the other guilds, though?

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.619
[PIORO] The guilds of Lenaf
are a team, that's why!

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.997
Members of the Adventurer's
Guild gather raw materials,

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.874
which members of the
Craftsman's Guild transform

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.083
into goods.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.252
Then it's the Merchant
Guild's job to turn a profit

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.920
on those goods,
while the Dragoon's Guild

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.881
is in charge of
transporting them.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.675
That special system is how
Lenaf managed to expand

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.260
over the years.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.845

Amazing.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.472
Yeah, that's one word for it.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.432
Wanna know something
even more amazing?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.601
This whole thing was
thought up by one guy.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.854
And also, that man was like
the trunk of my family tree!

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:23.938
Know what else?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.356
He dubbed this
concept the "airport,"

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.025
and it stuck ever since!

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:27.901
Neat, huh?

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.444
Such a clever idea for a name!

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.488
Uh, he sounds like a genius.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.323
Boy, was he!

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.992
[RYOMA] Or he was somebody
who'd heard the term before

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.077
on Earth.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.998
I was suspicious the instant
I learned his family name

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.918
was Saionji, but the
airport thing seals it.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.171
Mister Pioro's ancestor
was a transfer like me,

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.424
and he definitely left
his mark on this world.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:52.967
[CLERK A]
Thanks for waiting.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.844
[PIORO]
No worries. Ryoma?

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:55.887
Right!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.729
[RYOMA] I can't express how
grateful I am that you set

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.273
all this up for me
from the get-go.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:10.068
Opening my shop should be
a walk in the park now.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.029
Wasn't any sweat off my back,
so don't worry about it, kid.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.406
I mean, after all,
not like Glissela supports

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.325
just anyone, yeah?

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.410
I reckon my hopes for you
should be just as high

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.745
as hers are.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.123
And this is a favor I intend
to cash in on one day

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.874
down the road.
You get me?

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.751
[RYOMA chuckles]
Loud and clear.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.752
[PIORO]
Good deal!

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.879
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine!

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.298
For now, though, let's go
check out your new place.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.383
[RYOMA]
Let's!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.970
[RYOMA]
This is it?

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.597
It sure is.
Looks pretty spiffy, huh?

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:43.935
And, best of all, it's right
across the street from my place,

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.855
so if you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.773
What a great location!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.025
Feel like all I've done since
I met you is thank you,

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.361
but I truly appreciate
the help you've given me.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.905
Didn't I say not to
worry about thanks?

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.657
I'm a business man, Ryoma.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.659
I'll always answer when
opportunity knocks,

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.620
even if it just results
in an IOU at the start.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.373
Well, you didn't come all this
way just to hear about me.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:08.543
Why are we out here, just
standing in the street?

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.379
Let's go inside and
scope out your store!

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.922
--Come on.
--Hey. I can walk!

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.593
[PIORO] The first floor
is the shop area,

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:19.888
while the second floor has rooms
for meetings and whatnot.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.307
The previous owner's house
is on the premises, too,

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.267
so I guess you can use
that as a dormitory

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.645
for the employees if you want.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.730
Wonderful!

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.399
As soon as I build the furniture
to fill this place up with,

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.110
we should be ready
for business, I think!

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.321
I'll contact Gimul immediately
so my people know

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.114
we're good to go!

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.157
Here, Drei!

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.913
[PIORO] Oh!
Nice lookin' limour bird!

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:45.788
[RYOMA]
Thanks.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.665
I tamed a few recently.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.750
[PIORO]
Oh, yeah.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.586
Glissela mentioned
that you were a tamer.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.338
So, on top of your
business skills,

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.548
you're able to tame
limour birds, too.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.471
Get there safe and sound, okay?

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:02.347
Well done.

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.057
Now we just have to
wait for your employees

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.808
to make the journey here.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.353
By the way, you book
an inn for the night yet?

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.688
That a no?

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.899
If so, my doors are open to ya.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.817
Won't charge any money, either.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.362
Can't do better than free,
so whaddaya say?

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.738
Only if you're sure.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.739
[PIORO]
I am!

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.740
Easy call.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.158
I'll see to it you're fed, too.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.117
You will?

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.035
Be honest, kid.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.204
You haven't put a single
decent meal in your belly

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:27.789
since you left Gimul, right?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.208
Um... You guessed it.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.585
One fun fact I learned
on my journey here

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.129
was just how gross
travel food can be.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.467
[PIORO] Talented as you
are, you're still a newbie

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.095
adventurer, so you might not
have realized that the rations

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.430
they sold you were made
to be cheap and durable,

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:45.848
not tasty.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.933
Chin up, though!

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.185
Tonight, I'm gonna serve you
a dinner that's so delicious

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.854
and rare it'll just wipe
away that memory.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.190
Awful tastes and all.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.110
You sound pretty confident,
but what makes it so rare?

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.863
[MIYABI]
Ooh, guess what I heard!

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.824
Go on, guess!

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.787
[PIORO] Yeah, I know I
should be working hard,

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.080
but I'll do that later.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.123
Okay?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:16.004
[RYOMA] Miso soup,
cooked fish and white rice?

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.841
Then you've had these before?

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.343
Here I was thinkin' I'd
surprise you, but of course,

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.886
you're ahead of the game, huh?

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.639
No! I'm totally surprised, sir!

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.559
Did you happen to get this
miso from somewhere nearby?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.603
[PIORO] Yep. Things like miso,
mirin, vinegar, and soy sauce

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.189
are all local commodities.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.524
Did you say soy sauce?

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.735
[MIYABI] Um, please calm
down, Mister Ryoma.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.612
Uh... I'm sorry for
yelling like that.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.531
[PIORO] If you're that
interested, I'll pack some up

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.158
for you before you leave.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.326
Are you serious?

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.618
Can you spare some?

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.870
[MIYABI claps]

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.079
Yes. We can.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.414
Now, stop with the chitchat.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.666
It's dinnertime, so hurry up
and eat this yummy food

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.209
before it gets cold.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.128
Plus, you've been
talking all day.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.797
There's a time to dish
and a time to dine.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.840
Fair enough.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.195
It's delicious!

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.367
So many memories.

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:30.411
Did you live in Dragonewt
village or something?

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.163
I don't see how else
you'd be so nostalgic

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.749
about these flavors
unless you did.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:35.958
Oh, um...

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.418
My grandma would
make this stuff for me

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.379
when I was really little.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.838
That's how.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.007
What'd you get so flustered for?

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.759
No shame in enjoying
what you like.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.219
It's endearing, honestly.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.138
And besides, I'm glad
you have a cute side.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.849
It's way more fitting for
someone your age

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.394
to act insecure and cute!

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.938
As impressive as your
accomplishments are,

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.690
at the end of the day
you're still just a kid.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.692
I'm not all that
impressive, though.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.903
I'm lucky more than
anything, I think.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.364
I kept meeting the right
people at the right time.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.408
That's the real secret
to my success.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:09.867
Well, I beg to differ.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.036
Havin' such a mature outlook
at such a young age

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.038
is impressive in itself.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.040
If only Miyabi would
take a couple pages

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.083
outta your book.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.043
Got some kinda problem, Dad?

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.336
That mouth.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.672
Why can't you use the same
polite tone Ryoma does

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.174
when he speaks to me, huh?

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.051
An attitude like that's
not gonna cut it

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.387
at the royal capital's academy.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.931
Needless to say, I'm a
little concerned for her.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.182
Wait a second.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:35.768
You wanna study at the academy?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.811
[MIYABI]
Yeah.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.729
Great way to make good
connections as a future

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.314
businessperson.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.568
But I doubt I'd be treated well
with how strict they are,

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.946
so I'd honestly rather not go.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.702
[RYOMA]
Gosh. You're that reluctant?

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:00.460
[PIORO] So, what're your plans
from tomorrow onward, Ryoma?

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:01.711
The shop's completely empty,

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.880
so there's lots to
do in preparation.

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:05.882
And, until my staff arrives,
I'll probably look for

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.010
some work as an adventurer
to try and keep myself busy.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.388
Wait, you're telling me
you're an adventurer, too?

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.598
That's right.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:16.100
But I'm just rank E,
which is pretty low.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.060
[PIORO]
Ah, uh-oh.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.314
Rank E is actually
impressive when you take

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.191
your age into account, but--

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.942
Did I say something wrong?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.652
It isn't you.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.529
There just aren't
many E-ranked jobs.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.323
At least, not at the moment.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.240
Why?

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.284
There's this strong monster
prowling the outskirts

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.827
of town.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.622
As of now, no one's able
to assign quick jobs

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.248
that aren't in Lenaf
because of the danger

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.083
that thing poses.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.794
It's bad for the
Merchant's Guild, too.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.381
Ugly brute's disrupting
traffic on our main roads.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.717
[RYOMA]
What kind of "beast" is it?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.095
It's a smash boar,
and it's rank D.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:55.806
It sounds kinda familiar.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:17:00.144
[RYOMA] Where did I hear the
term "smash boar" before?

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.064
Oh, yeah! From the gods!

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.733
Gain and the others
told me about it.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:08.319
For my backstory, we used
names that belonged

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.613
to a deceased couple
as my grandparents.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.448
With their spirits'
blessing, of course.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.784
But I ended up getting
more than a backstory.

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.661
They also said I could
have a few heirlooms

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.287
they'd hidden in their village.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.123
Which was inside the
Great Forest of Schluss,

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:24.085
and if the stories are true,
it's one of the most dangerous

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.837
places in Seilfall because
it's filled with all kinds of

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.422
fierce creatures.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:30.883
But before I went,
the gods suggested I fight

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.885
a few monsters similar
to the ones found

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.679
in the Great Forest to prepare.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.807
And one monster I distinctly
remember them mentioning

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.183
was a smash boar!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.351
[MIYABI]
Mister Ryoma.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.270
Mister Ryoma?

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.729
Is everything okay?

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.398
You got this blank
look in your eyes.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.358
Oh. I'm fine.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.776
Just lost in my thoughts.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.361
'Cause, believe it or not,
I've always wanted

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.113
to take down a smash boar.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.867
What an amazing
coincidence, kid!

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.661
You can slay that beast
for us and then scratch

00:17:58.703 --> 00:17:59.954
it off your wish list!

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.039
Its meat also sells quite
well, so be sure to bring

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.583
its money-making
carcass back to me

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:04.834
when you're done, okay?

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:05.960
[MIYABI]
Uh, Dad?

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.463
Did you forget something?

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.841
Mister Ryoma's a
rank E adventurer.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.634
Could you live with
yourself if he got injured

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:14.510
or worse?

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.762
Well, that's why it
was a joke, obviously!

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:18.848
Don't get upset over
such a minor thing.

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:21.392
You know stress is bad for
the skin, right, sweetbean?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.144
Don't lecture me when
you called joking

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.979
about someone's life minor!

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.356
There are some things one
should never joke about.

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.066
What part was supposed
to be funny?

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:32.612
Little help here, Ryoma?

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:33.904
Anytime!

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.448
Well... I, uh...

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.993
[PIORO]
I have to stay at work today.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.912
Sorry I can't escort
you around again.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.415
Miyabi has no such
obligation, though.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.334
So she'll be watching out
for you in my place.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.460
You can count on me!

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:49.962
[PIORO laughs]
Buh-bye.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:51.881
'Kay, you're the one
calling the shots.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.591
What's on today's agenda?

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:54.884
[RYOMA]
Not too much.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.969
Buying lumber
is my top priority.

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.096
So I can make
furniture for the shop.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.015
Then that's exactly
what we'll do!

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.683
Just leave it to me!

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:05.478
[hammering]

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.651
[PIORO] Oh. Sounds like
he's hard at work.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:14.695
Knock, knock!

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:16.030
How's it going, Ryoma?

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.699
Had a little time to spare,
so I thought I'd say hi.

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.368
Uh... Uh...

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:29.418
[PIORO]
I'm so confused.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.544
Uh...

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:31.587
What's goin' on?

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.547
Talk slow 'n use small words.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:36.384
[MIYABI] I would if I could,
but I'm lost, too.

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.760
Care to explain?

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.887
What are we seeing right now?

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.639
Those are slimes, of course.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.557
[MIYABI, PIORO]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.810
Anyone with eyes could tell
these things are slimes!

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:46.894
Obviously!

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.063
I meant how are they
able to use tools?

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.065
Because I taught them
how and they learned.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.108
[MIYABI, PIORO]
Eh?

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.987
[RYOMA]
And that's a wrap!

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.197
For now, at least.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.824
I wanna check out
the Adventurer's Guild

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.826
before the day's done.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.369
Oh. Gotcha.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.912

Safe travels to you, then.

Keep your guard up!

out there roaming free!

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:13.421
Run away if you see it, okay?

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.383
[RYOMA]
We'll see what happens.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.760
Not like I'm out hunting
the smash boar,

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.888
but I'll defend myself
if it attacks me.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.765
Never mind what rank it is.

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.227
Speaking of ranks,
Miss Miyabi was right about

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.229
the local rank E jobs.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.981
There was hardly anything.

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.442
I was lucky I found even one!

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:37.153
And it's an easy-peasy
herb-gathering request.

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.117
You guys are right.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.327

won't fix 'em.

Happy thoughts!

Now! Let's go find some herbs!

This stash should be enough.

Dear Mister Ryoma,

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:13.397
first, thank you
for continuing to write.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:17.026
Second, congratulations
on starting your new shop!

I was elated upon
reading the news,

I rushed to tell my entire
family all about it!

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.576
They are as happy as I am to
hear your laundry business

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.454
is proving to be so successful.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.457
I hope you're pleased with
your achievements, too.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.959
Your efficiency truly
is impressive!

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.754
It is my sincere wish that this
is only the beginning

Maybe one day,

you'll open a branch in

One last thing.

I'm sure you have a lot
going on, with the growth

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.945
of your business
and exploring Lenaf,

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.155
but please keep
your health in mind.

Though working is good,
overworking is not.

Very true.

I'll be careful, Elia.
