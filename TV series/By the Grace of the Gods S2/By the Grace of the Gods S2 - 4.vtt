[ADVENTURERS yell]

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:15.682
[RYOMA]
The smash boar!

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.780
[RYOMA] Maybe arrows aren't
the way to go with this thing.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.865
Its hide is too thick.

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:33.867
--Run away, kid!
--Don't dillydally!

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.744
You two keep running
and I'll take the boar!

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.465
Um... Thanks.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.259
Yeah, seriously!
You just saved our lives!

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.177
Of course.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.513
Are both of you okay
for the most part?

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.430
Uh-huh.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.517
Made it out with just a few
scratches 'cause you stepped in.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.519
But we're a party of
three and our third

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.104
was severely injured.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.690
So I promise we'll repay
your good deed,

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.609
but right now we really need
to focus on helping her!

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:15.153
In that case, maybe
I should tag along?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.614
Healing magic is kind of
a specialty of mine.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:18.907
[KEN]
You're a healer, too?

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.160
Wow! Meeting you was
an amazing stroke of luck!

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.996
Leaving your big catch
unattended won't do, though.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.500
You wait here and we'll bring
our friend over to you.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.001
That works for me.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.044
[KEN]
Be right back!

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.426
Okay. Dimension Home.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.097
Go ahead and drain
it dry, bloody buddy.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.559
Mister Pioro seemed pretty
earnest when he mentioned

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.185
how well the meat sells.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.319
While I'm at it, I should
have the healing slime

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.696
ready for their friend.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.993
You did that so fast!

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.748
And this thing's size
is nothin' to sneeze at.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.750
You're "A-positive"-ly
awesome, slime!

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.844
[RYOMA] Looks to me like the
boar rammed into her, head-on.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:24.639
Apart from these bad bruises,
she has a few broken bones.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.684
But I should be able to
patch her up, good as new.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.575
Oh. Thank you.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.878
Gosh, you sure managed to
tame an impressive slime.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.046
It's amazing!

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.340
Guess I owe both
of you my life, huh?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.674
We're more than happy to help.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.888
[KEN]
Here, a token of our gratitude.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.808
I know it's not enough,
but it's all we've got on hand.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.142
Well, at least for now.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.520
We have a job to cash
in back at the guild.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.230
We were collecting herbs
when that boar came

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.190
charging at us from
out of nowhere.

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.567
We didn't lose anything
we gathered, though.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.320
Which means our herb-collecting
money is all yours!

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.072
Or I'll just take whatever's
in this pouch,

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.490
and we'll call it even.

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:24.908
Really?

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.285
That's all you want
for saving our lives?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.163
Maybe the rest of your
payment could be as a favor.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.540
It works out, actually.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.458
I can't haul this on my own.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.044
Will you help me
carry it into town?

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.754
Yeah, we'll gladly lend a hand!

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.673
Just tell us where
to drop it off!

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.551
There's one other thing,
if that's okay.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.386
I also saw the job
back at the guild hall

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.846
asking for herbs.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.138
Before the smash boar attacked,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.473
that's what I was
out here doing.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.433
So it'd be very helpful
if you three could act as my

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.270
witnesses and tell the guild
officials I didn't purposely

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.105
hunt it down.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.148
[GROUP gasps]

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.526
Wait! If you were out doing
the same job as us,

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.278
then are you E-rank, too?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.530
Yep. Guess we skipped intros,

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:05.907
but my name's Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.701
And my name is Filly.

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.870
The cute one over
here in blue is Lurie.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.913
And him, his name is Ken.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.456
[RYOMA]
Pleasure to meet you all!

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.710
You know, ranks aside,
smash boars are quite dangerous,

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.587
yet you handled
that one with ease.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.046
I wouldn't say "with ease."

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.173
I'm pretty sure it was
just a lucky punch.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.845
[PIORO]
What?!

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.639
You really killed
the smash boar?

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.141
You heard me when
I said I was just kidding

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.601
about that, right?

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:36.229
[MIYABI] Mister Ryoma,
explain what I'm seeing!

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.856
A smash boar's carcass.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.608
Don't you be smart
with me right now!

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.568
Why am I seeing you beside
a smash boar's carcass

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.987
when we both agreed you
wouldn't go after it, huh?

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.530
"Run away if you see it, okay?"

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.781
Ring any bells for ya?

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.575
[GUILD CLERK]
Uh, excuse me.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:49.951
[MIYABI]
No, you're not excused!

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.704
We're busy, if you
haven't noticed!

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.664
I'm on orders from
the Adventurer's Guild.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.293
There were rumors that
someone carried a smash boar

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.754
into the building,
so they sent me to check on it.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.256
Yeah.
There's no hiding that hide.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.050
[GUILD CLERK]
But no one's claimed the bounty.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.177
As a measure to keep
the lower-ranks safe,

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.846
hunting without a
licensed job is prohibited.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.640
Do you mind telling
me what happened?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.975
We'd know by now
if you hadn't interrupted!

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:16.561
All right, enough stalling!
Explain yourself!

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.356
Well, guys?
Will you fill them in, please?

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.191
[GROUP]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.652
I'm glad I thought
to ask them to testify.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.153
Really glad.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.868
Saving their lives, huh?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.578
All things considered, yeah.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.872
I guess that's a good excuse.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:36.998
It certainly is.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.626
Means no regulations
were violated.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.962
Please take the tusk of the
smash boar back to the guild

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.005
as proof that it's been
slain so you can receive

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.966
your bounty in full.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.259
I'm sorry if I
caused any trouble.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.803
No trouble at all.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.471
Now I can leave
you folks in peace.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.393
The three of us should
take our leave as well.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.062
Unless there's another favor
you'd like to cash in?

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.189
[RYOMA] No, you guys
did more than enough.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.315
It was our pleasure!

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.568
[PIORO]
Anyhoo.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.153
Now that the
excitement's died down,

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.571
let's get into the wet work.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:09.864
Right!

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.076
To confirm, you are willing
to sell 100% of the meat

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.869
to the Saionji Company, yeah?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.121
[RYOMA]
Almost.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.664
It'd be nice if you
could cut a few pieces

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.124
for me as well.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.667
[PIORO]
Wouldn't wanna not be nice!

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:22.168
[knife slicing]

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.462
--[COOK A] What the--?
--[PIORO] Something wrong?

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.839
Look at this slab of meat.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.882
There's not a drop of
blood to be found.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.509
A boar without blood?

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.386
[RYOMA]
Oh, yeah.

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.555
I drained all of it
before I got here.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.515
How did you pull
off a trick like that?

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.767
What, is butchering another
one of your hobbies?

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.602
Believe it or not,
it was a slime!

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.230
One that feeds exclusively
on the blood of animals.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.690
Pretty neat, isn't it?

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.109
Never realized how many
different slimes there are.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.152
[PIORO]
Neither did I!

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.948
Ryoma! Please consider selling
me this astounding slime!

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.907
What?

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.159
Look at this meat! Look!

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.119
Because of your wondrous,
blood-sucking companion,

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.912
this is top-shelf stuff!

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.790
Now, it's super high quality,
and super high quality

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.251
justifies super high prices!

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.378
So, please! Sell me the slime!

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.380
Well you'll run into
all kinds of issues

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.091
without a tamer
around to control it.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.926
And sorry, but I'm
not gonna part with

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.887
the only bloody slime I have.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.431
Just slice it in two and
give me one of the halves!

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.849
I'm okay.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.435
Can you not be weird for,
like, five minutes, Dad?

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.188
Ugh! Don't even know how
embarrassing you are!

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.523
I was joking! Calm down.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.692
[MIYABI] I saw that look on
your face, and it was no joke!

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.115
[RYOMA]
Hey! I'm back from the guild!

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.117
[MIYABI]
Oh! Welcome back, Mister Ryoma!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.703
So? How did it go?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.122
I got paid for the smash
boar, just like he said.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.707
Then, of course,
my herb collection.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.834
So I left with
rewards for two gigs!

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.503
You made out like a
bandit by selling the meat

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.464
last night, too.
Business is really booming!

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.633
Yeah. I suppose it is.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.802
[PIORO]
Hey there, Ryoma.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.929
Your timing's excellent, kid!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.056
There's something
I'd like to ask ya.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.224
[RYOMA]
Go for it.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.351
Ever get tired of
eating the same things?

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.520
Well I do, so I thought
I'd spice it up.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.730
I asked our cooks to invent
something new using

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.233
the smash boar meat,
but the dishes

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.235
they came up with
are really boring.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.654
They kinda just
keep adding salt.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.156
My question, Ryoma, is simple.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:18.284
If you have an idea, will you
cook us a special meal?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.036
Ladies and gentlemen, my dad.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.955
[RYOMA]
It looks exactly like pork,

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.832
so it should taste similar.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.500
In which case...

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.086
I think I have a decent
recipe for this.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.838
Yay! Knew you would!

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.382
Any ingredient we
have is yours to use.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.342
Just don't forget to
make enough for me.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.471
Why do I feel like we're
constantly taking advantage

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.597
of him?

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.891
I can help with
this one, at least.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:43.143
That would be great.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.731
Ingredients are selected.

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.692
Broth is bubbling.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.360
Let's get cooking!

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.903
Ready, Miss Miyabi?

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.989
Just tell me what
to do, and I'll do it.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.449
Then, start by grating
the giger there.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.285
Sure! On it!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.954
[RYOMA] It's funny, though they
may have different names,

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.206
a lot of Seilfall's veggies
are similar to the ones

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.541
found on Earth.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.626
That's why I'm pretty
confident recipes from there

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.546
will taste just as good if
I try to recreate them here.

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.981
The smell alone is
making my mouth water.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.065
Yes, indeedy!

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.735
I can hardly wait!

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:36.905
Looks great!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.656
These dishes of
yours have names?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.617
Ginger por-- oh, excuse me.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.494
Giger smash boar and boar
soup are what they're called.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.163
Dig in while they're still hot.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.582
'Kay. Thank you!

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.755
Only word I have
for that is "yum!"

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.925
[PIORO] Mmm! Such an exquisite
balance of seasonings!

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.803
Don't think I could even
dream up a combo this good!

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.142
That's tasty, too!

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.144
Meat blending together
with all of the veggies

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.979
in nutritious harmony!

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.856
Bet we'd sell more
miso and soy sauce

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:14.651
if word about these
recipes spread!

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:17.278
You hunt, you clean,
and you cook delectable food!

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.998
[RYOMA] It's been so long
since I made ginger pork.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.375
I'm glad it turned out right!

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.294
[SALESMAN A]
Get it while you can!

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.505
Your tastebuds
will thank you later!

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.385
Smells like pork.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:43.388
[SALESMAN A] Come try our latest
dish, smash boar with giger!

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.640
A bold, new taste
for daring individuals.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.434
So bust outta your
bubble and buy up!

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.562
Mister Pioro is quick, but
that's a merchant for ya.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.147
And time is money, after all.

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.695
[CARLA] Wait. You all
came to the second shop?

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.449
[ELIARIA]
Fly, my pretties!

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.576
Carry my feelings
to Mister Ryoma!

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.583
[RYOMA] I think I've got
all the big things I need.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.752
Time to tackle the
smaller stuff, now.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.220
[RYOMA]
Miss Carla!

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.597
Manager!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.142
Thanks a lot for making
such a long trip.

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.145
I take it this building
is our new store?

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.188
[RYOMA] Once I sort out some
finer details, we'll be good

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.231
to go.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:38.401
[CAULKIN] Behold, our new
research institution!

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.278
[TONY]
I am so ready for this!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.488
And I see plenty of
other businesses here.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.699
Great for attracting customers!

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.618
[RYOMA] Yeah. We really
lucked out on the location.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.872
Quick question though,
who are they?

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.249
[CARLA] New hires we got
specifically for the Lenaf

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.917
Bamboo Forest Laundry.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.046
Two are clerks who will
also perform bodyguard work,

00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.422
and one is a chef.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.052
Thank you for lending your
talents to our growing chain.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.803
I'm Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.014
[GROUP]
Very nice to meet you, sir!

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.683
I want your work environment
to be a place you like.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.186
So if something is
uncomfortable or difficult,

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.771
don't hesitate to let me know.

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.773
You can go to Miss Carla, too.

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.900
I doubt our level of
comfort will be a problem

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:21.277
working for this company,
judging from our training

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:22.653
in Gimul.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.448
I just wanna settle
down with a nice job.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.825
My culinary skills may not
be as good as Miss Selma's

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.371
as of right now,
but I intend to change that.

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:34.749
[RYOMA] Thanks for finding such
sincere employees, Miss Carla.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.126
They should be a perfect fit!

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.170
With introductions
out of the way,

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.339
give us a list of things
that still need to be done

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.549
for the shop,
and we'll go from there.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.301
Sounds like a plan!

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.803
It's nearly time.

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.889
We're that much closer to the
opening of our second shop!

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:24.006
[PIORO] They got the new
shop prepped for its opening

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.801
in just three days.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.469
And they managed to
do it with such a small

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.846
headcount, too.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.974
He must've chosen quality
staff over quantity, Dad.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:35.726
It isn't just that.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.437
He's at the center of the work.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.441
He leads by example, so his
work ethic inspires his crew.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.900
What can I say?

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.069
He's a truly talented
businessman.

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.281
[RYOMA] I can't decide
if that took way too long

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:50.241
or went by way too fast.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:53.244
Feels like both,
for some reason.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:56.622
Would've never felt
like this on Earth.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.542
Time there didn't go
by slowly or quickly.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.627
It just passed.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.921
I think I know why, though.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.299
The people who interact
with me in this world

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.342
give meaning to
the flow of time.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.059
The moment we've
been waiting for is here.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.186
Yeah.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.608
Bamboo Forest Laundry
Service's second shop

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.610
is now open for business!

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:30.031
[RYOMA]
Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil,

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.825
you know that other store
I mentioned starting up?

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.785
Well, it's officially
operational!

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.874
It was smooth sailing
from the instant we flipped

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.585
the welcome sign, but I
think that's due in large part

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.754
to my experience
of running the first shop.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.556
And while it may be
too soon to say this,

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:59.644
I can see a handful of customers
becoming regulars already.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.606
Either way, my second branch is
off to a terrific start, Elia!

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:08.152
Great work. You should be proud!

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.988
I honestly couldn't have
asked for a better opening.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.616
I hope you realize this
success is all your own doing,

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.369
'cause I intentionally
tried not to lift a finger.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.163
Now, let's keep this
momentum going tomorrow!

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.581
Right!

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.167
[RYOMA] Thank goodnesss,
my staff is wonderful!

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.835
I feel comfortable
relying on them.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.799
Sorry it's so early, everyone,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.717
but thanks for coming
to send me off.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:34.554
We all wanted to be here
to wish you safe travels, sir.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.973
And everyone came
of their own accord.

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:40.268
Hey, if I were in your shoes,
I'd be heading to Gimul too.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.270
You're leaving your
Lenaf shop in great hands,

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.980
so you're smart to head
home so you can plan

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.189
your next move.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.065
True.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:49.318
This is where gets interesting,
but I'll be rootin' for ya, kid!

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.904
Open a bunch of shops
while the getting's good!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:52.905
And relax.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:56.033
Don't lose a single wink
of sleep over us, okay?

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.077
We're all putting our
best foot forward,

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.830
so our branch'll be
as great as the first!

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.331
You wait and see, sir.

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:04.500
We'll run this shop
smooth as slimes!

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:05.543
Take care!

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.753
Though it's not like
we won't see you again.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.879
Thanks a lot, guys.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.423
I needed to hear that.

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.758
I hope all of you take
care of yourselves, too!

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.594
And remember not to overdo it.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.928
Take your own advice.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.888
Have a break once
in a while, okay?

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.433
I'd rather this meeting
not be our last,

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.268
so don't die or anything.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.271
Yeah. Can't go dying with
so much to do, right?

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.940
My slime studies are
nowhere near complete.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.942
I'm also curious about
those heirlooms,

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.652
so I've gotta live.

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.237
Gotta keep my promise to Elia.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.157
Miss Miyabi?

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.325
What's up?

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.076
[RYOMA] Since you'll be
attending the academy in the

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.663
royal capital later this year,
there's a little favor I'd like

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.789
to ask of you.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:46.626
There's this girl.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.753
Her name is Eliaria, and she'll
be attending that school

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.338
for the first time, too.

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:51.964
I think you'd really like her,

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:54.759
so maybe make it a point
to be nice if you see her?

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.636
Well, guess I don't have
an issue with that

00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:58.137
as long as she's not
hanging with the wrong

00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.305
kind of people.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.015
But I'm pretty sure
this girl's the opposite

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.475
of a bad egg, right?

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.477
You wouldn't have mentioned
her if she weren't!

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:05.353
[RYOMA]
That's true.

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:06.854
Could you also tell her
I said "good luck"

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.814
whenever your paths cross?

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.900
[MIYABI]
Yeah, okay! I can do that.

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.568
But don't give all
your luck away!

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.362
Deal. I'll try, at least.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.202
[RYOMA]
When I get back to Gimul,

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:24.747
I should do some research on
the Great Forest of Schluss.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.165
Though, the only
monster I've fought

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.668
in preparation is
that smash boar.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.795
[BIRD call]

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.048
[ELIARIA]
Dear Mister Ryoma,

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.634
how is life in the new
city treating you?

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.761
I'll be following your lead
and starting a new life

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:42.014
in the capital soon,
so I'm using your letter

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:44.266
as a sort of affirmation
to ready myself

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.602
for the challenge of moving.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.729
I've been putting
almost all of my focus

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.564
on improving my taming magic.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:06.414
The number of slimes
you're able to control

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:09.417
at once is inspiring,
Mister Ryoma.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:12.545
I'll catch up one of these days,
so be on the lookout!

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.760
[SERGE]
A souvenir? You're far too kind.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.555
[RYOMA] These condiments
are really hard to come by.

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:25.182
And what's life without
a little extra flavor?

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.143
Worthless, if you ask me.

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:29.061
Glad you're safely back in town.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.522
Not just because it's good
to have you here in Gimul,

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.442
but so I could receive this
precious gift in person.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.527
Are you planning
a trip of your own?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.695
That's correct.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.989
There's this magic item market
in the town of Keleban

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.742
that I'll be spending
an entire week visiting.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:45.077
Magic items, huh? Cool.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.328
Indeed.

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.540
[RYOMA]
Is this what I think?

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.835
But a toy car in a
world without cars?

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.671
[SERGE] You're looking at a
scale model of a magimobile.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.471
So that thing's
powered by magic?

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.599
As the name implies!

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:14.523
These gears are imbued with a
neutral magic called "Spin."

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:17.067
It makes them spin in a set
direction once a little magic

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.319
is put into them.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.820
They're often used
as power sources,

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.238
among other things.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.867
And you said this magimobile
is a scale model, right?

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.660
Intelligent young man
that you are,

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.871
I'm sure you've guessed it's
a carriage-sized vehicle

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.206
people ride in.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.499
They're also raced for sport,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.958
and there's a large
magimobile event held

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.294
in the capital each year!

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:38.005
I myself am the proud
owner of such a vehicle.

00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:39.215
But from what you've shown me,

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.592
these magimobiles
don't put out much power.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.635
True.

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:45.346
Unfortunately, they aren't
what I would call practical.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:46.972
But they're fun! Right?

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:49.099
[RYOMA]
He seems to be enjoying this.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.726
Though, who doesn't like
when someone listens

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.229
to them talk about
their hobbies?

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.564
[SERGE] Anyway, this model
is just a sample of what

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:58.067
the giant buffet that is
the magic item market

00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.235
has to offer.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.611
For instance...

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.198
You can purchase
all sorts of enchanted

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.783
knick-knacks and doodads.

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:07.451
If they happen to be compatible,

00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.286
you can create new
items without wasting

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.788
your own magic!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.540
Creating new stuff?

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:15.251
You have my attention
and my curiosity.

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:17.378
Can't just fuse anything
together, though.

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:20.089
Like cooking, you need
the right ingredients.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.966
[RYOMA] Which you get from
the magic item market,

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.008
of course!
