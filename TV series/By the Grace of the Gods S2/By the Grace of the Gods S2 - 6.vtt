[SHOPKEEPER A]
Come take a look!

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.890
This self-spinning millstone
makes grinding powder

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.725
practically effortless.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:19.978
Carry over 300 arrows with
this baby's Item Box spell!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.065
'Cause if you need more than
300 to execute a single job,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.317
archery wasn't for you
to begin with!

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.736
[SHOPKEEPER C] Blades
imbued with top-notch magic!

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:29.446
They look as sharp as they cut,

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:31.740
and are sure to
increase work efficiency!

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:37.120
[RYOMA] So this is the
magic item market!

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.169
Hey! Good mornin', Mister Serge.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.505
Same to you, kid.
Nice to see ya.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:47.923
Thanks! Likewise.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.133
Take your time and
look around a little bit.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.053
Yes, eventually, but I do have
a business proposition

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.681
I'd like to discuss in
depth with you first.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.100
Oh? Let's talk it out, then.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.561
May as well get comfy,
so have a seat.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:01.645
[SERGE]
Good call.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.318
Who are you?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.736
[RYOMA]
Who are you?

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.073
[DINOME] This is Fedele, the
grandson I mentioned yesterday.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:17.160
[chuckling]

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.704
Hey there, little guy.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.414
Call me Ryoma, okay?

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.833
Okay! Can we play?

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.585
He seems to have
taken a liking to you,

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.211
so why not indulge
him for the moment

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.754
while we stay here and chat?

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.632
I doubt you'll be
missing out on much.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.092
Sounds good to me.

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:37.055
Ah! Let's play!

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.640
Do you have a game in mind?

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:39.683
Word chain!

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.810
We can start with "M"
for "Magic item!"

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:44.354
[RYOMA]
Um... Myself?

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.024
F, Fedele!

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.068
E, for egg?

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.194
G.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.575
[RYOMA] Thought he'd be
enjoying this a bit more.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:57.618
[FEDELE]
G...

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.538
[RYOMA] He probably wants
to play outside of this stall,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.707
but the odds of him wandering
off and getting lost

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.584
are too high.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.836
G. Glass!

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:10.380
[RYOMA] Doesn't look like
there any toys for him either,

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:12.215
which is a fairly easy fix!

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:17.596
'Scuse me.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.641
If it's okay, may I please
borrow this bucket over here?

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:21.808
[APPRENTICE A]
Go for it.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.478
[FEDELE]
Ryoma, yours is "S."

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.520
For sand.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:30.484
[FEDELE]
D. D is for... doorknob!

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:31.777
I have B?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.700
B for "Beigoma."

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.036
[DINOME] I say you got yourself
a deal and a manufacturer,

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.412
Mister Serge.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:43.914
[SERGE]
Pleasure doing business.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.250
It really is a flawless
little work of art.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.752
Can't wait to make more.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.175
There.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.807
See? Hold it like
this then, whoosh!

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.849
[FEDELE laughs]

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:07.688
Then whoo, uh!

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:08.772
[RYOMA laughs]

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.357
Here. Lemme give it a shot.

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.861
Oh, by the way, Mister
Dinome is now on board.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.571
Thank you for agreeing!

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.989
No sweat!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.409
You aren't the only one getting
a decent piece of the pie,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.077
so it works out for both of us.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.204
There we go.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.667
Wow, you must've played
with beigomas before!

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.211
Nah, I just copied your
movements is all.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.504
Nothin' more to it, kid.

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.630
Huh?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.716
What? Do you think that I just
started being a craftsman

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.592
the other day or something?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.885
Once I see stuff in action,

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.762
it's easy for me
to figure it out.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.431
[FEDELE]
You're awesome, Grandpa!

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:44.266
Am I? Heh.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.600
Nice of you to say!

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.355
You all will make way
better use of these,

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.940
so I'll leave this set here.

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:52.858
You sure?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.026
Yes. So you two
can play together.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.319
Right, Fedele?

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.155
Yeah! Let's play!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.118
All right. Don't hafta twist
my arm anymore.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.244
I'll take 'em.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.166
[RYOMA]
Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil,

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.168
I saw tons of new
and interesting things

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.463
at the magic item
market in Keleban.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.548
But what burns the
brightest in my memory

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.134
are the smiles of Mister
Dinome and his grandson.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.471
They were thoroughly
amused by a toy

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.306
I whipped up with
leftover material

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.266
from the music box I made.

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.351
An unexpected win, in my book.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.497
I'm home.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.379
It's gotten pretty late.
Bedtime for me.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.925
The slime that ate the charcoal.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.220
It's beginning to evolve!

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.851
That was quick.

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.144
Monster Appraisal.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.482
Says it's a deodorant slime.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.942
It's all about odor.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:44.070
Removes. Resists. Absorbs.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.822
So it's still like
a cleaner slime,

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.992
but it specifically centers
its abilities around aromas!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.078
Forget sleep,
it's research time!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.415
[CALLUM] You spent all night
analyzing and came here

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.292
without a wink of sleep?

00:06:57.334 --> 00:07:01.922
Well, yeah.
That's beside the point!

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.382
There's a fluid the
deodorant slime produces.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.551
I've hypothesized
it absorbs odors,

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.094
but I haven't tested it yet.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.181
And this is it?

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.432
[RYOMA]
Yes.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.644
They have cotton dipped in
the liquid for an experiment.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.187
[CALLUM]
Which entails putting these bags

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.606
in different rooms
all over the shop.

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.441
So I can test its limits.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.569
There's no danger since
it's not poisonous.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.905
I've nothing but respect
for your passion, sir.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.448
It's inspirational.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.992
Aw, if you say so.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.161
Anyway, I'm gonna walk
around to see who else

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.288
can lend a hand with
the experiments.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.873
Meeting adjourned.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.375
[CALLUM]
Very well, then.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.002
Although, do make it back
home as soon as possible

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.462
to get some rest.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.630
I'll pencil it in.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.974
Let's make some tasty charcoal.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.101
I'm glad Mister Callum's
looking out for me,

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.603
but I wanna stockpile
a bit of feed before bed.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.024
The more they eat,
the faster they multiply,

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.110
but gotta wait for the
deodorant slime to stabilize

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.611
before its ready to do that.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.372
You guys play together
like that a lot these days.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:18.832
Just havin' a ball.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.090
Know what I just realized?

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.342
The properties of iron and
metal slimes don't change

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.844
even when their shape does.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.225
All right. Let's try something.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:43.857
This could work.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.583
If I explore this
a tiny bit more,

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.002
I bet this could be
one sharp blade!

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.170
What an awesome find!

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.131
More weapons to help me get
through the Great Forest!

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.675
Right! Let's finish up
before morning, guys!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.305
[CALLUM]
Don't tell me.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:17.098
Did you pull
another all-nighter?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.184
No! I took your
suggestion to heart,

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.770
so I made sure I got
a full hour of sleep.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.104
That's all I need.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:27.108
What you need is to put
your health before work.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.235
[RYOMA] Being forced to pull
all-nighters back on Earth

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.322
was the worst, but staying
up to do things I enjoy--

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:34.157
it's so much fun!

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.659
Probably best to keep
that to myself, though.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.953
[MIYA]
Knock, knock, Ryomya!

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.038
Who's there?

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.292
Paw-don the intrusion!

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.044
These smell-cleaning
baggy-thingies

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.338
litter-ally changed my life!
May I have more?

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.672
Oh, I see.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.591
Thanks for helping with the
experiment to begin with,

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.967
Miss Miya.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.719
I take it the effect
wore off, then?

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:55.720
Sadly.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.098
Until this morning, the
stench was totally gone!

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.225
And I added it to the trash
the day before yesterday

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.559
at noon!

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.769
[RYOMA]
Let me examine it.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.442
It appears to have reached its
maximum amount of intake.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.153
They can only absorb
so much stink.

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.571
I'll get you some more, though.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.742
Even throw in a sample of
my new deodorizing solution.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.661
[MIYA] Would putting these in
the same spot as before be

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:20.787
purr-ductive?

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.372
It absolutely would.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.709
I want this project to be
finished as soon as paws-ible,

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.837
so I'll help out any
way that I can!

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.880
I'll keep that in mind.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.590
[MIYA]
You're making hiss-tory!

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.801
This new item will
fur-ever improve the lives

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.719
of cat beastkin everywhere!

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.430
Like, my hopes couldn't
be higher right meow!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.473
Bye!

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.227
[RYOMA] If I keep gathering
data, I should have this stuff

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.104
on the market in no time.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.189
[crash]

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.483
[GIRL A]
Oh, no! The back fell off!

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.860
[GIRL B]
Seems about right.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.111
Jeez.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.571
I can't get any work
done with a cart

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.865
that's as garbage
as the stuff it carries.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.908
But we kinda have to.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.702
Unless you've got money
for a new one.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.036
'Cause I don't.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.080
[RYOMA]
Hello.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.457
What? This look like
a show to you?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.626
Um, may I please fix your cart?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.669
Huh?

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.547
[RYOMA]
Slimes?

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:21.431
[RYOMA]
It should be fine now.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.351
Hang on!
You're not a tamer, are you?

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.352
[RYOMA]
Sure am.

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:30.607
[WIST] Wow. You look about
the same age as us.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.234
Well, you know, we can't all
be in the trash-hauling biz,

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.319
I guess.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.321
It's clearly a job, duh!

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.156
He and I are adventurers.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.658
Yeah. But only rank G.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.493
These three are still too
young to get contracted

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.120
to do any real work yet.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.039
Carting trash to the
disposal facility is worth

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.498
some money, though.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.209
Since we're fellow
slum residents and all,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.129
me 'n' my buddy look after 'em
whenever we get the chance.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.548
[RYOMA] They support
each other to survive.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.176
Okay, why are you looking
at us like that, huh?

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.387
[RYOMA] I was, uh, wondering
if I could ask a favor.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.264
For cash? We're broke.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.766
It's in my Item Box.

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.103
[BECK]
You can use magic, too?

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:16.110
Whoa! I can't smell
the garbage anymore!

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.738
I need help with a current
experiment of mine.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.740
As soon as this bag
stops absorbing the odor,

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.450
will you come let me know?

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.327
[BECK]
Yeah. We can do that.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.496
[WIST]
Um, where will we find you?

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:30.208
Down at Bamboo Forest Laundry
Service. Ask for Ryoma.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.918
It's that building over there.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.503
I'm Beck, by the way.

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.255
I'm Wist. Hi.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.839
We gotta properly thank you.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.259
First you fix our cart,
then you nix that stench!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.760
[RYOMA]
It's fine. Honest.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.136
Aw, screw modesty!

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.430
Just follow me and
I'll hook you up, kid!

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.474
Very tempting.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.059
[FEDELE]
Grandpa is so cool!

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.858
[BECK]
We're supposed to adlib here.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.819
[WIST] I'm bad at that.
Ah, it's over.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:02.448
[RYOMA] So this hookup
of yours is at the church?

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.616
[BECK]
Once every two months,

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.619
they hand out free snacks
if we help clean the place.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.329
And today's that day!

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.789
Ah, I see.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.332
You helped me and my friends,

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.543
so you get free snacks
as a thank-you.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.461
Guess I lucked out, then.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.880
I really should pay it forward
with community service

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.133
activities like this
more often, anyway.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.474
Where am I?

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.315
[FERNOBELIA]
I'm able to summon you as well.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.290
Very nice to meet you.
I'm, uh...

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.791
The latest transfer.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.169
Yes, I've heard a great
deal regarding you,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.171
and the consensus seems
to be that you are quite

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.589
the interesting fellow.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.007
[RYOMA]
Another god.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.717
But I wasn't praying.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.719
Why am I here?

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:08.014
I'm Fernobelia, the noble
god of academics and magic.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.182
This is my realm.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.142
Try to relax while you're here.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.603
You'll be teleported back
exactly where you were

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.396
when the time is right.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.315
[RYOMA]
Thank you for having me.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.775
Tekun mentioned him!

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:22.111
He's the god that's seldom seen
'cause he closes himself off.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.739
He does strike me
as kinda grumpy.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:28.076
[FERNOBELIA] I want to ask
you a few questions. May I?

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:29.160
Sure.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.412
What, pray tell, was your
previous world like,

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:33.247
if you can recall?

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.291
Well, it's difficult to put
what the whole planet

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.169
was like into words,
but I'll give it a try.

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.674
[FERNOBELIA]
All right, next question.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.593
What is your favorite food?

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.969
Food? But what about--?

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:48.513
[FERNOBELIA]
Did you feel loved growing up?

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.516
What is your opinion
on academics?

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.934
Conflict? Romance?

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.399
Uh, shouldn't I answer the first
question before moving on

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.691
to the next one?

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.194
No, thank you for
your cooperation.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.946
Wait.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.240
[FERNOBELIA] Yes, as you
surmised, the moment you reacted

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.242
to my words, your heart
already had the answers

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.619
I sought.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.038
So I read you after each query.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.125
Forgive me, I was
a bit wary of you.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.167
Of me?

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.753
[FERNOBELIA] Let's just say, not
all transfers from Earth

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:24.173
have had your disposition,
unfortunately.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:27.218
Some become corrupted by
power and commit crimes.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.846
Others lose control of their
power and unwittingly

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.889
bring about disaster.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.141
[RYOMA]
Point taken.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.892
I'd wanna study me first, too.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:40.356
[FERNOBELIA]
Thank you.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.400
You seem to sympathize with me.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.235
Though we try our best
not to bring anyone

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:48.322
with clearly dangerous beliefs
to the world we preside over,

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.825
alas, there's no failsafe
to prevent them

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.952
from turning evil later on.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.371
I wish I could tell you
for sure that I won't,

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.081
but as a precaution,
I'll stick to the straight

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.791
and narrow whenever I can.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.835
Those who utter casual
absolutes are among

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.712
the least trustworthy.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.964
I'll take your honesty as
a sign of how serious

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.132
you are about this.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.719
It appears it's time.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.763
One last query,
what is your opinion

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.183
on the world of Seilfall?

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.517
I'm glad I came.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.227
From the bottom of my heart.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:26.068
[BECK]
Hey, why'd you stop?

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.863
What, have you never
mopped before?

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.573
Whoops. Sorry about that.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.241
I didn't let you in
on the secret snacks

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.368
just for you to slack off.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.537
Shape up or you're gonna
make me look bad.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.622
Check your tude, Beck.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.165
We brought him here
as a way to thank him

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.875
for everything he did today.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:41.959
He's fine.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.211
Aren't you, Ryoma?

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.253
Yep.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.841
Though I'd normally have
this done in an instant

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.843
with my scavengers and cleaners.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.303
I can tidy up, too.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.933
Now this is what you
call immaculate.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.061
[BECK] Apart from snacks,
there's actually

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.146
one other perk for helping out.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.189
[RYOMA]
What is it?

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.233
Anybody who wants it
is offered a free lesson

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:07.443
in combat training
after we clean!

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.445
Yeah, they get a member
of the Adventurer's Guild

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:10.988
to come and teach us.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.990
So that one day,
when we're all grown up,

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.825
we can take what we
learned and be able to live

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.035
on our own.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.703
The Adventurer's
Guild does that?

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.163
Wow, that's really cool.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.665
I didn't have any idea.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.708
I know you're a tamer
with magic and stuff,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.710
but if you combine
that with fighting skills,

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.462
you could be an adventurer too!

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.005
Look! He's here!

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.550
Here comes scary-face
man, right on cue!

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:38.140
Hey. Did I just hear one of
you call my face scary?

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:39.725
Aw, that's not very nice.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.018
[RYOMA]
Mister Worgan?

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.062
Well, if it isn't Ryoma!

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.480
What brings you to the church?

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.190
Going with the flow today.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.692
That a fact?

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.360
Guess fate's on my side.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.987
Since you're here,
you wanna lend a hand?

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.446
Okay.

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:55.366
Why're you and the guild master,
like, best buds anyway?

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.035
Well, he's helped me
out in the past.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:01.247
[WIST] Hang on, then does
that mean what I think?

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.206
Oh.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.750
You must've just met
the boy wonder.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.128
He's an 11-year-old
rank-E adventurer.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:10.423
[gasping]

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.049
[WORGAN]
Now, let's begin!

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.346
Hey! Don't rely on
brute force alone!

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:19.265
When fighting monsters,
you gotta keep an eye out

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.684
for any openings to
strike at weak points!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.065
[RYOMA] Though Wist
isn't scoring any hits,

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.483
he's super strong.

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.819
I can't believe we're
around the same age.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.533
Beck! Let's see what ya got!

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.160
[BECK yells]

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.832
You're mine!

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.042
Seriously?

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.294
[BECK grunts]

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.088
You're very easy to
read when you jump

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.007
because you can't
change your trajectory.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.593
How many times do
I have to say it, kid?

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.846
Strike from my blind spots
and maybe you'll land a hit.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.390
[RYOMA] He's really athletic
and nimble, though.

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.476
[WORGAN]
Ryoma, how's your bunch?

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:04.644
They're doing well.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.191
[RYOMA] I told my slimes
to just dodge attacks

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.109
and counter with
some light bumps.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.070
The worst they'll do is
leave a few scratches,

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.113
but I've got healing
slimes on me, too.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.865
Couldn't've asked for
better sparring partners

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.075
for those little kids.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.117
Well done.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.786
Now it's time for your training.

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.037
Me?

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.790
[WORGAN] Though you used a bow
at your combat ability test,

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.583
don't you also use swords?

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.461
Let's go!

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:38.886
Incredible.

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:41.972
What in the world?

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.641
Just who is that kid?

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.310
[RYOMA] Thanks for teaching
me about the secret snacks

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:48.062
you get for cleaning
up the church.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.648
Thank you!
You are so cool, Ryoma!

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.526
And we're gonna try our absolute
best to be adventurers

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.194
as great as you!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.320
Bye for now!

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.864
I'll drop by when I know
how that smell test went.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.783
Thanks! Every update counts!

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.161
[WORGAN]
Good work.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.831
Would you like to refresh
yourself with some tea?

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:07.998
[RYOMA]
Yes, please.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.878
Ryoma, what do you think about
becoming an instructor

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.755
at the Adventurer's Guild?

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:15.840
What?

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.384
Not only do you have the
skill and patience for it--

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.302
Today, your slimes proved
to be quite helpful

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:21.846
in training low-ranked rookies!

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.180
I'd rather not right now.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:25.349
My plate's a little too full.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.851
Plus, I'd need to study it.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.395
Can't teach if you aren't
taught in the first place.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.689
You never change.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.566
[RYOMA]
My image of you sure does.

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:36.569
Who would've guessed
you train kids in combat?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.821
It's honestly the
least I could do.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.698
You'd think it'd take
an army to run this place,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.116
but it's just two nuns.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.451
[RYOMA]
No. Really?

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.161
Yes, but it's okay.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.662
We don't have to manage alone.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.497
Lots of people in town pitch in.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.167
Mister Worgan is just one of
many adults who help out.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.002
[WORGAN]
Kids also pitch in, as you saw.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.796
And today, you happen to
be one of those helpers.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.257
Thanks for doing your
part for the community.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.925
Did I really help?

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.927
You think?

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:04.263
[RYOMA] After all the
support I've received,

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:09.310
I'm in a position where
I can selflessly give back.

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.687
Even though I don't
get anything out of it.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:16.066
I can be like them and help
people the way they helped me.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.986
Gotta say, I like this feeling!

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.905
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.364
Best feeling in the world.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.340
[ELIARIA]
Guess what, Mister Ryoma!

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.842
I'm studying how to bake and
decorate cakes right now!

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.263
It's practice for when
I go to the academy.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.224
I want to surprise my new
friends with something

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.476
that's hopefully as
sweet as they are.

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:55.231
Having a tea party with
treats you make yourself

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.483
is a great way to show
your guests you care

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.235
and strengthen
those friendships.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.070
Wouldn't you agree?

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:03.113
I might bake these
cakes regularly,

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.659
depending on how
well they turn out.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.703
And, maybe one day,
Mister Ryoma can eat some, too!

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.044
[RYOMA] Sounds like you're
really enjoying life, Elia.

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.715
You've definitely
got the right idea.
