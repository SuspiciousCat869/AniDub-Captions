WEBVTT

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:12.971
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.681
A cleaner slime ate charcoal?

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.642
Are you serious right now?

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.809
Afraid so.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.353
I'm sorry to spring that
on you when you only

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.729
just returned.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.273
Not what you wanted
to hear, I'm sure.

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.526
Back when you placed some
charcoal in the kitchen,

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.778
you mentioned that it
had positive effects,

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.948
such as cleaning the air
and decreasing humidity.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.074
[RYOMA]
Uh-huh.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.992
So, we put some
in the laundry room.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.245
Figured why not spread
those benefits around?

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.664
If we all get cleaner air,
the slimes should too.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.041
[RYOMA]
Then one ate their air purifier.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.252
Right.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.587
Miss Maria noticed it gradually
started eating less

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.840
laundry grime after charcoal
was introduced to its diet.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.385
That's what's concerning.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.719
Raises an eyebrow, yeah.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.845
Apologies.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.806
You left me in charge
in your absence.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.349
The blame is mine alone.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.559
Oh, don't worry.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.394
We don't have to play
the blame game.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.604
Actually, I'm grateful,
if anything,

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.815
since this is something that
could've gone unnoticed,

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.149
but didn't.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.236
It's fine. A natural part
of slime taming,

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:11.196
'cause that cleaner
slime's about to evolve!

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.490
It's evolving? Are you certain?

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:14.449
[RYOMA]
Yes!

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.369
Slimes often gain new
abilities and dietary habits

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.246
during their evolution process.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:21.331
I'll take care of that
little guy for now,

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.834
but please let me know if
you see any other slimes

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.377
behaving strangely.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.588
Sure!
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.965
I also may start logging
everything they eat.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.931
[ELIARIA] Dear Mister Ryoma,
always so nice to hear from you.

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.809
A cleaner slime is evolving
into something else?

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.478
What a surprising development!

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.481
I wonder what kind of abilities
this new slime will have.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.984
Be sure to let me know once it
finally makes the transition!

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.364
That story about the magic item
market was intriguing as well.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.492
I've never been myself,
so if you do end up going,

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.162
please write to me
about your experience.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.581
I look forward to that
particular letter!

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.042
Until then, stay busy
and brilliant!

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.588
Well, you aren't
the only one, Elia.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.174
I'm intrigued by
the market, too.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.760
But I've got obligations,
so what can I do?

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.948
[CALLUM]
You asked to see me, Manager?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.991
Yes, I did.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.993
I'd like to discuss something
that's more personal

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.578
than business related.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.329
Well, that would be a first.

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.706
Please, continue.

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:11.460
I'm thinking I should pay
my hometown a little visit.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503
I left some family
heirlooms behind.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.672
They belonged to
my grandparents.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.841
So, in order to
prepare for the trip,

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.218
I want to focus more on
my adventuring work.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.263
Meaning, I'll be needing
someone to pick up the slack.

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:24.556
Ah, I get it.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.891
Adventure away, sir.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.268
I'll keep the shop
in tiptop shape.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.770
Though, I'm curious.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.688
What part of the world
do you call home?

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.107
And what must be done
in order to prepare?

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.442
I gotta level up.

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:38.236
Not easy gettin' through
the Great Forest of Schluss.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.656
Umm, your whole face melted
in the blink of an eye.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.825
Oh. I hope I didn't offend you.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.119
Guess I was thrown
for a bit of a loop.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.997
Manager, how in the
world are you still alive?

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.792
[RYOMA] The Great Forest does
have a certain reputation, huh.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.293
[CALLUM] They say that
the only thing as dense

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:56.046
as its undergrowth is
its monster population.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.965
It's one of the most dangerous
places in all of Seilfall.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.759
The fact I'm sitting here
with you is nothing short

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.177
of a miracle.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.679
[chuckles] That's why I don't
intend to head back

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.723
until my Adventurer's Guild
rank is high enough

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.600
to consider me qualified.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.352
Who knows how long
it'll be before I actually

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.270
make my way out there.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.272
Something tells me
you won't budge on this,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.817
so I won't try to argue.

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:19.152
But please, do everything
within your power

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.988
to prepare yourself
as well as possible, sir.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.032
Right. Always been the plan.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:24.991
Honestly!

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.618
That's why my next
stop's the guild.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.995
Gonna discuss this
with them as well!

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.498
You said you were okay with
taking care of the shop.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.584
Would you still be okay with
it if that starts right now?

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.127
[CALLUM]
Yes, of course.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.420
Best of luck to you, sir.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.889
Hm? Ryoma!

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.182
What a surprise.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.433
Come to scope out jobs?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.476
Yep.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.815
Both of my laundry shops
are running smoothly,

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.859
so I figured it'd be an
optimal time to focus more

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.068
on adventure work.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.027
Excellent!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.821
Glad things are going so well!

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.031
Now, as for what
we can offer you...

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.575
[RYOMA]
Before I look at jobs,

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.618
there's something
I'd like to discuss.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.579
If you're not too busy, that is.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.830
Let's hear it, then.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.373
I'm never too busy for you.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.709
[PAENA]
I-I said no!

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.751
[ADVENTURER A]
Come on.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.045
--One little ol' drink...
--Oh, dear.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.089
Hold that thought, okay?

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.133
[ADVENTURER A]
So whaddya say?

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.510
All right, guys.
Leave her alone.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.012
Bear in mind she's on the clock.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.972
Oh, hey!
How goes, Miss Maylene?

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.390
Sorry about that.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.767
I wasn't trying to
overstep any lines.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.730
This is a workplace, gentlemen,
not an all-you-can-chat cafÃ©.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.231
If you have jobs, do them!

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.274
Right.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.660
Is there some kind of problem?

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.121
Mm-hmm. Nothing big, though.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.540
First, allow me
to introduce you.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.208
She started just last week.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.960
Goes by the lovely name Paena.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.462
Um! Yes, that's me!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.130
Nice to make your acquaintance!

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.924
Thanks, nice to make yours, too.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.593
Name's Ryoma. Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.803
As for the
aforementioned problem,

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:12.390
Paena's what you might
call a bit of a pushover.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.892
Harsh, but true.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.894
But with time,
she'll overcome it.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.104
Experience often
improves confidence!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.149
So could you address your
issue with Paena instead?

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.735
I'll be there to supervise,
of course.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.820
That's fine.
We all start out somewhere.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.619
[PAENA]
R-Right.

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:35.705
So, we shall assist
you however we can.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.792
Well, about my work
here going forward.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.544
I have a specific goal
for myself in mind:

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.922
leveling up from
rank E to rank C.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.549
Though it won't be quick,
it can't be too slow.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:47.676
If it helps...

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.681
I made a list of the monsters
I'm aiming to slay

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.474
on future jobs.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.976
[PAENA]
Let me take a look.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.479
Calif monkeys and
mad salamanders,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.106
as well as treants.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.275
You know that some
of these aren't suited

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.736
for E-rank members, right?

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:10.991
[RYOMA] Yeah. That's why I won't
take em on till I raise my rank.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.909
I mainly gave you that
list so I could at least

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.911
get information on them
in the meantime.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:17.789
You do that, right?

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.541
Keep records on all
different kinds of monsters

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.917
and environments?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.085
We do!

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.920
What exactly would
you like to know?

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.630
That is the question.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.049
I think learning basic things
like biology and habitat

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.261
are a must, based on
whatever's most up to date.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.679
Right. We can do that for you.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:33.763
Oh, and, um--

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.683
I wanna know more about
the Great Forest of Schluss.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:39.894
Give me anything you have
on monsters in that area.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.396
Why?

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.732
Don't tell me,
is that your goal?

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.900
To one day fight your way
through that deathtrap?

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.697
Yeah, and here's why.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:58.955
[MAYLENE]
I see.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:02.751
Your grandparents' heirlooms
must be quite precious.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.461
I'm sorry, Ryoma.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.754
I shouldn't have questioned
you without learning

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.422
your reasons first.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.716
And since you're willing to take
the necessary precautions

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.301
before you head out,
we have no right

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.053
to prevent you from going.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.679
Just be careful.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.806
Don't you worry, I will be.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.391
You remember what I taught you?

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.268
About drafting contracts?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.353
[PAENA]
Yes. Of course!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.772
[MAYLENE]
I've known you for a while now,

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.441
but I had no idea you
grew up in that forest.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.984
Kinda hard to bring up.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.152
So you know Schluss?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:33.073
Mm-hmm. Only because
of my job, but yes.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:36.034
And, well, it does
explain a few things.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.452
[RYOMA]
What do you mean?

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.996
I mean how your
abilities are so high.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.915
You're far too capable
compared to other kids

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.374
around your age.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.168
But then, if you grew up
in the Great Forest

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.713
of Schluss, you'd have
to be that skilled.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.340
[PAENA]
Thank you for waiting!

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:51.341
That was quick!

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:54.344
Miss Maylene, will you
make sure I did it right?

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:55.386
Yes.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.349
Looks just fine to me.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.184
Better to be safe than sorry.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.228
Here's your contract,
Mister Ryoma.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.105
Please take a brief
moment to look it over

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.440
and sign if everything
is in order.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:10.276
Well, Miss Paena,
we have ourselves a deal.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.951
There you are.
Should be good to go.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.912
[PAENA] Pleasure doing
business with you, sir!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.790
Here. It's your proof
of the exchange.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.959
You'll need to show this when
receiving the documents,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.252
so I'd try not to lose it.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.256
[RYOMA]
Better heed that advice.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.590
Into the Item Box.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.555
[MAYLENE] That takes care
of your first order of business.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.056
Did you want to accept a job?

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.808
No pressure or anything.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.893
Though, if you did
take on a job or two,

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.729
you would certainly be helping
out the Adventurer's Guild.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.106
Sure, I don't mind.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.733
It can even be a little
tougher than I'm used to.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.069
Something with the potential
to raise my rank faster

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.446
without demanding
much time would be ideal.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.615
[MAYLENE] A short-term job
that might enable you

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.784
to climb the ranks quickly.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.870
Ooh! In that case...

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.079
[RYOMA]
Speaking of quick!

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:06.249
I very much appreciate
your patience.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:09.043
D-Do you think this job
might meet your criteria?

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.881
Well, let's see here.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.507
Delivery for a parcel?

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.010
Destination:
the town of Keleban.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.096
That's weird, the time limit
just says "as soon as possible."

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.973
Um... That's correct.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.933
They had a whole
carriageful of wares,

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.561
but set out before realizing
they forgot something.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.189
So, really they hope to
get it by noon the day

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.356
after tomorrow.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.108
The day after tomorrow?

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.319
Why make such an
unfeasible request?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.821
Well it's quicker than waiting
for another carriage,

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.157
and they aren't docking
pay for delays.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:43.995
Earlier I noticed you were,
um, using space magic.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.373
So I, uh, thought maybe you
could make it there on time?

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.127
Too presumptuous?

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.128
Not at all!

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.047
As far as I'm concerned,
you've done everything right

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.673
from the moment we sat down.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.925
It wasn't a fluke.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.052
She always goes above
and beyond like this.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.887
I don't understand
why she acts so timidly

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.889
when she should
be nothing but sure!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.140
I'm so sorry.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.058
[RYOMA]
Don't be.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.810
You brought me a job
I can't help but accept!

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.688
Oh? Thanks for being
up to the task!

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.773
[RYOMA]
Keleban.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.858
That's the town where
Mister Serge said the magic

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.819
item market is being held.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.781
I wanted to go anyway,
so maybe this is a sign!

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:25.995
[PAENA]
I'm happy. I'm timid. I'm Paena.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.793
[MAYLENE] I could have told a
great story if I had 30 seconds,

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.211
but I only have five.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.969
[GATEKEEPER]
Greetings! Welcome to Keleban.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.387
[RYOMA]
Thank you very much, sir.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.432
Can't believe how crowded it is!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.227
Well, tomorrow is the
first day of a market.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.105
A magic items market,
if you didn't know.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.023
[RYOMA] The way you said that
makes it sound like there are

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.150
other types of markets.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.110
[GATEKEEPER]
There are!

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.237
We hold six different
ones a year!

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.572
Central square is gonna
be packed with food stalls

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.242
and people participating
in the event!

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.744
[RYOMA] I get the feeling
I'm gonna enjoy this trip.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.420
Dinome's Magic Item Workshop.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.963
This is it!

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.381
Break out the Item Box!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.928
Hey, anybody home?

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.020
Sorry to intrude!

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.397
Door was open,
so I let myself in!

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.482
[DINOME]
Yeah, that's kinda how it works.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.654
What's a little kid
like you doin' here?

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.906
I'm on official Adventurer's
Guild business.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.491
Got a package addressed to you.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.412
Just sign here, please.
Then it's yours.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.748
Wow! I thought it would
be late, for sure!

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.709
Well, I'll be a calif
monkey's great uncle!

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.794
Much obliged, young man.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.463
Always happy to be of service.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.467
Thank you, I'll excuse myself.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.260
[DINOME]
Before you go...

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.304
You came all the way
from Gimul, right?

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.181
Stay for some tea
if you aren't in a hurry.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.184
Here.

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:12.310
[RYOMA]
'Preciate it.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.522
Wait a second.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:20.568
This tastes more like
coffee than it does tea.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.487
This is delicious, sir.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.030
What kind of tea is it, though?

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.366
The kind made from the
root of a dante flower.

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:28.409
It's supposedly
excellent for your health.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:33.247
[RYOMA] If dante is derived
from Dandelion coffee,

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.958
then this is another
Earth-inspired commodity.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.339
[RYOMA]
That hit the spot.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.673
[DINOME]
Good.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.550
Thanks again for
the package, son.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.719
[RYOMA]
You're very welcome.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.305
Ah! Well, look
who's finally here!

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.015
Come on in, Mister Serge!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.767
Huh?

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.394
Why, Mister Ryoma!

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:55.937
[RYOMA]
Wow, what're the odds?

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.397
Now hold on a second.

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.899
Do the two of you
already know each other?

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:00.817
Uh-huh!

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.028
He's supported me in several
ways since moving to Gimul.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.196
That's backwards.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.282
In truth, Gimul's the one
that gets support from him.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.951
I thought I might
see you around,

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:11.369
just not at Dinome's shop.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.538
Well, I was doing
an adventuring job,

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.124
but what brings you
to this particular store?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:18.793
Wanted to pop in and say hello
before the market began,

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.628
since this is one of the
magic item workshops

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.629
I frequent.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.673
Bumping into you
was a bonus, though.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:25.842
Yeah. Great timing!

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.927
But where have my manners gone?

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.681
Sincere apologies, I've yet to
properly greet you, haven't I?

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:34.684
Nah, I was just having
fun listening to you.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.769
If you have Mister Serge's
seal of approval,

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.771
I should get to know
you better, too.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.857
You can call me Dinome, kid.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:42.525
[RYOMA]
Nice to meet you, Mister Dinome.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.528
I'm Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.406
Got a little somethin' to
show you in the back room.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.158
Invitation's open
to you as well.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.785
That's if magic item
stuff interests you.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.328
Are you sure?

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.371
Well, yeah!

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.249
[RYOMA]
Whoa!

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.126
You have permission to
poke your head around.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.253
All I ask is you
not touch anything.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.630
This way, Mister Serge.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.007
[SERGE]
Coming!

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:09.469
So this is the latest and
greatest magimobile.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.387
Though it looks the same
on the outside,

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.347
I improved the engine and
lightened the chassis.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.807
[SERGE]
Oh ho ho!

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.517
[RYOMA] Always nice to find
someone who shares

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:17.852
a hobby with you.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.646
I should stay out of it if
they're gonna talk shop.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.901
Mister Dinome?

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:28.029
Is this thing over here
considered a magic item, too?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.363
Huh?

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.616
Nuh-uh, nothing
magical about it.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.868
Just your everyday carriage.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.453
It's only in here 'cause
a neighbor of mine

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.038
asked me to repair it.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.873
I'm astonished you agreed.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.833
The Dinome I know
turns down any job

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.002
that isn't related
to magical items.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.047
While you aren't wrong,
things change.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.050
My grandson,
he kinda needs money,

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.135
so I take what I can get.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.136
How touching.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.388
You wish to buy your
grandson a gift, yes?

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.724
Well, perhaps I can
assist you in some way.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.393
I would love to contribute
to a cause so noble!

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.771
Well, it's not a tangible gift.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.648
I wanna send him to the academy.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.442
So I've scrimped and saved
everything I can for tuition.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.110
--Oh, for tuition?
--For tuition?

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.695
To the capital's school?

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:12.573
Uh-huh!
I think he might be a genius!

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.701
Anytime the kid overhears me
and the fellas talk about work--

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.995
[RYOMA]
Heh, doting granddad alert.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:20.414
Here, give this little
doohickey a gander!

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.374
Ta-da!

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.959
[RYOMA] Your grandson
made this from scratch?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.335
[DINOME]
He sure did!

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.795
Isn't it one of the
greatest contraptions

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.171
you've ever laid eyes on?

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.632
What had you accomplished when
you were four years old?

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.759
Not that I can sell this,
but you get it!

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.846
I think he took a liking to you.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.848
Having a mutual friend helped.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.976
Um, by the way,
whaddaya think I should do

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.894
with this thing?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:45.523
Couldn't turn it down,
given how the conversation went.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.900
You're a talented youngster,
so of course you get it!

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.569
I knew I liked you
from the beginning!

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.238
Why don't you take my grandson's
first creation? For luck!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.115
[RYOMA]
Thank you, sir, I'm honored.

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.825
Keep it as a token of
your new friendship

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.159
with Mister Dinome.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.786
If you try to return it,

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:02.582
I fear you'll disappoint
him and wound his pride.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.208
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.294
[SERGE] What are your plans
for the rest of the day?

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:07.545
Any more jobs?

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.379
That was it.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.214
I'm not ready to head
home yet, though.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.300
I wanna stay for the market,
so reserving a room

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.760
at an inn somewhere
is next on my to-do list.

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:15.845
Oh, perfect!

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.722
I can show you the inn I'm
staying at for the duration

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.640
of my visit, if you'd like.

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.183
I'd also be willing
to escort you around

00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:22.643
the market tomorrow.

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:23.978
Wow! Honestly?

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.855
Sure. It would be my pleasure.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:29.233
Thanks a lot, Mister Serge.
I would love that.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.193
I also like the idea
of staying at your inn.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.781
[SERGE]
I'll let you get settled.

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:37.908
I have places to be
and people to see,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.118
but I'll be back.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.620
Nothing's scheduled
for dinner, though,

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.622
so I'd be happy
to dine with you.

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.790
Yeah! Me, too!

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:47.418
[CROWD chattering]

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.919
Okay. What to do now?

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.548
I can't really leave when
I don't know what time

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.550
Mister Serge will
be back, can I?

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.974
Maybe I can try and make
something with this.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.490
Oh. Good, you're here.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.950
I wasn't expecting you
so soon, Mister Serge!

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:21.535
I'm sure you're hungry,
so gimme just a second

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.162
and I'll be right there!

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:26.248
[CROWD laughing, chattering]

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.875
[RYOMA]
This place is popular.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.628
Indeed. This is the night
before a big market.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.505
Every tavern in town is packed.

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.548
What I find curious is
what you were working on

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.966
when I knocked at your door.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.386
I've a feeling it was
a magic item of sorts.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.512
You saw it, huh?

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.222
Boy, you've got a good eye.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.390
Ha, I knew it!

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.850
Let me sneak a peek at this
new passion project of yours.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.686
If you don't mind, of course.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.938
Sure.
Don't mind in the slightest.

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.650
[SERGE]
A box?

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.902
[RYOMA]
A music box.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.113
[music playing]

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.699
As the name suggests,
it plays little tunes.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.284
More of a whimsical
toy than a useful tool.

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.537
[music playing]

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.122
You like it?

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.791
Yes! It's truly fascinating!

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.335
I've never seen such
a trinket in all my years.

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.253
Really?

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.380
There must be
something similar, no?

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.548
[SERGE]
No.

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:18.259
Many musical instruments
are also magic items,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.680
but this is the first I've seen
that plays its own melody.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.057
Mister Ryoma, you
mentioned it's more along

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.143
the lines of a toy,
but there are many nobles

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:30.563
and collectors who take delight
in such frivolous little things.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.148
Put some effort into
its appearance,

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:34.525
and I see it selling quite well.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.695
Not bringing this bright idea
to fruition would be a waste.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:40.948
Um, I truly appreciate
the endorsement,

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.533
but I've got a laundry
business to run

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.452
and adventuring jobs to do.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.620
I don't have the time
to commit to this.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.664
Not alone, no.
But what about...

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.958
[WAITRESS A] Thank you
for waiting, gentlemen!

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.543
We've got two
sizzling hot steaks,

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:53.919
drizzled with herb butter,

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.588
fresh off the grill
just for you!

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.508
[RYOMA] Let's save that
discussion for later.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.760
[SERGE]
Good thinking!

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.471
[RYOMA]
Thank you for the meal.

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.014
[SERGE] Thank you for
making another item

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:07.475
that's as interesting
as it is promising.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.934
I know you're busy,
but if you think

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.395
these music boxes have
potential, like I do,

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.606
then you could commission
someone to make them.

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.776
That's true.
They could be a big hit.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.361
But I have no idea
who I would hire.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.114
Luckily, you have me
for suggestions, yes?

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.783
And my top pick for
that would have to be

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:24.950
Mister Dinome.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.702
Especially considering
how well you two

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:28.162
hit it off today.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:32.416
Hmm. His plate seems a little
too full for another burden.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:35.127
He has the skill and knowledge
needed to craft magic items

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:38.297
like your music box, plus three
apprentices beneath him.

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:39.924
And why would he turn
down the opportunity

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.760
to put money in his
grandson's tuition fund?

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.054
You heard him say as
much with your own ears,

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.473
so I'm sure he would
appreciate any job offers

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.850
at the moment.

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.894
I have plans to meet
up with Mister Dinome

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.521
at tomorrow's market
and would be happy

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.898
to bring it up to him
if you'd like me to.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.149
What do you think?

00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:59.360
[RYOMA]
I think we should go for it.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.029
[music box playing]

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:04.532
Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil,

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:07.618
I'm currently writing you from
a place called Keleban.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.912
Have you heard of it?

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:11.539
The magic item
market I mentioned

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.542
in my previous letter
is being held here

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:17.211
and everything
kicks off tomorrow!

00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:20.631
I wonder what wondrous
things I'll manage to find.

00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.842
I'll be sure to keep
you posted on that.
