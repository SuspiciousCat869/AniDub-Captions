WEBVTT

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.202
This is great!

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.246
The Foundation
Festival's finally here!

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.391
[RYOMA]
Happy festival day!

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.894
Love your stall's theme!

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.145
[ASAGI]
Thanks, Ryoma.

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:26.688
[MIYA]
Meow you doin'?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.023
[RYOMA]
Ready to kick things off?

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.983
We're fur-sure ready!

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.027
It's exciting to think that,
in mere moments,

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.987
we'll be the cause
of people's smiles.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.657
Well just hearing that
makes me smile.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:37.908
Aren't mew sweet!

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.035
May your day be as
exceptional as you are.

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:41.119
[RYOMA]
Likewise!

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.466
[music playing]

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:56.218
Wait, that music...

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.018
You're too kind.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.645
We, the Semroid Troupe,
will be performing

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.689
that very piece
on stage tonight!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.732
And if you enjoyed it so
much you wish you could

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.442
listen it to it
whenever you liked,

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.486
then today's your lucky day!

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:17.072
For this music box
plays it note for note!

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.533
[music playing]

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.411
Take the sounds of the Semroid
Troupe everywhere you go!

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.831
Hi, Mister Serge.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.290
Morning going well?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.292
Yes indeed, very well.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.837
People already love
your music box.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.464
[RYOMA] It helps to have
awesome advertising.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.967
I'm really indebted
to the Semroid Troupe.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.094
And back at Keleban,
Dinome's Workshop

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.971
is mass-producing even more.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.181
I spoke with Master Dinome
and we agreed to widen

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.599
the sales network soon.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.564
Memories are being made today.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.984
Those little souvenirs
preserve them all the better.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.026
[RYOMA]
That's true.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.533
Words can't describe
how happy I feel.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.076
The crowd's already huge!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.746
Hi, I can take whoever's next!

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.957
I'd like one semesa
pastry and that grain tea.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.542
Most excellent selections.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.921
Here, order up.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.090
Ah, much obliged.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.300
Here you are, ma'am.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.052
Mister Dolce!

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.556
[DOLCE]
Is something the matter, sir?

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.893
The lines are kinda long.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.811
Will you come help
manage them, please?

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:33.148
Certainly. Business
must be going well.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.233
[RYOMA] Yep. People are
enjoying our unique options

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.735
as much as we'd hoped!

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.236
Sensational news.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.863
Just leave the traffic to me.

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.615
Appreciate all the help.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.824
[JANE]
Hey, boss!

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.868
Could you ask Miss Selma
for some more stir-fry

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.620
when you get a second, please?

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.538
[JANE] We're also running
low on grain tea.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.582
Will you let Fina know?

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.833
Sure, I've got you.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.007
Wash 'em good!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.259
I'm coming through!

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.636
My bad. Sorry.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.138
[laughs]
We're too busy for accidents!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.019
[RYOMA] Could you cook up
more stir-fry, Miss Selma?

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.187
They're almost out.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.899
I had a feeling it'd sell fast,
so I'm already working on it.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.818
Thanks a lot for planning ahead.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.861
Oh, we're also low on tea.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.823
Could you brew another
pot or two, Miss Fina?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.075
I certainly can!

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.119
Manager!
Look at this thing go!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.705
It shreds veggies
and the work time!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.124
Glad to see this tool is
working so well for you!

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.836
And to think it's really
made of slimes!

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.379
Speaking of slimes.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.714
Hey, guys!

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.010
If you're hungry,
raise your slarm!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.811
[WORGAN] Surprised you
find time to breathe, kid.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.480
[RYOMA]
Mister Worgan!

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.191
Even got Beck
working his tail off.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:02.153
We're all working hard because
we're glad we got hired.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.114
Doing a great job just shows it!

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.199
They really have
been a big help.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.493
Assisted with the prep
before the festival, too.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.455
No.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.332
They've been working non-stop.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.961
They haven't had a single chance
to enjoy the festival yet!

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.379
Since you're here,
Mister Worgan,

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.047
could you please show
Beck and the other kids

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.716
around the festival?

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.551
Guess I don't see why not.

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:26.052
You hit your head or something?

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.096
We can't just abandon our posts
with a neverending crowd

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.140
of customers swarming our stall!

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.183
[CARLA] You could if we
picked up the slack, right?

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.269
[RYOMA]
No way!

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.271
What are you guys doing here?

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.273
Callum said you
might need a hand.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.733
We're at your service, sir.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.361
[BECK]
De-lish!

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.324
We recently hired some people,

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:51.161
so rest assured the Lenaf shop
is fully staffed right now.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.788
The rookies all took to their
positions like cleaning slimes

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.206
to grime.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.458
That's wonderful.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.710
You all coming to help
is wonderful, too.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.128
Seriously, thanks.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.131
Everyone working the stall
is guaranteed a break!

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.550
[chattering]

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.178
[CAULKIN laughs]

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.471
Excellent point.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.306
You can afford a break as well.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.266
[RYOMA]
I was off yesterday.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.935
Please just listen, sir.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.853
You're a citizen of Gimul, too.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.813
Go enjoy its biggest event.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:19.773
Right.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.984
Thanks for always lookin'
out, but before breaktime,

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.986
I have one more thing to do.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.372
[PRENANCE]
Grandeur incarnate!

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.415
[RYOMA]
I'll say.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.292
Oh, but aren't you chilly?

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:43.213
My barrier combined with my ice
magic keeps this place freezing.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.674
I'm overwhelmed by your
sculpture's elegance,

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.760
so its beauty makes the
cold wholly unnoticeable!

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:55.392
Alas, my mouth can't
contain my heart.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.560
I'll perform my very best
to equal the radiance

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.896
of this stunning work of art.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.690
Um, great.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.108
Really looking forward to it.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.531
If you're here, I take it you
finished your last chore?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:10.991
[RYOMA]
Uh-huh!

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:11.825
Good.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.368
That means it's
breaktime for you, sir.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.122
[SERGE]
Mister Ryoma! Hello yet again.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.081
[RYOMA]
Hey.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.750
You and Mister Pioro
having a good time?

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.586
We would have a better time
if you joined us for a chat.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.422
Sure. I'm actually
free right now.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.014
[SERGE] This grain tea
is tremendously popular.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.266
Causing quite a "stir,"
in tea terms.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.977
Yeah. The entire team's
upselling it when they can.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.858
It's very nice.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.234
Wow, that aroma!

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.445
It's just so unique compared
to the scent of other teas

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.571
and herbs.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.448
I'm really flattered you're
so fond of this stuff,

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.699
Mister Serge.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.035
Care to share where
you got the grains for it?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.329
They all came from the hometown
of a few of my employees.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.874
They had a whole bunch
left over this season.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.209
There's more?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.050
[MARIA] So merchants actually
want the grains from

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.051
our village?

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:14.137
Yes! They wanna try and
create a proper business

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.973
using grain-based teas
as their starter products!

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.516
Are you pulling our legs?

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.392
[RYOMA]
Nope.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.437
Look at how well the grain tea's
been selling at our stall.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.482
With Mister Serge and Mister
Pioro supporting this venture,

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.025
I know it'll be a success.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.694
How could it be
anything less, right?

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:30.904
Oh, wow.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.656
That'd make our entire
hometown's day, or year!

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.408
We can't thank you enough!

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.494
No need for thanks.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.412
I didn't do anything,
but we can work out

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.331
all the details another day.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.416
[GROUP] Sure! But we
really should thank you!

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.503
[RYOMA] Once their village
starts making a profit,

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.505
the younger residents won't
be forced to find work

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.298
so far away.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.508
At least, I hope so.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:53.885
[CARLA]
Manager!

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.013
It's time to take that break
we've been talking about!

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.223
Oh. Right.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.474
Break starting now.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.268
[ASAGI]
I side with Miss Carla.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.562
You can't properly enjoy the
festival if you're working

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.855
the whole time.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.273
[RYOMA]
True.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.025
[RYOMA]
Plus, I'd be a hypocrite.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.694
Have to practice what I
preach to all my employees.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.447
[MIYA]
Thanks fur waiting!

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.160
Tasties are served!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.871
There's no beating my
tenmusu and miso soup.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.123
Can't wait to dig in!

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.759
Mm! It's even better
than the last time!

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.846
Some improvements have been
made since your previous sample.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.098
They're really paw-pular
among the townsfolk.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.019
Wow! I see why!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.980
Gotta tell my
employees about this!

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.565
Almost feels like
a crime not to!

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:02.537
[crying]
Where'd Mommy go?

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.207
Poor little guy's lost, huh?

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.669
Peek-a-boo. I see you!

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.212
[ELIARIA]
You really blew up, didn't you?

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.176
I'll finally see Mister Ryoma!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.385
[RYOMA]
I'll send more letters.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.970
[ELIARIA]
These segments should be longer!

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.269
[RYOMA] Do you remember
where you last saw your mom?

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.024
Do you know where you live?

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.445
He could be from out of town.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:37.906
I know I haven't seen
him around here.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.324
[RYOMA]
Neither have I.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.117
Lots of visitors thanks
to the festival,

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.744
so that's probably it.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.622
Do you think maybe we should
take him to the town guards?

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.957
I'm sure his meow-ther
is looking for him, too.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:52.837
[chuckles]

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.381
Look at that.
He's taken a liking to you.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.217
[RYOMA]
Huh?

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.219
[THEO crying]

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.889
Let's go find your mom, okay?

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.852
I think I can handle
this on my own.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.520
We're counting on mew!

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.440
[RYOMA]
I'm Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.067
What's your name?

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:15.485
[THEO]
Theo.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:18.988
Well, Theo, did you come to
the festival with your mom?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.031
Yeah.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.075
Is this your first
festival ever?

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.701
Uh-huh!

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.912
This is my first one, too.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.330
Really?

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.917
[RYOMA] Yep. I lived somewhere
else for a long time.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:31.960
[THEO]
Where?

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.630
[RYOMA]
A place far away.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.175
Very far.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:42.679
A place called Earth, where I
worked for an exploitative

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.807
company in Japan.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.268
Where I died, and by
the grace of the gods,

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.354
was reincarnated
here in Seilfall.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.486
Then, I met Elia and the rest
of her wonderful family.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.072
I left the comfort of my cave
and traveled with them.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.493
Then came to the
mining town of Gimul

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.121
where I started up Bamboo
Forest Laundry Service.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.460
I've come quite a ways,
now that I think about it.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:20.300
Uh-- Oh. Just lost in thought.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:21.843
[GLISSELA]
Whatcha doin' with a kid, kid?

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:22.885
What?

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.431
I'm helping him find his mom.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:27.974
Figured taking him
to the guards' office

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.726
would be the safest bet.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.686
Don't let this
old lady keep you.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.955
[GLISSELA] You've really
established yourself as a true

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.457
citizen of Gimul.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.791
Do you think so?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.959
I do.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.045
But I'm also curious
how town life compares

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:59.255
to the way you lived when
you were in the woods.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.968
[RYOMA] I don't know if one's
better than the other.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.220
The forest definitely
had its perks.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.018
Judging from your
expression, I'd say it's fine.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.645
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.440
[RYOMA] But life in
Gimul isn't bad either.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.692
[THEO'S MOTHER]
Theo! I was worried sick!

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.111
[THEO]
Mommy!

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.739
Thanks so much for brining
my little boy back to me.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.074
Welcome.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.409
See ya, Theo! Bye-bye!

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.619
Bye-bye!

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.832
[RYOMA]
Yeah.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.210
Fair to say life here
isn't bad at all.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.300
[PRENANCE] The beast that
tormented the people lies

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.427
vanquished before me.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:49.180
It will live among us
and follow a new path

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.432
now and forever more!

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.601
Come! Rejoice, one and all!

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.269
Let us celebrate this day!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.820
[GROUP gasps]

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:21.546
[GROUP gasps]

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:42.233
[SELMA] Smells good, but what
exactly do you call this dish?

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.568
[RYOMA]
Fried Noodles.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.195
What's neat about it is it can
be flavored a couple ways,

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.073
but I kept it simple and
just used salt this time.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.700
It looks very appetizing!

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.202
I'll have to cook it for
lunch one of these days.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.329
Make it a day that I'm around!

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.540
This should be enough
for the after party, right?

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:58.958
How much more can people eat?

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:02.462
[CALLUM]
Manager?

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:05.923
I haven't seen a single
Semroid Troupe member

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.550
since the end of the show.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:10.553
Well, maybe the cleanup took a
little longer than they thought.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:11.971
I'll go and check the stage.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.105
[RYOMA]
What are they doing?

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.069
Ryoma!

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.198
Your troupe's amazing!

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.200
That really what
you came to tell us?

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.618
The after party starts soon,

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.786
and I wanna make
sure you're all there.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.456
But what's with the statue?

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.540
This?

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.918
[RYOMA]
Is it divine or something?

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.753
[MAIYA]
Quite the rare sight, huh?

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.547
It's a statue of Manoailoa.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.257
[RYOMA]
Manoailoa? Huh.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.595
I remember that name
from one of the myths.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.680
I haven't met them yet,
but they're definitely

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.599
a god of this world,
right up there with Gain

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.559
and the others.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.187
I think that's the
god of wind, right?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.230
Yes, indeed.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.148
A glorious deity that
watches over us through

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.860
both gentle and powerful winds
that sweep across Seilfall.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.987
They also just so happen
to be a god of travels

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.239
and the creative arts.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.158
Which is why Manoailoa's
often worshiped

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.827
by traveling artists
from all walks of life!

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.081
So, we were dressing up
the statue a little bit more.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:21.207
What for?

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:24.168
Well when we experience
anything that's memorable,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.003
we buy a piece of
cloth in whatever town

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.297
the memorable thing happened in.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.758
We have to travel light because
we're on the road so much,

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.802
but we can afford a piece
of fabric to express

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:35.179
our thanks to the god for
blessing us with great

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.431
experiences and encounters.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.849
And we aren't the only ones.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.352
It's a tradition all traveling
entertainers have.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.438
Couldn't tell you where it
originated from, though.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.316
Memories from travels.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.032
[CARLA]
Listen up, everyone.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.493
The manager has a few
words before we begin.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.331
All right, sir.
The floor is yours.

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:03.332
Okay.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.045
Thanks for your hard work!

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:12.216
Each of you made the festival
a success, so cheers to you!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.467
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.470
[JANE]
It's delicious!

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:17.555
[SERGE]
Yes.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.432
[GROUP chattering]

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.103
Thanks a lot, man.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.439
Today was so fun!

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.274
We bought tons of goodies
with the money we made

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.276
working your stall.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.819
You took care of us.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.821
You and your nifty slimes.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:34.780
Aw.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:35.990
Did you enjoy it, too?

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.241
You had better say yes.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.162
Well, had to help
a kid find his mom,

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.914
but after that, I got
to have a little fun.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.416
Just as you should.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:49.211
By the way, thank you
for helping us out today.

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:53.132
Right when I got in a fix,
you showed up and solved it.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.593
I'm actually rather
happy we came as well.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.553
It kind of rejuvenated
me in a way.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:03.768
And while I haven't been away
from this town that long,

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.313
I did feel a little nostalgic
once we were back here.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.773
Ryoma.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.900
Um, yes, Miss Maiya?

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.026
You wanna dance?

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.819
We could wrap up the
night with a quick show!

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.782
Do it! Do it!

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.493
A spectacular finale, yes?

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:23.829
[chattering]

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.581
Well, if I must.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.000
It's just for fun.
No pressure.

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:30.211
Right. Gonna relax and enjoy!

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.580
[RYOMA]
Today was some day.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.597
[RYOMA] I'll engrave it
in my memory forever.

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.021
[RYOMA]
More grain tea?

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.732
It's just that good.

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:35.609
Your dance and music were
wonderful, by the way.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.570
It's nice of you to say that.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.448
Um, so I kind of
have a tiny request?

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.455
[RYOMA] The Foundation
Festival became a day

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.831
that I won't soon forget.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.836
To commemorate such an
extraordinary time in my life,

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.423
I asked Mister Serge to have
two special music boxes made.

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.346
One of which is included
with this letter.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.438
It sounds beautiful.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.233
[RYOMA] I am so, so glad
I came to Gimul.

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:20.654
I found a place I can call
home, a place I belong,

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.240
and I vow to continue
serving this community

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:27.578
however I can, whenever I can,
to the best of my ability.

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:32.500
Good for you.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:35.377
Just reading that makes me want
to improve and push myself

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.297
harder so when the
two of us reunite,

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:40.549
you'll see with your own
eyes how far I've come.

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.721
[MIYABI]
Elia! Let's go!

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.014
'Kay!

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.186
[MAN A]
G'morning.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.562
[RYOMA]
Same to you, sir!

00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:55.022
[WOMAN B]
Nice weather, huh?

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.357
[RYOMA]
Real nice!

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:07.910
[RYOMA] Let's do our best,
just like always!

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.415
[RYOMA]
Morning, everyone!

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.542
[GROUP]
Good morning!

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.001
Nice to see you, boss!
