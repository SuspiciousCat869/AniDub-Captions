[RYOMA panting]

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.438
Time sure does fly, doesn't it?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.025
Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil,

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.152
I hope this letter
finds you well.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.071
Hey. Always a pleasure!

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.406
[RYOMA] In the short while since
I left the care of your family

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.825
to live by myself here
in the town of Gimul,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.286
life's honestly been
pretty amazing.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.329
Ours sure is.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.914
If you couldn't tell as much.

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.499
Yeah, what a morning rush!

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.543
Sorry I wasn't here
sooner to lend a hand.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:43.919
Rare for you to be late.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.880
I won't make a habit
out of it, so don't worry.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:50.634
Hours always feel like seconds
whenever I'm studying slimes.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.678
[CUSTOMERS chattering]

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.305
You bet!

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:56.890
Whatever your laundry
needs may be,

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.017
we're here to take
care of them all.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.394
Next customer, please.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.853
Right this way!

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.314
Wow! It looks completely new.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.274
Of course.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.109
Rest assured, we get rid
of any scum that makes

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.777
its way in here!

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.113
There you are! Good morning.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.155
[RYOMA]
Same to you.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.782
Things running smoothly?

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:14.700
Indeed.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.285
We've got it under control!

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.995
Thank you for the reassurance.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.708
Something sure smells good.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.209
Oh! Good morning.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.044
Just prepping
things for lunchtime.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.713
It's always nice
to see your smile.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.756
Looking forward
to another great day.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.805
[RYOMA] Every person and
slime is working very hard

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:39.141
to keep Bamboo Forest
flourishing,

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.226
so as the manager,
it's my job to provide

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.730
a proper work environment
worthy of their dedication.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.815
Hey! Morning, everyone!

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.735
Another day, another
chance to do our best!

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:50.777
[CALLUM, CARLA]
Right!

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.545
[RYOMA]
What?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.922
[CARLA]
Allow me to explain again.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.091
The time you arrived
today was perfect,

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.468
so why not make
it a routine for you?

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.970
Why so late though?

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:43.056
We haven't had a slow
morning since we opened.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.809
How busy we are has
nothing to do with it, sir.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.978
This is about how you do
all the preparation work

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.188
when you get here
before we open.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.898
You take work away
from your employees

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.400
when you do that.

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:56.319
Prepping is also a
good chance to train.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.113
And not just us,
it's a good chance

00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.698
for you to train, too.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.533
You can learn to
delegate and rely on others

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.034
to handle things.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.163
[RYOMA] I was robbing my
own staff of opportunities.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.706
Okay, I gotcha.

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:10.292
From now on,
I'll start coming in later.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.209
Thank you, sir.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.378
Though, there is one
more suggestion I have.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.463
I'm all ears.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.673
In regard to a second shop, I...

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.718
[CUSTOMERS laughing]

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.514
Hey, what's all the hullabaloo?

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:29.269
Almost done tying, then I'll
tell ya all about it, sir! Ha!

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.730
[RYOMA] Those guys aren't
customers of ours, are they?

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.315
They're nothing but a
couple o' crooks who came

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.400
to the wrong shop
to try 'n' complain.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.278
Huh? We heard a bunch of
laughter, not anyone yelling

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.446
or complaining.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.323
[MARIA]
Well... [giggles]

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.532
Hey!

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.202
Do you see how dirty
this thing still is?

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.661
Mine's filthy, too!

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.288
This shop is a joke!

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.665
--Um...
--Whoa.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:51.583
The heck?

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.335
Didn't I tell you to
dirty these up so bad

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.795
they'd be stained forever?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.254
That's exactly what I did!

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.006
[CUSTOMERS laugh]

00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.299

Idiots!

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.467
We ain't no idiots!

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.760
I dare ya to say it again!

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:02.969
[BOTH yell]

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.806
[blows landing]

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.766
[LI LING] I'll go turn
them in to the guards.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.435
[FINA]
And there you have it, boss.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.311
Oh.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.063
My goodness, what a nuisance.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.023
I guess they weren't listening
when I said we get rid of

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.276
any scum that makes
its way in here.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.153
[RYOMA] Maybe I should give
some more thought to beefing up

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.781
security around here.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.032
Like the glass.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.619
Oh! Is our meeting adjourned?

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:28.912
I suppose.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.748
Because I was just struck
by a wave of inspiration,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.500
so I'm heading back
to the mines!

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.466
[RYOMA]
Okay.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.635
I'll have the sticky slimes make
some hardening solution

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.719
to start.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.645
Then I'll use a separation
circle to remove moisture.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.526
Add another layer
of hardening solution.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.281
Then blend it with
a mixture circle.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.080
And remove moisture once again.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.335
The more I repeat
this simple process,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.045
the more condensed
the hardening solution

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.255
will wind up being.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.346
Good, but it needs to
be shaped into a sheet.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.942
Enhancement magic
didn't even crack it.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.360
And it's clear enough
that it should work

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.530
just fine as a replacement
for window glass.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.366
But the safety factor was
the most important part.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.368
I'll rest easier knowing
my staff and clients

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.162
are better protected.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.330
Excellent work!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.124
But I'm going to need a whole
lot more of these things.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.417
You guys up to it?

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.967
Yeah, that oughta be plenty.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.893
I should probably get
some sleep, huh?

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:20.106
Huh? Never seen that dark
green slime before!

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.151
Appraisal.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.531
Says you're a medicine slime.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.326
But I would've remembered
making that contract.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.995
Did you evolve, maybe?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.581
A spear mastery skillset?

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:40.585
I'd bet my shop you were
a poison slime before!

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.212
I wonder what you
could've done to change

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.422
into a medicine slime, though.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.465
Wait.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.513
I accidentally dropped a
bottle of antidote yesterday.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.060
Ah! No one panic!

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.445
It's gone.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.157
I assumed the cleaner
slimes soaked it up

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.660
while I was in the other
room, but I guess not.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:14.953
Was it a fluke?

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.667
Nope! The others love it, too!

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.253
So turning into a medicine
slime's just natural

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.296
with a steady diet
of antidote! Heh!

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.592
Medicine's pretty broad.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.847
Will you show me what
kinds you can make?

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.223
If you don't mind, of course.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.649
Oh, quite a few, apparently.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.859
Let's appraise these.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.320
Ointment.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.864
Hemostat.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.574
Antidote.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.325
Fast poison.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.910
Slow poison.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.038
Fast paralysis poison.

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:03.334
Slow paralysis poison and
antibacterial medicine.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.795
As extensive as
it is impressive!

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.881
I guess both medicines
and poisons count

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.050
as drug synthesis,
but what's this

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.885
"antibacterial medicine?"

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.434
"A fluid with strong
antibacterial properties.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.020
Most effective when used
to kill viruses and germs.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.272
However, it's harmless
to humans."

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.191
So, it's a disinfectant!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.194
This'll definitely
come in handy.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.863
I'll gradually make a difference
with what power I have,

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.448
one step at a time.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.993
I've also gotta prove to
the Jamil ducal family

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.828
that I'm okay on my own
so they don't worry

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.080
about me.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.625
Oh, you know what?

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.543
I haven't caught up
with the gods in a minute.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.963
I've just been so busy with
my research and my shop.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.715
I'll stop by the
church tomorrow!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.471
That kid's back at it, doing
even more interesting things!

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.559
[RYOMA] Hello!
Happy to be with you again!

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.608
[ELIARIA] You're always on
my mind, Mister Ryoma.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.901
Every day!

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.405
[NUN A]
Welcome.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.783
May I ask what brings
you to our door today?

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:17.992
[RYOMA]
Prayer.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.496
Ah, I see.
Continue this way, please.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.331
Yes ma'am, thank you very much!

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.926
Huh? What gives?

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.886
I was expecting to get
sent to the gods' realm

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.139
like always, but no dice.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.015
This must be how most
people feel when they pray

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.308
in here.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.567
Ah, there we go.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.610
The usual big, blank void.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.946
Was there a specific
reason for the delay?

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.532
[TEKUN] Just that I
rarely use that power.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.659
Took a minute for me to
figure out how it works.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.702
Sorry.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:05.206
[RYOMA] Unless Gain, Lulutia,
or Kufo got a makeover,

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.625
this must be some other god.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.711
I'm very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:10.795
I live here now.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.131
In Gimul, I mean, not
in your sacred realm,

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.341
so I wanted to come
and pay my respects.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.384
[TEKUN]
I know.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.012
I'm Tekun, god of technology
and craftsmanship.

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.555
And just talk freely, kid.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.307
Formalities are
pointless with me,

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.641
so you can just drop 'em.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.143
If I wanted to, I could
read every thought

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.187
racing inside your head!

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.397
I'm a smooth-talker's
worst nightmare.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.691
And besides, I don't
like being formal.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.194
Now, sit your butt down.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.904
Well, in that case.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.197
Nice to meetcha!

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:40.241
I'm Ryoma Takebayashi, and...

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.577
...I made those.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.746
At least, I think I did.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:48.082
Well they're actually copies
of the ones you made.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.751
Hope you don't mind,
but I wanted a better look

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.002
at your work.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.879
So then they're kind
of like replicas.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.715
[TEKUN] The world you originally
hail from is Earth, right?

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:56.758
Yes.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.303
One day, I was working for
a company that completely

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.930
took advantage of me.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.682
The next, I died in my sleep
after an embarrassingly

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.226
bad sneeze.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.103
Then, three gods who saw
my fate decided to intercept

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.232
my soul and reincarnate me
into this world as a boy.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.069
Yeah. I heard the whole thing.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.779
While your story's neat,
you know what I find

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.739
really fascinating?

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:23.034
Talents and special techniques
from another world.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.161
[RYOMA] I'm shocked
figurine-making counts.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.622
[TEKUN] A foreign culture
using a unique crafting method

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.123
absolutely counts!

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.209
Did you miss when I said
I'm the god of technology

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.335
and craftsmanship?

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.503
I can't get enough!

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:35.338
I'm only a god of
this world, though.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.923
So while I know all
there is to know about

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.759
the techniques of Seilfall,
it's just a drop in the ocean!

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.469
I had no clue your
knowledge was limited

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.805
to your own world, so no
wonder you're intrigued!

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.098
I would be too!

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.641
Because you get it!

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.768
What also makes your
figures stand out to me

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.063
is that they were obviously
made with the utmost care.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.691
Though it doesn't appear
to be your main craft,

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.360
you did spend a significant
amount of time honing it,

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:58.486
right, kid?

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.364
Creating things was a
huge hobby of mine, yeah.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.741
And I actually did rake in
a decent amount of money

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.827
through sales and
commissions back on Earth,

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.453
which encouraged me to improve.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:10.164
I couldn't slack since
I was getting paid.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.374
Yeah, that's normal.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.834
Great frame of mind to have.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.377
Which is why you'd
think all artisans

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.379
would feel that way,
but they don't.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.299
As a god of craftsmanship,
I like people who care about

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.967
doing a bang-up job.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.427
I have no doubt.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.304
Just curious,
but are you the only god

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:25.596
who's gonna show up?

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.681
Uh-huh.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.516
See, everybody
does their own thing

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.768
and occupies their own area.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.229
What looks like a hollow,
white void to you

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.772
is different for us gods.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.858
And what feels good
to the God of Beasts

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:40.153
may feel off to the God of
Magic or the god of Earth.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.821
But once they find their spot,

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.032
they build what humans
would call a home

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.199
and live there.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.492
Gods make homes?

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.202
I never would've guessed it.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.079
This "spot" is where you live?

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.081
The table really
ties it together.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:52.957
Nah!

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.917
I'm perfectly content
being homeless.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.795
I'm just not meant to stay
in one place for too long.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.006
Technologies and crafts
exist every which way

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.132
you turn.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.509
So, I'm happiest traveling
about as I please,

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.802
learning as I go.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.513
But I can tell you the place
we're having this little chat

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.766
is connected to Seilfall.

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.434
If you're confused,
it's probably because

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.519
I'm not the best at
explaining this stuff.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.105
I understand the fundamentals,
but words are tough.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.148
Sorry, kid.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.358
Try Fernobelia.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.985
He'd break it down for ya,
no doubt about it!

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.779
Who's Fernobelia?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.781
I've never come across
that name before.

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:26.741
[TEKUN] Thought maybe you
knew 'im for some reason.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.243
He's the God of Magic
and Academics.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:32.038
Then again, he does close
himself off in his realm,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.040
so it makes sense
that you haven't met.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.833
As for what he does
in that realm,

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.710
your guess is as good as mine.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.837
But I'd be surprised if
there's anything that guy

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.298
doesn't know or
can't explain to you.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.634
Thing is, he rarely
speaks to anyone,

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:48.054
even if his audience is a
fellow god like yours truly.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.847
But, hey, you never know, kid.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.682
You might luck out and
meet him at least once

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:52.809
in your life.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.478
[RYOMA] Sounds like there
are lots of types of gods.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.397
Sure are.

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.690
I think this means my
prayer time is up.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.068
There's still so much
I wanted to talk about.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.486
[RYOMA]
I'll come again.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.489
[chuckles] That day can't get
here soon enough!

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.416
[RYOMA]
Thank you for helping me.

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:19.127
It was my pleasure,
but I should be thanking you!

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.586
That was quite a donation!

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.797
[RYOMA]
Well, I wanted to give it.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.758
Paid my dues and respects,
so now it's back to work!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.554
[CUSTOMERS chattering]

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.056
[RYOMA] So, were you guys
able to manage even though

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.225
I came in a little
later than usual?

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.060
Everything's going great!

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.687
The new workers stepped up.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.064
They've got a fairly good
grasp on their jobs now.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.649
Always nice to hear.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.733
That's awesome!

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.235
[FEI]
Yes, but is that it?

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.195
Surely there's something
else you wish to discuss

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.406
with all of us.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.908
Yes, there is, and though
it may seem a bit random,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.326
it's about our windows.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:55.538
Just think, if somebody
wanted to break in

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.915
it would be a cinch
for them, wouldn't it?

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.251
[FEI] Were they armed
with a hammer or axe,

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.003
it would be pretty simple, yes.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.630
[LI LING] We plan our security
detail with that in mind.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.883
I appreciate you for
being so vigilant,

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:09.760
but what if we made the
windows harder to break?

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.846
It'd make things more
difficult for crooks,

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.931
yet much easier for
you to protect us.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.853
I'm thinking of replacing
our glass windowpanes

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.188
with these beauts.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:21.606
They're super durable.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.069
[ALL gasp]

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:31.616
It looks tough but may I also
test it out, Manager?

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.534
Absolutely! Go for it!

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.286
And there's no need to
hold back since I have

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.662
a couple of spares.

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.039
[FEI]
If I may, sir.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.922
[LI LING]
Here goes!

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.257
[vocalizing]

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.509
Impressive.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.260
She hasn't made
a single crack in it.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.804
I take it you're the inventor
of this new marvel?

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:54.805
That's correct.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.849
I could see this being a
very successful product,

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.059
should you market it.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.395
Yeah, I don't doubt
it for a second.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.940
It isn't my intent to sell
these things, though.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.192
It's a little tricky to
mass-produce them.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.902
Oh. I see.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.737
Sorry for assuming, sir.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.696
All right.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.449
Use your enhancement
magic on it, Li Ling.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.534
If you insist!

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.503
They really are super durable!

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.505
Passed my mega-punch
test, at least.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.965
Intruders will be in
for a big surprise

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.467
if you put these
on the first floor!

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:33.427
Although, it'd be just
as tough to break out

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:34.971
as it is to break in, sir.

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.597
If we get cornered,
we won't have the option

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.474
of escaping through a window.

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:39.559
Oh.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.936
Yeah, that is a
major disadvantage.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.688
I didn't even think of that!

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.648
[FEI] But there's no denying
how useful it would be

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.483
in preventing intruders.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.068
I say we take out
some of the windows

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.237
around the shop and
put these in instead,

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.072
placed strategically.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.157
We'll think like thieves
and plan around possible

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.325
break-in points.

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.743
Now there's an idea!

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.578
Let's vote.

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.329
All in favor of
replacing some windows

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.831
with tougher ones, say "Aye."

00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:02.873
[GROUP]
Aye!

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:04.834
It's settled.

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:06.460
I'll start right away then.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:07.461
Right away?

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:10.172
What about your meeting with the
Morgan Trading Company today?

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.091
You have an appointment
with Mister Serge later.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.884
Oh! I nearly forgot!

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.178
You can just leave the
construction project to us.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.221
[LI LING]
Mm-hmm!

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.056
Thanks for the help.
It's in your hands.

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.766
Oh, Manager?

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:23.269
There's one last thing I'd
like to address with you.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.270
Okay.

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:26.480
What do you think about
opening up a second shop

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:27.898
in a neighboring town?

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.108
Ah...

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.986
Honestly, I think it's still
a bit too soon for that.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.654
I disagree sir.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:35.656
Since we now have more manpower,

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:38.993
will you at least
reconsider your decision?

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.911
We do have more workers.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.371
Sure, I'll think about it.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:50.546
[RYOMA] I only just started
living by myself here in Gimul.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.341
It feels way too early for me
to set up a laundry service

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:56.344
in a different town.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:57.970
Baby steps.

00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:00.389
For now, I'll prioritize
building better relationships

00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.058
within Gimul.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.893
[SERGE]
Welcome, Mister Ryoma.

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:05.478
It's good to see you.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.563
[RYOMA]
Likewise, Mister Serge.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.191
Believe it or not, I came
here as a shopper today.

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:11.609
I'm at your service.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.569
What exactly is it you need?

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.196
Containers to store medicine.

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.406
Do you sell large
quantities of bottles?

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:19.742
You're buying in bulk?
Very smart.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:20.993
You think?

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.578
I just like to be prepared.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.664
As I'm sure you
figured out by now,

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.374
adventurers are prone to injury,

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.209
so I wanna stockpile
some remedies.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.628
hence my quest for bottles.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.296
Nothing wrong with that.

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.173
But if the only thing on
your shopping list today

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.967
is a large amount of bottles,
I suggest you register

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.136
as a chemist at
the Merchant's Guild.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.055
Once you do, you'll
be able purchase them

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.766
at a discount from the
wholesaler, through the Guild.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.060
You see?

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.062
What an interesting new hobby.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.356
So, you want to use these
bottles to store medicine,

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.066
do you, boy?

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:55.027
That's the plan. Mister Serge
said registering as a chemist

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.570
would get me the best deal.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.197
I imagine it would, yes,

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.324
but have you the talent
it takes to qualify?

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.326
Uh, I'd like to think so.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:07.707
This one is an antidote,
and this is a disinfectant.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:08.791
Ah-ha.

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:14.672
You're pretty good, kid.
These check out.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.508
If you can crank out medicine
like this on the regular,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.885
perhaps you can live
as a chemist, as well.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:22.680
[RYOMA] Good to know,
but I think I'll pass for now.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.474
Yes. Your current career
path should be leading you

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:28.018
straight to the doorstep of
your second laundry store.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.854
--[RYOMA] Huh?
--Should it not?

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.021
[RYOMA]
Well, um...

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.441
Funny you should mention it,
since one of my staff members

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.484
was just saying
the exact same thing,

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.570
but isn't it still
too soon for that?

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.071
[GLISSELA]
And who's the judge of that?

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.615
'Cause if you ask me,
I think you would do just fine

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:42.867
with another shop.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.201
[RYOMA]
You do, huh?

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.202
Oh.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.121
Are you, perhaps,
hesitating because you don't

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.914
have the necessary funds?

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.250
Selling your medicines could
be a nice side business

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.460
to help with that.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:54.587
And as a favor to you,
I'd be willing to buy

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:55.880
your whole stock.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.298
What? All of them?

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.300
[GLISSELA] Just goes to
show how high my hopes are

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:00.718
for you, boy.

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:11.604
I'll do it someday, but doing it
now doesn't feel right.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:14.023
[bird caws]

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.566
A limour bird!

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.234
Must be a letter from Elia!

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:23.073
[ELIARIA]
Dear Mister Ryoma,

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.493
thank you for your
thoughtful letter!

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:28.704
Things are finally settling down
after my long journey home,

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:32.333
so I wanted to take this
chance to write you back.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:35.252
My family is as happy
and healthy as ever.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.171
You'll be glad to know
the slimes you graciously

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.089
lent to me are also doing well.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.597
I'm delighted you're
working just as hard

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.058
as you were when I left,
and I'm motivated

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:51.143
to do my best, too,
because of it.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.191
[RYOMA] But am I really
giving it my best?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.444
What do you think about
opening up a second shop

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.946
in a neighboring town?

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.447
And who's the judge of that?

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.366
'Cause if you ask me,
I think you would do

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.451
just fine with another shop.

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:11.997
[RYOMA]
A second shop!

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.711
Elia.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.713
Thanks for giving me
the push I needed!
