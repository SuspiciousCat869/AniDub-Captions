WEBVTT

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.427
[SELMA]
Everything's ready!

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.929
[ALL]
Oooh!

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:20.187
These are all of the dishes
that I believe will sell

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.856
at a stall or rather,
the ones that will sell best.

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.608
[MARIA]
I wasn't expecting so many!

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.109
That's amazing!

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.321
I've never seen semesa used
in dumplings until now!

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.865
You've gotta share the
recipe with us, Miss Selma!

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:33.242
I'd be happy to!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.660
Let's cook them together.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.119
More food!

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.163
[MARIA] Are you really okay
with making another batch?

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.748
You intend to sell all of those?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.959
I asked her to cook what she
thought would be popular

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.293
and she just really went for it!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.336
Here's an idea.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:47.339
So, the Semroid Troupe should be
arriving sometime tonight.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.966
What do you say
we serve these dishes

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.509
at the welcoming party for them?

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.927
Based on their reactions,

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.721
we can narrow down what
we actually serve at our stall.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.056
[RYOMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.060
Enjoy yourselves tonight

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:01.812
but try and save
some of that energy

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.564
for the welcoming
party tomorrow!

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.856
[JANE, MARIA, FINA, SELMA agree]

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:07.943
I'm so relieved.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.654
Seems like the festival
has everyone excited.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.489
That's true, however...

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.658
Not the best way
to start a sentence.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.827
[CALLUM] It takes more than
enthusiasm to run a stall,

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.245
and even with a smaller menu,

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:20.122
I fear we might
still be short-staffed.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.456
Yeah, good point.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.041
Cooking is just one part of it.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:23.959
We'll also need servers

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.628
and someone to direct
traffic if we get busy, huh?

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.839
[CALLUM] Right, which is
why I suggest we consider

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.550
hiring some temporary staff.

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.093
[RYOMA]
Hmmm...

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.720
[knock, knock]

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.223
[SERGE] Sorry to disturb you at
such a late hour, Mister Ryoma,

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.474
but I thought you
might like to meet

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.310
the leader of
the Semroid Troupe.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.437
Ah. Come on in!

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.067
It's an honor and pleasure

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.903
to make your acquaintance,
great sage.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.587
You know, when I learned
I'd be meeting a gifted youth,

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.797
I was thrilled!

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.632
I'm actually on
the younger side as well,

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.634
and I'm already the head
of the Semroid Troupe.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.595
Prenance Semroid at your
service, magnificent sage!

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.056
I think the honor in
this situation is mine,

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.350
but do you think you
could maybe call me Ryoma

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.560
instead of, "sage"?

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.354
I really don't merit
a title like that, so...

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.941
Oh! How incredibly humble!

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.777
[PRENANCE]
The music box!

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.530
You invented a new way to
delicately flavor our melodies

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.615
with that exquisite
little creation!

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:01.992
Hence, you're a sage!

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.035
It's the only word that works.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.288
Oh!

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.542
However, who am I to question
the desires of the great sage?

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.294
So, I shall address
you as "Mister Ryoma,"

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.212
if that is truly what you wish.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.673
Um. It's what I wish,
so thank you.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.842
Oh, no. If anyone's
deserving of thanks,

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.011
it is you, my fine,
modest friend.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.471
Your pocket-sized
box will allow us

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.723
to distribute
our music far and wide.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.100
'Tis a tiny trinket worthy
of the biggest praise.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.144
What's more!
You kindly opened your doors

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.937
so that we could have
a comfortable greenroom.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.565
You're as generous
as you are wise, sir.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.941
Our entire troupe
should have come here

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.985
to express our gratitude.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.987
I apologize for coming alone.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.781
Forgive me.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.034
You're fine! It's late
and you only just arrived.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.494
I'm surprised you came at all.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.829
I would've greeted
my pillow first and foremost.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.540
I'll add empathetic to
your list of admirable traits.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.459
Guess I am rather
sleepy and tense

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.586
from being alert
the entire journey.

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.880
[CALLUM]
Was there monster activity?

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.632
Yes. My troupe and
I traveled through

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.175
the southern plains to get here.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:01.009
But before we left,

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.595
we were told that tunnel ants
were seen along the highway.

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:04.805
--[CALLUM] Oh, boy.
--[SERGE] I see.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.306
I've heard of murder ants.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.475
Are they as dangerous as those?

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.435
Well, not in the way
you're thinking.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:14.105
You see, murder ants are hostile
to us, but tunnel ants are not.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.315
They focus on digging

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.484
and building vast
colonies underground.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.444
And therein lies the issue.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.404
The tunnels they
dig hollow out the ground.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.156
Carriages run the risk
of collapsing them

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.407
and getting trapped.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.952
Luckily, we were able
to avoid such a disaster,

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.620
but it was quite stressful.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.914
Ohh...

00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:32.290
[RYOMA]
Hmmm...

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.584
I certainly hope they don't
affect the festival turnout,

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.128
or the ongoing preparations,
for that matter.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.463
Me too, but it sounds
like something

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.715
that the Adventurer's Guild
may be working on,

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:41.800
and if that's the case,

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.219
I guess my schedule
for tomorrow is decided.

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.556
Very understandable. I'll take
care of the welcome party, sir,

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.932
and the shop, of course.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:49.975
Bravo!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.018
To think your wisdom and
kindness are complemented

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.187
by the valiant
soul of a warrior!

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.482
My, the gods must adore you,
Mister Ryoma!

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.234
One can always hope.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.196
Oh. Welcome back!

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.198
Nice to see you again,
Miss Paena.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.074
Likewise.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.410
How can I be of service
to you, Mister Ryoma?

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.953
Do you have
any open jobs related

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.205
to the tunnel ants
spotted in the area?

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:14.416
Surprised the news
reached you so quickly.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.667
Just a moment, please.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.920
I've got listings related to
tunnel ants somewhere in here.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.463
Ah. Please take your pick.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.966
Great, let's see
what we got here.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.635
Hunting ants and
locating colonies.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:28.847
There's a job for
excavating colonies, too.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.265
Out of the three different jobs,

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.225
which one could use
the most help?

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.894
Think that would be the one

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.104
that involves
locating the colonies.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.608
It's a little time-consuming,
so it isn't that popular.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:40.609
Gotcha.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.194
Then sign me up for tracking
down some tunnel ant colonies,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.487
if you'd be so kind.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.698
Thanks a lot for helping out!

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:58.752
All right, everyone!

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.755
Keep your eyes peeled
for tunnel ant colonies!

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.679
And now, Share Sensations.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.435
What did Miss Paena say again?

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.313
[PAENA] Tunnel ants are known
to arrange the soil they dig up

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.231
in piles all around
their colonies.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.318
So, if you come across
some freshly disturbed dirt,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.196
chances are there's a
colony right under your nose.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.118
See any recently dug-up dirt?

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.247
Like that!

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.041
Oh.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.008
Wait, I know them.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.595
[RYOMA]
Hey!

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.349
Hey! Well, what're the odds?

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.393
Right? Looks like you're on

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.061
Adventurer's Guild
business, too.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.689
Yup, yup. We want the
southern plains back to normal

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.691
since we pick herbs
out here all the time.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.818
If you want somethin' done,
then do it yourself.

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.861
[RYOMA]
Yeah, I'm with you there.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.239
[FINIA]
Wist?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.074
Beck?

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.118
[BECK]
Me? Oh right, introductions.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.077
This is Ryoma!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.371
You know, that cool kid
I told you about.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.957
Oh. This is the
super strong slime guy?

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:22.627
[RYOMA] Uh. I guess that's
not technically inaccurate.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.714
Well, anyway,
I'm Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.174
It's very nice to meet you.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.301
And I'm Finia.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.095
Sorry, I'm shy.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.388
Call me Ruth, okay?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.015
And here's my sis.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.891
His "little" sis, Rumille!

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.310
If you didn't guess,
they're also from the slums.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.271
'Cause street rats
work better in packs!

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:42.230
[RYOMA]
Smart.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.649
And judging from the
giant ant carcass on your cart,

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.277
I take it you took up the
hunting part of the request.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:50.488
Uh-huh. We want their carapaces.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.698
That's their shell.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.491
What do you want those for?

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.035
Well, they make
for good equipment

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.870
and our big bro
is an armorsmith!

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.580
Or an apprentice to one,
at least.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.248
But he'll make us armor
and shields for cheap

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.208
if we bring him
enough materials!

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.668
Carapaces are lighter than metal

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.254
and studier than leather, too!

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.756
But it's slim pickin's.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.300
This is the only bounty
we could find.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:14.929
I wish we knew
where they were hiding.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.389
I know where a colony is,

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.100
so that wish is
about to come true.

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.103
See, I took on the
surveying part of the request.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.480
Are you for real?

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.357
I'm always for real when it
comes to helping those in need.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.987
Ya got yourself a deal!
Thank you!

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.530
You're welcome.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.203
I'm not seein' any colony.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.579
One second.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.627
Let's show 'em what happens
when you meddle with metal!

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:46.711
[BECK, FINIA, RUMILLE, RUTH]
Whoa.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:47.879
What are those things?

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.298
Dark ones are metal slimes
'n' lighter ones are iron.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.133
You have so many, though.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.552
[RYOMA] 'Cause they're all
gonna help find the colony.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.597
Stand back till I say when.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.767
Now, line up, guys!

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.771
[ALL 5]
Oh, wow.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.690
Advance,
but proceed with caution.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.906
Can they really help
find the colony?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.784
It's a safe bet since slimes
are good at sensing danger.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.160
Just watch.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.518
Nice attack!

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.311
[RYOMA]
Okay. Your turn.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.980
[ALL 5]
Huh?!

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.568
Hunting the ants is
the job you all took on.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.487
I'll act as backup if you need
me, but I doubt you will.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:57.031
Oh, right! Show no mercy!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.830
[RYOMA] I shouldn't
do their work for them.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.331
They won't learn that way.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.510
[yells]

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:26.895
Are you ready?

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.938
Yeah, we'll take it
out together!

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.403
Go away! As in right now!

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.449
[RUTH, RUMILLE]
We did it!

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.409
They're doing an awesome job!

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.036
But then,
I can't simply sit around

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:45.246
when I also have a job to do.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.917
Earth Needle attack!

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.131
Okay, let's head
to the next colony!

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.217
Right on!
You just lead the way, Ryoma!

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:02.388
[ELISE hums]
Long time no see.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.854
[ELISE]
Stare!

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.069
That should be good. Yeah.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.445
--[BECK] Ryoma.
--Huh?

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.490
Need help with the cart?

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.741
[BECK]
Nah, it's just getting late.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:22.992
Let's head back.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.827
Did you collect
enough materials?

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.664
Uh-huh!
This is way more than enough!

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:31.042
Besides, this load is all
that our little cart can handle.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.377
[chuckles]

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:38.800
[WIST]
All five of us should be able

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.969
to have armor made
with this haul!

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.805
And that wouldn't be
possible without you, Ryoma.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.182
[FINIA] Thank you
for helping us find the ants.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.101
There's no need to thank me.

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:50.728
The hard part was the fighting,
and that was all you guys.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.647
But anytime we
got in over our heads,

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.482
you and your slimes
came to our rescue.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:55.358
So, thanks!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.485
Fighting aside, we wouldn't
have made half the kills we did

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.195
if you hadn't
found the colonies!

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.905
You were like our compass!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.156
And we're gonna
get oodles of money

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.285
because of how many ants
we managed to slay!

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.662
Now we can really enjoy
the Foundation Fest!

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:08.788
It'll be great!

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.873
We won't have that
much money left over.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.751
Even with our discount, five
full sets of armor is expensive.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.461
Then tomorrow
we'll go hunt again!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:18.631
We'll make twice as much if we
snag as many as we did today!

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.841
Were you not listening?

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.760
We thanked Ryoma 'cause
he's the reason we did so well.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.763
Without him, we won't even
find the colonies. You know?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.390
Well, he can come,
too, of course!

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.309
Hey, stop being
so selfish, will ya?!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.435
Whatever.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.604
Sorry. You can forget
everything she said, Ryoma.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.398
I'm sure you're
busy tomorrow, right?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.275
Yes. Very much so.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:40.403
I'm running a festival stall
and I have to prep.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.946
Ah! I have an idea!

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.038
Is he really still out
adventuring?

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.414
Hi, Mister Callum.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.498
Hello, and welcome back.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.624
Huh?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.794
Who are all of
these kids with you, sir?

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.629
Fellow adventurers
I happened to run into

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.131
when I was out on my job.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.299
Think they could
be the part-timers

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.925
we hire for the stall?

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.260
Hmm...

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.183
[DOLCE]
Beck?

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:11.017
Huh?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.977
[BECK]
Mister Dolce!

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.480
[CALLUM]
So then you know these children?

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.356
Oh, yeah.

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.858
I look in on these guttersnipes
sometimes. They're great.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.485
[CALLUM]
That's convenient.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.236
Makes my choice easy.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.655
Since both you and
Mister Dolce can vouch for them,

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.032
I don't see an issue.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:29.577
Hello, I'm Callum, the
assistant manager of this shop.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:30.453
It's a pleasure.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.954
Consider yourselves hired.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.581
[ALL 5]
Ah!

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:35.958
We promise we
won't let you down, sir!

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.253
Anyways, do you think it
would be appropriate for them

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.631
to join the party tonight,
Mister Callum?

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.257
Since they're our new staff?

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.635
Yes. It is a welcome party.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:46.594
[ALL 5 gasp]

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:47.637
You sure about that?

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:49.889
You met us, like,
20 seconds ago.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.265
I assure you it's fine.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.768
We have plenty of extra
food prepared anyway.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.686
And besides, the whole point
was for everyone

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:58.439
working the festival
to get to know each other.

00:14:58.481 --> 00:14:59.315
Now that you're hired,

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.734
that "everyone,"
includes you, of course!

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:06.239
Oh, yeah. We can sort out
your wages at a later date.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.074
And, um, would you feel okay

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.660
acting as a kind of
chaperone, Mister Dolce?

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.746
Indeed. I'll introduce them
to the rest of the staff.

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:14.956
[RYOMA]
I appreciate it!

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.707
Shall we, Mister Callum?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:17.959
We shall, Manager.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:18.793
Go ahead.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.504
It's time to get this
whole event underway.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.880
[RYOMA]
Hello and welcome!

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:26.801
I'm the manager of Bamboo
Forest, Ryoma Takebayashi.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:30.263
I'm so very thrilled about the
upcoming Foundation Festival,

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.014
which is why I'd like
to thank each of you

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:33.558
for being a part of it.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.059
So here's to working together,

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.937
making new friends,
and memories to last.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:38.771
Cheers, guys!

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.481
[EVERYONE]
Cheers!

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.277
Hope everyone came hungry.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.363
Tonight, we have some very
special food for you all.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.073
Please enjoy!

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:57.957
Those look tasty!

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.418
[PRENANCE] I must say,
this is quite the welcome.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.377
I thank you.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.628
I'm glad you approve.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.422
And how are you
liking the cuisine?

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.549
It's blown my expectations away!

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:07.758
I can confidently say that

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.886
on behalf of all my
troupe members, too!

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:11.679
Just see for yourself!

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:21.147
Please forgive and
forget my gluttonous niece.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.065
I'm Sordio. She's Maiya.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.860
If you've heard of our troupe's
sword dancers, that's us.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.111
No, I haven't.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.071
They're such a sight to behold!

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.782
They cut a rug, among
other things, with their swords!

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.160
And you know how every
festival has its fights?

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.622
If one breaks out, do yourself
a favor and call them.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.540
I'll try to keep that in mind.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.417
Always nice
to have people like you.

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:42.793
Now I feel reassured.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.712
Good, and he wasn't
just being polite,

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.923
so please call on Maiya or me
for anything you need.

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.758
Call on me for what? Seconds?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.928
No, dear, in case he needs some
extra security at his event.

00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:56.057
Oh, gotcha.
At your service, bossman, sir.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.561
Whoever catered
deserves a raise!

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:04.607
Shouldn't stop introductions to
give a food review, good grief.

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:07.151
Eating with such gusto
is a compliment!

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:10.696
That said, it might be a
good idea to save a little room.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.573
We haven't brought
out dessert yet!

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:14.367
What? Dessert?

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:18.037
How is that saving room?

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.038
[MAIYA]
S'gotta be room on my plate

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.831
before it gets to my stomach.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.416
[SORDIO]
Hmmm...

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.211
[BECK]
Hmm? What're these balls?

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.213
Semesa dumplings,
and they're good.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:28.714
You should try one!

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.554
Yummy!

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.388
[RUTH]
Mmm...

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:37.431
Wow! This is really good!

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.307
[RUMILLE]
Mmm!

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.643
I like the texture, too!

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.107
There's plenty more,
so eat your fill!

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:49.735
I see. How's such
a thing done, though?

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:53.573
[BECK] Ryoma, has anybody told
you how awesome you are today?

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.242
Well, it's not like
I do everything by myself.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.161
I'm only where I am today
because others supported me.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:00.997
They support you
'cause you're cool!

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:03.833
And one of the strongest
people I've ever seen!

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.627
[RUTH] You did take out those
tunnel ants with one attack.

00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:09.005
Uh, hey, so,
what's the big secret

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.173
behind your strength,
huh, Ryoma?

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.717
--Hmm?
--Hmm?

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.885
I'm curious what
made you think to ask.

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.430
It's 'cause, I, eh,

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.223
I was just wondering
what goes through your head

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.643
when you fight or
if you ever get scared.

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.313
[RYOMA]
Ah. That's right.

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.277
Bingo.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.154
Man, I hate it when
you act like a wimp.

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.865
Oh, sorry.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.658
But, yeah, do you?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.869
Well, let's see.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.872
I really don't give myself time
to be afraid in a fight.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:46.000
Too busy concentrating
on what my next move'll be.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.460
That's really all it is?

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:48.878
But don't let it get you down!

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.588
After enough training
and experience,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.507
I just know you'll overcome
all your fears eventually!

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.301
Hard work is key, though!

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.219
It also doesn't hurt to
have a great group of friends

00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.596
who will have your back.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:18:59.597
[gasps]

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.682
And that's an indisputable fact!

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.809
We'll always
be here for you, pal.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:04.810
Always.

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.063
The same way
you're there for us!

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.898
Mm. Right.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:16.530
Sorry 'bout that.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:18.991
If I could've given you
a heads up, I would've.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.618
It's fine. I'm the
one who asked you

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.953
to hire more staff
for the festival.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.830
Thank you for
delivering so quickly.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:27.792
Efficient as always, sir.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.210
You know what, though?

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:30.336
[RYOMA]
Hmm?

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:34.006
[CALLUM] Our little shop has
grown by leaps and bounds.

00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:36.842
Back when my sister
and I first arrived here,

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:40.012
I never dreamed I'd be working
with so many people.

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:42.807
Or that they'd be so wonderful.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.684
[RYOMA]
Yeah.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.186
We've grown into something good.

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:51.607
Dear Lady Eliaria Jamil,

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.818
we held a party to better
acquaint my staff

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.028
with the troupe performing
here for the festival,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.489
and it went off without a hitch!

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.700
The big turnout made me
realize how many people

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.203
I have in my life
that I consider friends.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.955
You're one of
those dear friends,

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.540
which is why I hope
you'll make your own

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:10.418
party-sized group of
schoolmates at the academy.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:12.753
I know you're worried,
but you've got this!

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.255
Trust me.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.884
[RYOMA]
I'll be rooting for you, Elia!

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.391
All right!
Guess this is goodbye!

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.017
Before you go, Elia,

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.645
promise me you'll send a letter
if anything happens, okay?

00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:31.939
Wait. Just send me
letters regardless!

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.566
One a day, if you want to!

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:35.985
Though this is quite endearing,
you're worrying her.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.528
And she doesn't need that.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.156
In fact, she's the one
who's acting like an adult.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:41.240
At least, right now.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.451
[sighs] Have a heart, Dad.

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.827
[BOTH chuckle]

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.829
[ELIARIA giggles]

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:50.833
Finally, there's that
gorgeous smile once again.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.209
A sweet parting gift.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.669
Brilliantly done, my darling!

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.088
You said all of that just
to make her smile!

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.424
Um... Yes, that was the plan.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.633
Glad you caught on.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.802
Was that honestly your plan?

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:04.847
Ahem! Well, anyway,

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.182
have a safe journey.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:07.516
Enjoy your new school.

00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:08.559
Please do!

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:11.687
We know you'll study hard, but
try and have a little fun, too.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.605
That's right.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.857
And though being the
duke's daughter has its perks,

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:17.651
you might attract some
unwanted attention, my dear.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.779
But I'm sure you'll
handle it with ease.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.821
Agreed.

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.991
My lady is a remarkable
judge of character, is she not?

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.911
Which is why none of us
have anything to worry about.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.996
I think she's become
quite capable.

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.207
[ELIARIA]
Mm-hmm!

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.333
Mm.

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.713
Get going while the day's young.

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:38.672
Okay then!

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:41.383
Without further ado,
I'm headed off to the academy!

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:42.676
[ALL 3]
Mm.

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.641
[REINHART]
Hughes. Camil.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.392
We're counting on you!

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:16.126
[ELIARIA]
I'll do my best!

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:17.837
Just like Mister Ryoma!
