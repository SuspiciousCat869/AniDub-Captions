MIKIO SHIRATO!

THESE TWO TOP‐RANKED FIGHTERS,

EACH CONSIDERED A FAVORITE
FOR ENTRY INTO MEGALONIA,

00:02:53.613 --> 00:02:56.580

DOESN'T SHIRATO OWN MEGALONIA?

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.286
IF MIKIO WINS HIS NEXT FIGHT,

00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:33.086

I DOUBT THE GENERAL PUBLIC
WOULD ACCEPT THAT.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.093
MY SOURCES TELL ME
ARAGAKI WAS QUITE BRUTAL.

00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:06.826

EVEN SUGER'S SWITCH‐UPS DON'T
SEEM TO DO A DAMN BIT OF GOOD.

THE MOST ENERGY‐EFFECTIVE
ATTACKS AND DEFENSES,

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:57.000
AGAINST A FIGHTER LIKE SUGER,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.033

I HAVE A TICKET TO MEGALONIA?

WELL, I WISH IT DID,

00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:21.240

I NEED TO DO.

SOME CAGED DOG, SO‐‐

WE FINALLY MADE IT!

TRULY CLAIM THAT LAST SPOT,

THERE'S ONE FIGHTER OUT THERE
I SIMPLY CAN'T IGNORE.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.273
"GEARLESS" JOE, WHICH ONE OF US

00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:47.140
SHOULD MOVE ON
TO COMPETE IN MEGALONIA?

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.406
LET'S MEET IN THIS RING
AND FIND OUT.

( Joe sighs )

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.806
Nanbu: THE THING ABOUT LUCK
IS THAT YOU NEVER SEE IT COMING.

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:55.806
AND TO THINK,
TEAM NOWHERE HAS MANAGED

00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:58.140
TO MAKE IT ALL THIS WAY
ON A FAKE I. D.

IT MAY AS WELL
BE THE REAL THING NOW.

SEEM TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?

THIS IS SHIRATO
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:12.080
I CAN'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING SUSPICIOUS.

00:07:13.046 --> 00:07:14.713
BUT NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF TRAP

00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:16.646
THEY'RE TRYING
TO SNARE YOU IN...

00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:19.513
ONCE WE GET IN THE RING,

00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:21.446
WE'VE GOT THE ADVANTAGE.

00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:22.846

00:07:22.846 --> 00:07:24.380
I MEAN, YEAH, SURE,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.880
HIS GEAR IS SUPER HIGH‐TECH
AND EVERYTHING,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.346
BUT POPS AND I HAVE SEEN YOU

00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:30.780
GET STRONGER AND STRONGER
WITH EVERY FIGHT.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.746
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'LL LOSE.
I JUST KNOW IT.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.846
( Joe chuckles ) IN THAT CASE,

00:07:37.846 --> 00:07:39.846
I SHOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE,
LOAFING AROUND.

00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:41.080
Nanbu:
YES, YOU SHOULD, DUMB‐ASS.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.280
YOU'RE IN NO SHAPE TO TRAIN YET.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.213

Sachio: HOLY CRAP.

00:08:00.953 --> 00:08:04.620
Nanbu: YOU'VE FOUGHT NONSTOP
IN A SHORT TIME FRAME,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.920
AND I THINK THAT MATCH
AGAINST ARAGAKI

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.586
PUSHED YOU TO YOUR LIMIT.

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:10.186
Joe: IT ISN'T ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:12.920
A COUPLE BRUISES HERE AND THERE
SHOULDN'T SLOW ME DOWN.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.920
Nanbu:
YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.153
YOU'RE EXPOSED
WHEN YOU GET IN THE RING,

00:08:17.153 --> 00:08:19.920
AND THAT MAKES EVERY ONE
OF THOSE BRUISES

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.020
AN OBVIOUS TARGET
FOR THE OTHER GUY.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.353
IT'S LIKE SAYING,
"PLEASE HIT ME HERE.

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.086
IT'LL HURT LIKE HELL."

00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:27.686

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:32.786
LOOK, I'M NOT THAT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW,

00:08:32.786 --> 00:08:34.686
BUT I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:36.820
IF YOU'RE FULLY HEALED UP.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.720
GETTING ENOUGH REST
IS IMPORTANT.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.720
THAT'S PART OF YOUR JOB, TOO,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.153
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GONNA
WIN IT ALL AT MEGALONIA.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.286
( Sachio chuckles )

00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:49.353

00:08:49.353 --> 00:08:51.086
HUH? ( gasps )

00:08:57.686 --> 00:08:59.086
( grunts )

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.960
Promoter: DIRECTOR ASAMOTO,
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.393
ALLOWING A MATCH
BETWEEN THAT GEARLESS FIGHTER

00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:07.860
AND MIKIO, ARE YOU?

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.260
Asamoto: IS THAT A PROBLEM?

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.826
Promoter: WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:09:10.826 --> 00:09:13.260
BY BEATING SUGER R. HILL,
EVERYONE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.593
THAT MIKIO
SHOULD HAVE THE FINAL SHOT.

00:09:15.593 --> 00:09:17.460
HIS COMMENTS
COULD SIMPLY BE DISMISSED

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.660
AS A BIT OF LIP SERVICE, RIGHT?

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.793
Asamoto: CONSIDERING HE
SAID THEM IN THE RING,

00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:24.093
WE CAN'T VERY WELL PRETEND
THEY DON'T EXIST.

00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:26.460
Promoter #2: I UNDERSTAND,
BUT DIDN'T THE PRESIDENT

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.960
SET UP THE MATCH WITH SUGER

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.460
FULLY EXPECTING THAT MIKIO
WOULD SHOW OFF HIS SKILLS?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.126
I JUST DON'T SEE THE POINT

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:34.160
IN BOTHERING
TO TEST HIM ANY FURTHER.

00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:38.926
Promoter #3: I'M AFRAID
THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO AGREE.

00:09:38.926 --> 00:09:41.826
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE
IS TO MAKE SURE MEGALONIA,

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:45.593
ONE OF SHIRATO'S BIGGEST
VENTURES, IS A HUGE SUCCESS.

00:09:45.593 --> 00:09:47.460
THAT ALONE
SHOULD MAKE IT OBVIOUS

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.193
WHO THE LAST ENTRANT
OUGHT TO BE.

00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:52.293
I DOUBT THE FORMER PRESIDENT
WOULD EVER HESITATE SO MUCH

00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:54.860
OVER A DECISION LIKE THIS ONE.
EVERYONE AGREE?

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.666
Yukiko: IT IS THIS COMMITTEE
THAT SETS ALL THE RULES.

00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:05.800
HE IS PART
OF OUR CORPORATE FAMILY,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.633
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT,
HE'S MERELY A FIGHTER,

00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:11.166
SO WE HAVE NO REASON
TO ACCOMMODATE HIS WHIMS.

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:12.100
Promoter #1: YOU MEAN...

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.533
Yukiko: I HEAR AND UNDERSTAND
YOUR ARGUMENTS, GENTLEMEN.

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:22.600
I'LL INFORM YOU
OF MY DECISION SHORTLY.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.400
Asamoto: THE COMMITTEE SEEMS SET

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.466
ON MIKIO ENTERING
THE TOURNAMENT.

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:29.000
I DON'T THINK THE EXECUTIVES

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.966
ARE GOING TO TOLERATE
MUCH MORE STALLING.

00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:34.466
Yukiko: THE SUGER MATCH
DIDN'T GO AS EXPECTED.

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:36.400
Asamoto:
PERHAPS WE UNDERESTIMATED

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.800
HOW EFFECTIVE
MIKIO'S GEAR IS.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.100
TO THINK IT'S
ALREADY SO ADVANCED.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.966
Yukiko: YOU BELIEVE YURI'S
INTEGRATED GEAR IS INFERIOR?

00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:46.866
Asamoto: THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL.

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:49.066
HOWEVER, IT DOES SEEM THAT MIKIO

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:51.533
HAS MORE SUPPORT
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:53.666
IF HE'S ABLE
TO ENTER THE TOURNAMENT,

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:56.066
IT COULD DETER
OUR AGENDA FOR MEGALONIA.

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:02.140
Yukiko: IT APPEARS AS THOUGH
I'LL HAVE TO USE HIM

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.106
TO STOP MY BROTHER, AFTER ALL.

00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:05.573
Asamoto: SO IT SEEMS.

00:11:05.573 --> 00:11:07.473
IT WAS INTERESTING
THAT YOUR BROTHER

00:11:07.473 --> 00:11:09.306
SUGGESTED THE MATCH HIMSELF.

00:11:09.306 --> 00:11:11.473
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE POSSIBILITY

00:11:11.473 --> 00:11:13.673
THAT MIKIO HAS REALIZED
WHAT YOU'RE AFTER?

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.806
Yukiko: HONESTLY,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:26.440
( Nanbu sighs )

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.540
Yabunuma: WELL,
IT'S FINALLY HERE.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.706
TEAM SHIRATO HAS DELIVERED
AN OFFICIAL OFFER.

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:34.706
THE CONTRACT SIGNING
WILL TAKE PLACE VERY SOON.

00:11:34.706 --> 00:11:37.406
Nanbu: SO I GUESS
YOU WEREN'T FEEDING ME A LINE

00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:39.273
TO GET ME OFF YOUR BACK, HUH?

00:11:39.273 --> 00:11:40.706
( Yabunuma laughs ) NOT AT ALL.

00:11:40.706 --> 00:11:43.240
HONESTLY, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD A CHANCE IN HELL

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.706
AT GETTING IN TO MEGALONIA.

00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:48.306
GUESS THAT'S JUST
ONE MORE UPSET FOR YOU BOYS.

00:11:48.306 --> 00:11:50.273
YOU GOT THE LUCK OF THE DEVIL.

00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:52.173
Nanbu: MR. YABUNUMA,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW

00:11:52.173 --> 00:11:53.573
WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS DEAL.

00:11:54.906 --> 00:11:57.240
Yabunuma: HMM.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.406
I'M JUST A GO‐BETWEEN,

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:01.180
NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.280
I HAVE NO OPINION.

00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:05.880
Nanbu: YEAH, STUPID QUESTION.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.280
FORGET I ASKED IT.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.246
Yabunuma: LISTEN, NANBU.

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:15.046
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND.

00:12:15.046 --> 00:12:18.046
THE LADY AT THE TOP
DOESN'T WANT MIKIO SHIRATO

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:19.680
GETTING IN TO MEGALONIA.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.280
Nanbu: HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYIN' TO SAY?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.846
WHAT WOULD THIS MATCH
BE ABOUT? UH...

00:12:24.846 --> 00:12:28.446
YUKIKO SHIRATO WANTS TO KEEP HER
BROTHER OUT OF THE TOURNAMENT?

00:12:28.446 --> 00:12:29.746
Yabunuma: SOME THINK
SHE'S WORRIED

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:32.213
ABOUT THE APPEARANCE
OF AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

00:12:32.213 --> 00:12:33.646
I DON'T KNOW,

00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:37.546
BUT, EITHER WAY,
WATCH YOURSELVES.

00:12:41.513 --> 00:12:43.380
Doctor: THE UNION
BETWEEN HIS BODY AND THE GEAR

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.213
HAS EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS.

00:12:45.213 --> 00:12:46.680
Yukiko: I SEE.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.346
Doctor: IT'S PROVEN TO BE
INCREDIBLY ADAPTIVE.

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:51.080
YOU CAN HARDLY
CALL IT GEAR ANYMORE.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.613
IT'S PART OF HIS BODY NOW,

00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:55.046
AND THE GEAR
WOULDN'T HAVE COME THIS FAR

00:12:55.046 --> 00:12:56.746
WITHOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.220
Yukiko: RIGHT.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.553
( both grunting )

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.320
( Yuri chuckles )

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.586
Coach: NEXT FIGHTER UP!

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.420
( boxer groaning )

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:28.986
Coach: OKAY, YURI,
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.686
( glove straps crinkling )

00:13:36.853 --> 00:13:39.120
Yukiko: I'M STARTING
TO THINK THE WORD "DEFEAT"

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.120
COULD NEVER APPLY TO YOU.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.886
Yuri: WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RING,
ONLY TRUE SKILL WILL SURVIVE.

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.153
( Yukiko gasps )

00:13:48.153 --> 00:13:50.420
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.420
Asamoto: MS. SHIRATO.
PARDON THE INTRUSION,

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.320
BUT MIKIO HAS REQUESTED
YOU MEET HIM IN THE LAB.

00:14:07.393 --> 00:14:09.860
Yukiko: A NEW GEAR MODEL?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.493
Mikio: I DEVELOPED IT
TO BEAT THE CHAMPION,

00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:14.960
THOUGH IT'S NOT YET COMPLETE.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.526
♪

00:14:16.526 --> 00:14:18.093
Yukiko: HOW CAN
I HELP YOU, BROTHER?

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:19.260
WHAT IS IT YOU NEED?

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.460
Mikio: THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS,

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.593
THE MATCH WITH "GEARLESS" JOE.

00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:25.460
Yukiko: RIGHT.
IT'S WHAT YOU'D HOPED FOR.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.426
Mikio: THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE COY, SISTER.

00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:31.393
I KNOW YOU WERE BEHIND IT.

00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:33.793
YOU WANTED SUGER
TO PUT AN END TO THIS.

00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:35.960
THE FACT THAT YOU THOUGHT
I COULDN'T WIN

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.126
PAINS ME TO MY SOUL.

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:41.526
BUT NOW IT SEEMS YOUR
LITTLE PLAN HAS FALLEN THROUGH,

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:43.960
SO I EXPECT YOUR NEXT
MACHINATION WILL BE TO USE

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.460
THAT IRRITATING LITTLE STRAY
AGAINST ME. HOW TRANSPARENT.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.926
YOU NEVER WANTED ME
TO GET IN TO MEGALONIA, DID YOU?

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:54.560
SAME OLD SIS.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.860
YOU'LL DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING
TO HAVE YOUR WAY,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.066
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU STOLE
THE SHIRATO NAME FROM ME.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.533
Yukiko: AS YOU RECALL,

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:04.033
IT WAS GRANDFATHER
WHO CHOSE ME TO SUCCEED HIM.

00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.366
Mikio: AFTER YOUR MANIPULATIONS.

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:08.700
( chuckles ) IT'S FINE.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.666
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE,
YOU KNOW,

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:15.333
BUT THIS TIME,
I'LL BE THE ONE CHOSEN.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.500
Yukiko: YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.166
AS THOUGH YOUR VICTORY
IS GUARANTEED.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.666
Mikio: THANK YOU FOR
THIS ENLIGHTENING CHAT, YUKIKO.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.566
( Joe grunting )

00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:45.933
Bonjiri: COME ON, EVERYBODY!
STEP RIGHT UP!

00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:48.966
THERE'S NO COVER.
JUST STEP UP, BUY SOME SOUP,

00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:50.533
AND WATCH AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.766
Oicho: IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA EAT IT, THEN BEAT IT!

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:55.266
LIKE THEY SAY, NOTHING'S MORE
EXPENSIVE THAN SOMETHING FREE.

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:56.966
Santa: HEY, NO PICTURES!

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:59.300
JUST FOR THAT, YOU'RE GONNA
GO TO THE BACK OF THE LINE!

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.806
Joe: THEY RUN A TIGHT BUSINESS.

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:03.206
( Sachio laughs )

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:05.440
Nanbu: ANY BRUISES LEFT?

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.706
( Joe chuckles )

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:14.606
Nanbu: NOW, LISTEN.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.473
HERE'S A LITTLE
REFRESHER COURSE.

00:16:16.473 --> 00:16:17.940
AS YOU'RE ALREADY WELL AWARE,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.640
MOST GEAR REACTS TO
THE MOVEMENTS OF YOUR MUSCLES.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.006
BECAUSE OF THAT,
THERE'S A SLIGHT DELAY

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.406
WHEN COMPARED
TO A REGULAR PUNCH.

00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:27.106
THAT WOULD BE THE ADVANTAGE

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:29.273
YOU RISKED YOUR NECK
TO CAPITALIZE ON.

00:16:29.273 --> 00:16:31.440
Sachio: THAT'S TRUE,
BUT THE A. I.‐EQUIPPED MODEL

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.706
THAT MIKIO USES
HAS ADVANCED SENSORS

00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:35.740
DESIGNED TO DETECT
HIS OPPONENT'S MOVES.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.540
ONCE IT DOES,
THE GEAR TAKES OVER

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.240
AND MOVES HIS BODY FOR HIM,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.273
WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO LAG
TO HIS REACTIONS.

00:16:42.273 --> 00:16:43.740
Nanbu: YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.706
THE GEARLESS ADVANTAGE
THAT'S BEEN HELPING

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:47.540
ISN'T GONNA DO JACK
IN THIS NEXT MATCH.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.673
( Joe chuckles )
THEN I JUST GOTTA SHOW HIM

00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:51.073
I'VE GOT MORE THAN THAT.

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:52.573
Nanbu: DON'T BE STUPID.

00:16:52.573 --> 00:16:54.873
THIS GUY'S BEEN STUDYING
YOUR FIGHTING STYLE.

00:16:54.873 --> 00:16:57.273
HE KNOWS ALL YOUR MOVES.
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,

00:16:57.273 --> 00:16:58.473
YOU'LL END UP JUST LIKE SUGER.

00:16:58.473 --> 00:17:00.146
Joe: YEAH, SURE, WHATEVER.

00:17:00.146 --> 00:17:01.613
JUST GET IN YOUR STANCE.

00:17:01.613 --> 00:17:02.946
( Nanbu grumbles )

00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:04.213
WATCH IT.

00:17:04.213 --> 00:17:05.613
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S GET GOIN'.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.780
( groans )

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.580
HOLY SHIT, THAT WAS STRONG.

00:17:15.046 --> 00:17:17.180
( Joe grunting )

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.946
Sachio: I REMEMBER
YOU TELLING US BEFORE

00:17:23.946 --> 00:17:27.346
THAT HAVING STRONG FOOTING MAKES
FOR STRONGER PUNCHES, RIGHT?

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.880
SO WE TRIED
HELPING OUT WITH THAT.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.013
Joe: HIS GEAR MIGHT BE GOOD,
BUT IT WON'T SEE THIS COMING.

00:17:33.013 --> 00:17:34.346
WITH A SHOT LIKE THIS‐‐

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.880
‐ Nanbu: SACHIO!
‐ ( Sachio gasps )

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.980
Joe: HMM?

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.480
Sachio: SORRY, POPS.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.480
I KNOW YOU SAID JOE HAD TO REST,
BUT I JUST THOUGHT‐‐

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.980
( Nanbu sighs )
THAT'S NOT IT.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.446
Sachio: HUH?

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:48.046
Nanbu: WE'RE A TEAM,
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:50.080
IF YOU COME UP WITH IDEAS
THAT'LL HELP US

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.680
GET IN TO MEGALONIA,
THEN TRY 'EM OUT.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.080
HOWEVER,
DON'T SNEAK AROUND DOING IT

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.713
WITHOUT TELLING
THE REST OF US, ALL RIGHT?

00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:00.620
( Sachio grunts )

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.953
Joe: I'D SAY
OUR CHANCES IMPROVED.

00:18:02.953 --> 00:18:05.253
RIGHT, POPS? WHAT YOU THINK?

00:18:05.253 --> 00:18:08.986
Nanbu: YEAH, SURE, BUT EVEN IF
YOU HAVE A KILLER PUNCH,

00:18:08.986 --> 00:18:11.253
IT WON'T MATTER
IF YOU CAN'T LAND IT.

00:18:11.253 --> 00:18:13.786
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH
OF A DIFFERENCE IT'LL MAKE,

00:18:13.786 --> 00:18:16.320
BUT WE NEED TO TEACH YOU
SOME NEW COMBINATIONS.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.253
TAKE A SHOT
WHERE I HOLD THE MITTS.

00:18:18.253 --> 00:18:20.853
WE'RE GONNA DRILL YOU ON ALL
THE PATTERNS I CAN THINK OF.
