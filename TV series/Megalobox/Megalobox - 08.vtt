THE BATTLE TO DECIDE

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.333
WHO'D OBTAIN
THE FINAL TICKET TO MEGALONIA,

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.333
BUT MIKIO SHIRATO
VS. "GEARLESS" JOE

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.533
ENDED IN A WAY
NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.600
AS A RESULT,
THE GENERAL EXPECTATION

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.500
IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS
IS THAT MIKIO

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.100
WILL BE ANNOUNCED

AT THIS TIME, THERE HAS
BEEN NO CONFIRMED REASON

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.266
AS TO WHY JOE
FORFEITED THE MATCH.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.800
COULD IT HAVE BEEN BECAUSE HE‐‐

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.333
Fujimaki: I'M DISAPPOINTED,
COACH NANBU.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.033
YOU WERE JUST ONE STEP AWAY

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.600
FROM GETTING INTO MEGALONIA,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.100
AND THEN YOU RAN AWAY WITH
YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.366
Nanbu: THAT'S NOT IT.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.166
THAT SNAKE MIKIO SHIRATO
SET US UP.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.533
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.700
A PROBLEM WITH REPERCUSSIONS.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.606

JUST SOME LITTLE KIDS'S GAME

Fujimaki: ALL I WANT TO KNOW

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:09.539
IS IF THIS LITTLE GAMBLE
OF YOURS IS OVER.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.306
Nanbu: IT'S NOT...

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:17.873

Sachio: JOE, POPS HEARD
WHAT FUJIMAKI SAID, TOO.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:04.220
THOSE STUPID JERKS AT SHIRATO
WEREN'T GONNA LET US IN

TO MEGALONIA
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:08.653
Joe: YOU KNOW, WE WOULDN'T
EVEN BE IN THIS MESS

00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:11.253
IF YOU HAD JUST STAYED
THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY!

WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE?!

YOU ARE THE ONE WHO FORGOT, JOE.

Joe: HUH?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.553

BECAUSE YOU WERE
HOT UNDER THE COLLAR,

HE KNEW ALL ABOUT
YOUR COUNTERFEIT I. D.,

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:36.020
ALONG WITH ALL THOSE UNDERGROUND
MATCHES WE USED TO THROW.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.353
THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:39.486
IF SHIRATO
WANTED TO GET RID OF US,

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.920
HE COULD HAVE JUST GONE PUBLIC
WITH WHAT HE KNEW.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.786
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS EASY
AS A PHONE CALL.

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:46.086
BUT HE DIDN'T.

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:49.086
INSTEAD, HE WENT THROUGH
THE TROUBLE TO SCARE US OFF.

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:50.886
HE DID IT HIMSELF, TOO.

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:52.353

A REASON HE WANTS JOE GONE,

SHARING IT WITH ANYBODY.

JUST FIND OUT WHY...

BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

PLEASE HELP, MR. FUJIMAKI!

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:15.160
IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT MIKIO SHIRATO'S UP TO,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.760
I'M SURE WE CAN USE
THAT INFORMATION AS LEVERAGE

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.460
TO FORCE HIM
BACK INTO THE RING.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.260
Fujimaki: SO YOU HAVEN'T
GIVEN UP THEN, I TAKE IT?

Sachio: HELL, NO, WE HAVEN'T!

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.660
WE PROMISED EACH OTHER,
NO MATTER WHAT,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.226
THAT WE'D TAKE THIS
ALL THE WAY TO MEGALONIA!

THIS WAS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:39.326
SOMEONE SHOWED UP
IN THE UNDERGROUND

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:43.060
SNIFFING AROUND FOR WHATEVER
THEY COULD FIND OUT ABOUT JOE.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.326
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT GRABBED THEIR INTEREST

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.426
WAS THAT I. D. NATURALLY,
AND THEY SAW SOME SIGNS

00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:50.226
THAT IT MAY HAVE
BEEN TAMPERED WITH.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.860
Fujimaki: BUT THAT'S
AS FAR AS IT WENT.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.526
SEE, ME AND MY CREW
ARE PROFESSIONALS

00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:00.060
WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING
WITH THIS SORT OF THING.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.700
SOMEONE POKING THEIR NOSE AROUND
IN THE DATABASE

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.400
ISN'T GONNA UNDERMINE
OUR BUSINESS.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.233
THEY'D HAVE TO CLOSELY
EXAMINE THE I. D. ITSELF

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:09.400
‐ TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN.
‐ Nanbu: YOU MEAN,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.066
THIS STUFF ABOUT HIM
KNOWING JOE'S PAST...

00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:14.133

OF PEOPLE IN THE UNDERGROUND

GRUMBLING ABOUT WHAT THE TWO
OF YOU HAVE MANAGED TO PULL OFF.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:19.933
I FIGURE SOME LOWLIFES SAW
A CHANCE TO MAKE SOME QUICK CASH

00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:23.200
AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT THINGS
THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.766
MIKIO SHIRATO MAY HAVE A HUNCH,

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:27.700

ANY SOLID EVIDENCE.

THE INFO YOU NEED,

BUT THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.
GOT IT?

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:47.233

00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:49.833
AND THE BOY HERE'S
GONNA BE PAYING FOR IT, TOO.

JUST SOME BOY, OKAY?

I'M WITH TEAM NOWHERE.
MY NAME'S SACHIO!

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:57.366
AND IF YOUR INFO
TURNS OUT TO BE BULLSHIT,

WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR IT!

HIS NAME'S KOICHI MIZUHARA.

00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:11.406

DOING VARIOUS TYPES
OF GEAR DEVELOPMENT FOR SHIRATO

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:16.706
UP UNTIL ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.173
APPARENTLY,
OUR KOICHI GOT CAUGHT

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.673
STEALING PARTS
AND SELLING THEM.

00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:27.373
NOW HE'S WASHED UP, ONE OF
OUR REGULARS AT THE FIGHTS.

00:06:27.373 --> 00:06:30.940
HE FELL SO HARD,
HE'S GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

I THINK IF WE USED
THE RIGHT INCENTIVE,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.873
WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING GOOD
OUT OF HIM.

BROUGHT ME ONBOARD,

MORE LIKE LAB ASSISTANTS,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.993
AND ALL
THE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT

00:09:31.993 --> 00:09:34.693
WAS HANDLED
BY INTERNAL SHIRATO PEOPLE.

00:09:34.693 --> 00:09:37.726
THEY'D MAKE A PROTOTYPE
AND THEN IMPROVE ON IT.

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:41.060
FOR A FEW MONTHS, THEY KEPT
REPEATING THAT PROCESS.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.226
THEN ONE DAY,
WITHOUT MUCH WARNING AT ALL,

00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:44.826
THE PROJECT WAS ENDED.

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:46.860
Nanbu: WHAT HAPPENED?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.060
Koichi: IT WASN'T
NECESSARY ANYMORE.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.960
THE NEXT‐GEN GEAR THEY WERE
PUSHING FOR WAS FINISHED.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.926
Nanbu: AND THAT WOULD BE YURI'S
INTEGRATED MODEL. IS THAT RIGHT?

00:09:55.926 --> 00:09:58.926
Koichi: YEAH,
IN THE END, AT LEAST.

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.600
THERE WAS ACTUALLY
ANOTHER CANDIDATE

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.466
FOR THE NEXT‐GEN MODEL, YOU SEE.

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:06.433
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE ULTIMATE
EVOLUTION OF MOUNTED MODELS.

00:10:06.433 --> 00:10:07.833
THAT'S THE VERSION
THAT WAS LOADED

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:10.133
‐ WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
‐ Nanbu: HUH?

00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:11.900
Koichi: BUT IT WASN'T LONG

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.700
BEFORE ITS DEVELOPMENT
WAS CANCELED,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.766
AND THE INTEGRATED MODEL
WAS OFFICIALLY CHOSEN.

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:19.300
THE STORY WAS
THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY DEFECTS

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.966
IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS,
BUT THE THING IS,

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:24.266
THE INTEGRATED MODEL
THAT WON OUT WAS PUT TOGETHER

00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:27.333
BY THE PRESIDENT'S SPECIALLY
SELECTED DEVELOPMENT TEAM,

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:28.933
SO A LOT OF US WONDERED,

00:10:28.933 --> 00:10:32.066
"IS THIS A REAL RACE OR
SOME INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE?"

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:35.333
Nanbu: AND THE ONE WHO DEVELOPED
THE A. I.‐EQUIPPED MODEL

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.000
WAS MIKIO SHIRATO?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.333
Koichi: YEAH.

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:40.700
Yabunuma: LISTEN.
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.166
THE LADY AT THE TOP
DOESN'T WANT MIKIO SHIRATO

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:45.300
GETTING IN TO MEGALONIA.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.066
Mikio: NO ONE'S
GETTING IN MY WAY,

00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:52.333
NO STRAY DOG
AND NO WOMAN, EITHER.

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:54.366
Nanbu: I GET IT NOW.

00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:57.400
THE SHIRATO SIBLINGS
AREN'T EXACTLY A UNITED FRONT.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.873
Sachio: HIS OWN PET
A.I. PROJECT, A. C. E., OR ACE.

00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:06.773
MIKIO WANTS TO GET IN
TO MEGALONIA AND BEAT YURI

00:11:06.773 --> 00:11:10.540
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,
ALL TO PROVE JUST ONE THING,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.206
THAT HIS GEAR,
WITHOUT A DOUBT, IS THE BEST.

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:14.740
( Mikio grunting )

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.506
Sachio: HE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO ACHIEVE THAT.

00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:19.373
Joe: GOOD TO KNOW,
BUT THAT CAN'T BE ALL THERE IS.

00:11:19.373 --> 00:11:23.873
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T EVEN
WANT US TO STEP INTO THE RING.

00:11:23.873 --> 00:11:26.973
Koichi: MIKIO'S SHIRATO GEAR?

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:28.606
GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN.

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:31.406
LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW, OKAY?

00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:34.340
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT OUT OF ME?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.806
Nanbu: LISTEN.
THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

00:11:36.806 --> 00:11:39.606
THE CEREMONY'S
ONLY A FEW HOURS AWAY.

00:11:39.606 --> 00:11:42.373
IF WE CAN GET SOME KIND
OF LEVERAGE ON THE SITUATION

00:11:42.373 --> 00:11:43.773
THAT WOULD FORCE HIM
INTO THE RING,

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.606
I KNOW DAMN WELL
JOE CAN BEAT HIM.

00:11:45.606 --> 00:11:47.373
Koichi: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.906
‐ Nanbu: HUH?
‐ Koichi: LOOK, MISTER,

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:51.106
ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT HIS A.I.

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:53.773
DOESN'T HAVE ANY WEAKNESSES.
HE'S DAMN NEAR INVINCIBLE.

00:11:53.773 --> 00:11:56.540
I MEAN, YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.606
THE SENSORS DETECT
EVERY SINGLE MOVEMENT

00:11:58.606 --> 00:12:01.513
MADE IN THE OPPONENT'S GEAR,
THEN AUTOMATICALLY PICKS

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.413
THE PERFECT COUNTERMEASURE
FOR THEM.

00:12:03.413 --> 00:12:05.113
HOW COULD ANYBODY
BEAT A MONSTER LIKE THAT?

00:12:05.113 --> 00:12:06.513
Nanbu: HUH?

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.113
( Koichi gasping )

00:12:09.113 --> 00:12:11.013
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

00:12:18.213 --> 00:12:19.680
Nanbu: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.580
Koichi: WHATEVER IT WAS,
I'M SORRY.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.846
LOOK, I'M SURE YOU GUYS
CAN TAKE HIM.

00:12:23.846 --> 00:12:27.080
Nanbu: THE SENSORS. YOU SAID
THE SENSORS WERE MONITORING...

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.546
Koichi: TH‐THE GEAR.

00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:31.580
THE SENSORS PICK UP EVEN
THE FAINTEST ELECTRICAL SIGNALS

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.513
FROM HIS OPPONENT'S GEAR.

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:35.580
Nanbu: BUT THAT'D MEAN...

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.613
THE SENSORS ARE DETECTING MOVES

00:12:37.613 --> 00:12:39.946
FROM THE OTHER GUY'S GEAR.

00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:41.313
IN OTHER WORDS...

00:12:41.313 --> 00:12:45.446
Sachio: MIKIO'S ACE CAN'T
PREDICT A FIGHTER WITHOUT GEAR.

00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:47.680
HE'S STRAIGHT‐UP
AFRAID OF YOU, JOE.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.913
HE DIDN'T WANT TO FACE A FIGHTER
THAT DOESN'T WEAR GEAR.

00:12:51.913 --> 00:12:54.880
I WOULD HAVE NEVER GUESSED,
BUT NOW WE GOT AN EDGE.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.480
WE CAN DO THIS.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.146
IT HASN'T BEEN ANNOUNCED YET,

00:12:58.146 --> 00:13:01.286
BUT POPS SAID THE CEREMONY
WAS GONNA BE CALLED OFF TONIGHT.

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:03.953
WE'VE GOT THIS. WE'RE IN.

00:13:03.953 --> 00:13:05.653
( Mikio panting )

00:13:10.786 --> 00:13:14.053
Fujimaki: SO WHAT
WILL YOU DO NOW?

00:13:14.053 --> 00:13:16.253
Nanbu: WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.753
WHO WANT TO TAKE
MIKIO SHIRATO DOWN.

00:13:18.753 --> 00:13:21.753
YOUR ENEMY'S ENEMY
IS A FRIEND, RIGHT?

00:13:21.753 --> 00:13:22.786
Fujimaki: NANBU.

00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:23.920
REMEMBER,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.120
PEOPLE CAN'T CHANGE
THEIR TRUE NATURE.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.320
YOU CAN LEAVE THE UNDERGROUND,
EVEN MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.186
BUT YOU'LL STILL BE A SCORPION.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:34.320
YOU REALIZE THERE'S A LIMIT
TO HOW FAR YOU CAN GO, RIGHT?

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.986
Yukiko: NO. I REFUSE.

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:44.886
( Nanbu gasps )

00:13:44.886 --> 00:13:46.686
YOU WHAT? DID YOU‐‐

00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:49.420
WERE YOU LISTENING
TO EVERYTHING I JUST SAID?

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.986
Yukiko: YES. I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE EXPLAINING

00:13:51.986 --> 00:13:53.486
WHY YOU ABANDONED THE FIGHT,

00:13:53.486 --> 00:13:55.886
BUT INSTEAD YOU WANT
TO APPEAL FOR A REMATCH?

00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:58.420
Nanbu: I‐‐
BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.526
JOE CAN TAKE HIM.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

00:14:00.526 --> 00:14:02.093
IF YOU MAKE THIS MATCH HAPPEN,

00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:04.793
WE'LL BE REMOVING YOUR ENEMY
FOR YOU. WE BOTH WIN.

00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:07.960
Yukiko: I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
ANYONE WHO RUNS FROM THE RING.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960
WE'RE FINISHED HERE.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.426
Nanbu: WAIT A SECOND!

00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:12.726
THAT WAS
BECAUSE OF MIKIO'S TRAP.

00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:15.393
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

00:14:15.393 --> 00:14:17.360
THAT WHOLE MATCH WAS
ALL JUST A STUPID SETUP.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360
AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.060
YOU WERE USING JOE AND SUGER

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.593
TO KEEP YOUR BROTHER
FROM GETTING IN TO MEGALONIA.

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:25.760
YOU DRAGGED US INTO THIS FEUD.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.593
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
TURN YOUR BACK ON US NOW?

00:14:27.593 --> 00:14:29.093
Yukiko: LET'S SAY FOR A MOMENT

00:14:29.093 --> 00:14:31.926
THAT YOUR ACCUSATIONS
ABOUT MY BROTHER ARE TRUE.

00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:34.860
WHY DID YOU ACCEDE
TO HIS DEMANDS AND BACK DOWN?

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.160
( Nanbu shuddering )

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.560
Yukiko: IF THERE'S A GOOD REASON

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.393
YOU'RE REFUSING
TO EXPLAIN TO ME,

00:14:39.393 --> 00:14:41.460
I CAN HARDLY TRUST YOU
ABOUT ANYTHING.

00:14:43.093 --> 00:14:47.826
AND DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE I'D
PUT FAITH IN A GEARLESS BOXER?

00:14:47.826 --> 00:14:52.060
I HAVE YURI IN MY CORNER.
I'VE NO NEED FOR JOE.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.660
( hand scraping )

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.566
Sachio: EH?

00:15:02.566 --> 00:15:04.500
EVERYTHING'LL BE JUST FINE.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.400
I'M SURE POPS CAN
TAKE CARE OF WHATEVER‐‐

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.833
Joe: MIKIO WAS
NEVER INTIMIDATED BY ME.

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:09.500
Sachio: EH?

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.100
Joe: I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.700
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW HE SAW ME.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.933
AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED,
I WASN'T WORTH FIGHTING.

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:18.300
HE SAW ME AS INFERIOR.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.966
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:25.300
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:28.566
( Sachio sighs )

00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:30.200
Yukiko: IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.700
I HAVE A CEREMONY
TO PREPARE FOR.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.233
Nanbu: LOOK, I GET IT,

00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:37.800
AND I KNEW
WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF US

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.400
LONG BEFORE I WALKED IN THAT
DOOR TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.100
I WAS FULLY PREPARED
FOR THIS KIND OF ANSWER,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.566
BUT, DAMN IT, WE'VE COME WAY
THE HELL TOO FAR TO BACK DOWN.

00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:53.900
MIKIO MANAGED TO DIG UP
SOME THINGS IN OUR PAST

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.766
THAT WE CAN'T LET
SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY.

00:15:55.766 --> 00:15:57.433
THAT'S WHAT
HE THREATENED US WITH.

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:59.500
HE WANTED US TO ACT
LIKE WE'D LOST.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.340
JOE'S I. D. CARD IS THE PROOF.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.640
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE ME OR NOT

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.373
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT
THE MATCH BETWEEN MIKIO AND JOE

00:16:06.373 --> 00:16:08.273
WAS A SETUP, START TO FINISH.

00:16:08.273 --> 00:16:11.040
IT WAS A FIXED FIGHT, 100%.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.406
AND IF AFTER ALL THIS,

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:13.940
YOU STILL
DON'T ARRANGE A REMATCH,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.506
THEN I'LL GO PUBLIC WITH IT.
WHEN WORD GETS OUT

00:16:16.506 --> 00:16:18.706
THAT THE LAST SLOT
WAS FILLED BY CHEATING,

00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:21.273
BAD PRESS WILL BE
THE LEAST OF YOUR WORRIES.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.040
IF WE GO DOWN, IT ALL GOES DOWN,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.573
MEGALONIA, YOU, EVERYTHING!

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:29.673
Yukiko: AND YOU EXPECT ME
TO TRUST YOU AFTER THIS?

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:32.973
Nanbu: NO, NOT ME.
YOU JUST NEED TO TRUST JOE.

00:16:32.973 --> 00:16:36.706
THE FIGHTS HE'S WON TO GET HERE
WERE ALL ABOVEBOARD.

00:16:36.706 --> 00:16:39.373
HE'S THE REAL DEAL,
THE GENUINE ARTICLE.

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:42.473
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A SINGLE CHANCE,

00:16:42.473 --> 00:16:43.906
A CHANCE TO SHOW EVERYBODY

00:16:43.906 --> 00:16:47.073
THAT JOE'S ONE HELL OF A BOXER
WITH TRUE SKILL.

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:51.640
Yuri: WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RING,
ONLY TRUE SKILL WILL SURVIVE.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.473
Nanbu: PLEASE!
THIS IS OUR ONLY SHOT!

00:16:53.473 --> 00:16:55.506
CANCEL TONIGHT'S CEREMONY.

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:57.940
PUT JOE AND MIKIO
IN THE RING TOGETHER.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.880
JUST LET 'EM FIGHT!

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.446

STAY HERE UNTIL IT'S COMPLETE.

00:17:14.146 --> 00:17:15.713
Nanbu: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:17:15.713 --> 00:17:16.780

Sachio: COME ON, POPS.

( crowd murmuring )

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.133
Joe: ME AND MIKIO,

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:15.966
WE'VE GOT
SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS

00:20:15.966 --> 00:20:17.566
WE NEED TO SETTLE IN THAT RING!

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:18.866
Mikio: BUT IT IS OVER.

00:20:18.866 --> 00:20:21.833
COWARDS LIKE YOU
AREN'T GRANTED REQUESTS.

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:25.166
AS I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE,
"GEARLESS" JOE,

00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.733
STRAY DOGS SUCH AS YOURSELF
AREN'T ALLOWED HERE.

00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:31.266
FOR MEGALONIA, ONLY THOSE WITH
TRUE SKILL MAY ENTER THE RING.

00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:33.800
Yukiko: "WITH TRUE SKILL."

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.433
Mikio: TAKE HIM AWAY.

00:20:35.433 --> 00:20:37.000
( Joe grunting )

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.500
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?!

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.900
YOU THINK HE'S GOT
"TRUE SKILL?!"

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.733
Yukiko: A MOMENT, PLEASE.

00:20:44.733 --> 00:20:46.900
‐ Mikio: HMM?
‐ ( all gasp )

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.833
Yukiko: I'M SURE WE'RE
ALL A BIT SURPRISED,

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.066
BUT THIS KIND OF BOLD MOVE

00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:53.800
IS VERY MUCH WHAT WE'VE
COME TO EXPECT FROM JOE.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.600
‐ ( crowd laughs )
‐ Man: THAT JOE.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.866
Yukiko: REGARDING THE RESULTS
OF LAST NIGHT'S MATCH,

00:20:57.866 --> 00:21:00.940
I'M FULLY AWARE THAT THERE
HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.106
AS TO THE TRUE CAUSE.

00:21:02.106 --> 00:21:04.373
HOWEVER,
WHATEVER THE TRUTH MAY BE,

00:21:04.373 --> 00:21:06.873
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

00:21:06.873 --> 00:21:10.240
LIKE MIKIO SHIRATO JUST SAID,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.540
ONLY THOSE WITH TRUE SKILL
ARE WELCOME.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.240
AND FOR MEGALONIA, THAT CLAIM
MUST BE BEYOND DISPUTE.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.306
I DISPUTE WINNING BY DEFAULT.

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:20.773
( Mikio gasps )

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.406
( crowd gasping )

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.773
Joe: HEH.
JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.

00:21:33.273 --> 00:21:36.473
Yukiko: KEEP IN MIND THIS
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I TRUST YOU.

00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:38.073
Joe: THAT'S FINE BY ME.

00:21:41.006 --> 00:21:43.840
Yukiko: I FINALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT GRANDFATHER WANTED.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.473
I KNOW WHY I WAS CHOSEN.

00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:47.973
I'M ALSO THE ONE
WHO MAKES THE RULES HERE.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:51.940
THIS WILL BE YOUR LAST CHANCE,
MY DEAR BROTHER.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.540
( Mikio chuckles )

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.340
I THINK YOU'VE SHOWN YOUR
TRUE COLORS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:21:58.973 --> 00:22:01.313
AS OF NOW, ALL I HAVE

00:22:01.313 --> 00:22:03.313
WILL BE DEVOTED
TO DESTROYING YOU.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.113
Yukiko: I HEREBY MAKE
THIS MEGALONIA ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:22:09.113 --> 00:22:11.280
THE FINAL ENTRANT WILL BE
THE WINNER OF THE REMATCH

AND "GEARLESS" JOE.

( chuckles )

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.546
HE PULLED IT OFF!
