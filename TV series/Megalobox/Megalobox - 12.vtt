00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.773

HE HAS TRUE SKILL.

00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:28.773
Asamoto: THESE FINDINGS
ARE ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION

00:11:28.773 --> 00:11:30.873
TO CANCEL THE FINALS
FOR MEGALONIA.

00:11:30.873 --> 00:11:35.140

ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE CONTRACT.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.973
TO SIMPLY BEAT ON EACH OTHER?

00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:45.573

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.946
HEY! HOLD UP, BROTHER.

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:45.680

AND DON'T CALL ME BROTHER.

Joe: DON'T GOT ONE.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.180
NOW BUZZ OFF, POPS. I'M BUSY.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.046
Nanbu: HEY! DON'T BE LIKE THAT!

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:57.380
HANG ON A SEC!

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.720
I KNOW A BETTER WAY
TO MAKE SOME CASH!

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.553
Joe: HUH?

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:04.286
Nanbu: YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO WATCH OUT FOR YOU,

00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:05.420
SOMEONE LIKE ME.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920

STUMBLING COW.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.920
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.953
YOU GOTTA DISTRIBUTE
YOUR WEIGHT EVENLY!

00:13:31.953 --> 00:13:34.153
SLACK OFF JUST 'CAUSE
I CAN'T SEE YOU,

00:13:34.153 --> 00:13:35.553
AND I'LL BEAT YOUR ASS!

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.520
Joe: WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.420

Joe: WHAT DOES THIS COLUMN MEAN?

00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:06.093
Aragaki: HE MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT

00:14:06.093 --> 00:14:08.060

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.460

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.460
HE'S CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.926
MAYBE HE'S BEEN THE ONE
WATCHING OUT FOR ME.

00:14:13.926 --> 00:14:16.660

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:20.326

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.326
( groaning )

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.726
( screams )

00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:37.460

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:02.300
WHO IS THAT?

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.300
( gasping )

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:15.566

FOR FIVE DAYS.

( dog whimpering )

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:29.533
Yukiko: IS THERE NOTHING
YOU CAN DO FOR THE PAIN?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.966
NO DRUG? ANYTHING?

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.400
( Yuri screams )

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.166

( Mikio sighs )

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.300
A DOSE OF THIS
COULD EASE HIS SUFFERING.

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:48.733
BUT HE SAID,
"IF I CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN,

00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:51.733
THEN I DON'T DESERVE
TO FACE HIM IN THE RING."

00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:54.233
HE REFUSED
WHEN I BROUGHT IT UP.

00:15:54.233 --> 00:15:58.166
BUT YOU, YUKIKO,
HE MIGHT LISTEN TO YOU.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.006
( Yukiko gasps )

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.706

00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:16.240
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME NOW, YURI.

00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:19.173
( Yuri sighing )

00:16:19.173 --> 00:16:20.606
Yukiko: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU

00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:22.440
TO DO ANY FIGHTING
IN THIS CONDITION.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.340
WE'LL REATTACH YOUR GEAR,

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.673
AND YOU CAN STAND
PROUD AND TALL AGAIN.

00:16:27.673 --> 00:16:30.173

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.973

OF MY OLD DREAMS...

00:16:40.973 --> 00:16:42.006
Yukiko: EH?

00:16:42.006 --> 00:16:43.406

LONG BEFORE YOU AND I MET.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.073
THE MAN
WHO TAUGHT ME MEGALO‐BOXING

00:16:49.073 --> 00:16:52.006
TOLD ME SOMETHING
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

00:16:52.006 --> 00:16:53.773
"IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH

00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:56.973
"TO RUN INTO A FIGHTER
IN YOUR GENERATION

00:16:56.973 --> 00:17:00.946
"WHO YOU WANT TO WIN AGAINST
FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART,

00:17:00.946 --> 00:17:04.280
"CONSIDER YOURSELF BLESSED.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.613
"IF YOU EVER FIND
SOMEONE LIKE THAT,

NEVER LET HIM
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT."

00:17:09.613 --> 00:17:14.180
I'VE FINALLY MET THE OPPONENT
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:15.146 --> 00:17:18.646
YUKIKO, TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

00:17:18.646 --> 00:17:21.046
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GAVE ME A REASON TO LIVE.

Trainer: HE'S IN TOP FORM.

HIS RIGHT AND REMAIN STANDING.
