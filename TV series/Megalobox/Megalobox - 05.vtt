00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:30.473
TO PROVE YOURSELF.

00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:33.773
IF THAT'S THE GOAL,

00:11:33.773 --> 00:11:36.706
THEN YOU SHOULD CANCEL
THIS MATCH RIGHT NOW.

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:39.773
YOU MOVE UP BY FIGHTING
SOMEONE RANKED ABOVE YOU.

00:11:39.773 --> 00:11:42.573
YOU STILL HAVE TIME
TO WALK AWAY.

00:11:42.573 --> 00:11:44.406
Aragaki:
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:46.940
IF I FIGHT
THE FAMOUS "GEARLESS" JOE,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.473
IT'S SURE TO BRING IN
A LOT MORE SPONSORS

00:11:49.473 --> 00:11:51.606
AND, THEREFORE, MORE MONEY.

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:53.673
AND WITH THAT,
I'LL BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU

00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:55.640
AND EVERYONE ELSE
WHO'S HAD MY BACK.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.940
Trainer: THERE'S NO NEED.
NO ONE IS DOING THIS

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.480
BECAUSE THEY WERE
EXPECTING COMPENSATION.

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:04.480
NANBU CAME BY,
BUT I TURNED HIM AWAY.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.713
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:12:06.713 --> 00:12:09.646
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
OF HIS NEW STUDENT.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.113
YOU'RE UPSET
THE KID'S IN THE PLACE

00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:13.613
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOURS.

00:12:13.613 --> 00:12:16.646
YOU NEED TO LEAVE
THE PAST IN THE PAST.

00:12:16.646 --> 00:12:18.846
DOESN'T THIS
SEEM PETTY TO YOU?

00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:23.113
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A DOG
THAT WAS ABANDONED BY ITS OWNER.

00:12:23.113 --> 00:12:26.413
Aragaki: I APPRECIATE
ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR ME, REALLY,

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.780
BUT EVERY MAN
SEES THINGS HIS OWN WAY.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.713
THIS BOILS DOWN TO HOW
YOU AND I ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

00:12:35.346 --> 00:12:37.513
( grunting )

00:12:37.513 --> 00:12:39.746

JUST LIKE HIM.

Nanbu: LISTEN.
THIS IS YOUR HOME.

00:13:45.853 --> 00:13:46.986
REMEMBER THAT.

Joe: HEY.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.960
Sachio: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL DAY, POPS?!

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.060
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.093
Nanbu: HMM?

00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:41.626
Sachio: ARAGAKI'S GEAR LOOKS

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:43.460
LIKE IT'S DESIGNED
TO BE LIGHTWEIGHT.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.926
IF THAT'S TRUE, I DON'T THINK

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.560
HE'D HAVE MUCH
OF A POWER ADVANTAGE OVER JOE.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.326
Nanbu: EVEN IF THE ADVANTAGE
IS SMALL, WITHOUT GEAR,

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:53.360
JOE'S GONNA HAVE
LESS POWER THAN ARAGAKI.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.460
Sachio: ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT IF THEY'RE SO SET

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.826
ON MAKING SURE
HIS GEAR IS LIGHT,

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:58.393
MAYBE IT MEANS THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT HIS STAMINA.

00:14:58.393 --> 00:15:01.833
I MEAN, HE IS OVER 30, YOU KNOW.

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.500
Nanbu: THE REASON
HE WANTS LIGHTER GEAR

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.433
IS SO IT WON'T SLOW HIM DOWN.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.100
THE SPEED HE MOVES AROUND WITH,
HIS FOOTWORK,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.733
ANY DISADVANTAGE THOSE LEGS
WOULD GIVE HIM IN A FIGHT,

00:15:12.733 --> 00:15:15.566
HE'S DONE ALL THE TRAINING
HE CAN TO OVERCOME IT,

00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:18.066
EVEN MORE THAN HE DID
WHEN I WAS COACHIN' HIM.

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:20.500
Sachio: HE'S ONE STEP
AHEAD OF US ON EVERYTHING.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.866
YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING TO WONDER
WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE EVEN ON, POPS.

00:15:23.866 --> 00:15:25.566
( Nanbu sighs )

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:27.000
Sachio: I MEAN,
ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.866
HAS BEEN NEAR THE TOP
OF THE RANKINGS FOR A WHILE NOW.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.800
HOW COME YOU
DIDN'T NOTICE HIM SOONER?

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.066
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, HUH?

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.800

Nanbu: WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,
YOU LITTLE BRAT?

00:15:40.966 --> 00:15:44.300
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD
UNTIL THE OTHER DAY.

00:15:47.266 --> 00:15:49.633
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT ME?

00:15:49.633 --> 00:15:52.400
I MEAN,
I'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIM,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.966
NOT LIKE HE'D
DROPPED OFF THE MAP,

00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:57.300
BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE
HE'D NEVER BEEN BORN.

00:15:58.433 --> 00:16:00.740
IT'S NO WONDER HE HATES ME.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.640
I BLOCKED OUT
HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.140
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS
CONVENIENT FOR ME.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.306
I'M A DAMN TRAITOR.

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:09.906
Boy: HEY! ( chuckles )

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:12.673
Aragaki: THE NANBU I KNEW
WOULD HAVE NEVER TRIED

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:15.840
SOMETHING AS GIMMICKY
AS FIGHTING WITHOUT GEAR.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.373
I'VE LOST ALL RESPECT FOR HIM.

00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:21.973
MAYBE THAT OFFENDS YOU,
BUT THERE IT IS.

00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:23.673
Joe: NAH, I AGREE WITH YOU,

00:16:23.673 --> 00:16:26.640
BUT I DON'T EXACTLY HATE
THE OLD MAN'S BLUFFS.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.440
Aragaki: YOU MUST PUT
A LOT OF TRUST IN HIM.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.206
Joe: THE WAY I SEE IT,
HE BELIEVED IN ME,

00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:36.240
SO I'LL BELIEVE IN HIM.
SIMPLE ENOUGH, RIGHT?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.673
( Aragaki scoffs )
IT'S HIS NATURE

00:16:37.673 --> 00:16:40.673
TO BETRAY SUCH TRUST
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

00:16:40.673 --> 00:16:43.373
I JUST HOPE THAT BETRAYAL
DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOU, TOO.

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:46.506
Joe: YOU SAYING
IT'S POPS'S FAULT

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.973
YOUR LEGS ENDED UP LIKE THAT?

00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:50.306
( Aragaki sighs )

00:16:50.306 --> 00:16:52.240
( boys grunting )

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.740
Boy: GOIN' IN FOR THE KILL.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.206
Joe: HE'S NOT LEADING ME AROUND
BY THE HAND OR ANYTHING.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:59.780
HE'S GOT HIS LIFE,
AND I'VE GOT MINE.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.313
BLAME WHOEVER YOU WANT,

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:03.946
BUT IN THE END,
A MAN MAKES HIS OWN CALLS.

00:17:03.946 --> 00:17:06.346
Aragaki: GUESS THE TWO OF US
DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE.

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:08.913
Joe: YOU WANNA
DESTROY ME, RIGHT?

00:17:08.913 --> 00:17:10.213
GO ON AND TRY.

00:17:13.513 --> 00:17:16.446
JUST DON'T EXPECT IT
TO BE EASY.

00:17:21.046 --> 00:17:23.680
Nanbu: YOU'RE PUTTIN' TOO MUCH
WEIGHT ON YOUR FRONT FOOT AGAIN.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.613
YOU GOTTA SPLIT IT EVENLY.

00:17:25.613 --> 00:17:28.446
NEVER FORGET
TO KEEP THAT BALANCE.

00:17:28.446 --> 00:17:29.880
‐ ( punches whoosh )
‐ SEE? THIS IS WHAT I MEAN.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.646
IF HE DODGES ONE OF THOSE,
YOU'LL BE TOO SLOW TO FOLLOW UP.

00:17:32.646 --> 00:17:35.146
ARAGAKI'S FAST
WHEN IT COMES TO SWITCHING

00:17:35.146 --> 00:17:36.646
BETWEEN ATTACK AND DEFENSE.

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:39.080
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP,
HE'LL BE ALL OVER YOU.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.213
( Joe sighs )

00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:42.080
Nanbu: HUH? HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.746
YOU'RE NOT FINISHED HERE YET.

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:47.713
Joe: TELL ME. YOU STILL
DON'T THINK I CAN WIN, RIGHT?

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:49.046
( Nanbu sighs )

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:52.813
Joe: THE POPS THAT I KNOW,
EVEN IF IT WAS A FLAT‐OUT LIE,

00:17:52.813 --> 00:17:55.546
WOULD AT LEAST TELL ME
I COULD PULL IT OFF.

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:59.280
MAN, YOU HAVE CHANGED.
YOU NEVER GAVE A DAMN ABOUT ME

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.186
BACK WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING
MATCHES IN THE UNDERGROUND.

00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:05.720
Nanbu: NEWS FLASH, KID.
I STILL DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.186
Joe: IS THAT SO?

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.086
THEN I'LL JUST WIN MY OWN WAY.

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:12.220

SEEMS LIKE POPS'S PLAN
REALLY PAID OFF.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.626
WAIT. WHERE IS HE?

00:19:14.626 --> 00:19:15.860
Joe: I DON'T KNOW.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.793
Sachio: I DON'T GET IT.

00:19:17.793 --> 00:19:19.560

GIVE UP, DID HE?

LIKE YOU THOUGHT, OKAY?

00:19:39.393 --> 00:19:41.326
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.
I RAN AWAY.

WE HAD BACK THEN.
