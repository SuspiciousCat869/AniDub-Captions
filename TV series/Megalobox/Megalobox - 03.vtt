OOH! ( grunts )

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:20.760
Man: THAT RIGHT THERE...

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.160
IS THE COMPOSITE
TITANIUM PROTOTYPE

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.326
SHIRATO COOKED UP BEFORE
THEIR CURRENT INTEGRATED MODEL,

00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:28.093
TOP‐SHELF STUFF.

00:09:28.093 --> 00:09:30.460
FOR SPEED, IT'D EVEN KEEP UP
WITH THE LATEST MODEL.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.360
Nanbu: IF WE HAD THIS BAD BOY...

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.560
( man grunts )

00:09:35.693 --> 00:09:38.560
BUT MINE'S GOT
MORE FACE‐POUNDING POWER.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.460
Nanbu: YOUR GEAR
LOOKS PRETTY BADASS.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.893
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,

00:09:41.893 --> 00:09:43.460
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE FIGHTING IN THE RING

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.693
WITH GLOVES LIKE THOSE.

00:09:44.693 --> 00:09:46.393
Goskino:
THAT'S POTEMKIN HIGASHI,

00:09:46.393 --> 00:09:47.560
A FORMER MEGALO‐BOXER.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.893
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM

00:09:48.893 --> 00:09:50.693
TO TAKE YOU OUTSIDE
AND ROUGH YOU UP,

00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:52.526
YOU'LL TAKE YOUR PAWS
OFF THE MERCHANDISE.

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:53.726
Nanbu: OH! ( laughs ) SORRY!

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.926
Goskino: YOU GUYS CAN'T AFFORD

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:56.426
HIGH‐TECH GEAR
LIKE THIS, ANYWAY. HUH?

00:09:56.426 --> 00:09:58.126
‐ Boy: SLOW DOWN, SANTA!
‐ Goskino: HUH?

00:09:58.126 --> 00:09:58.960
Boy: I'M DYING HERE!

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.233
Santa: DON'T SAY
MY NAME, DUMBASS.

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.733
Bonjiri: OH. I'M SORRY.

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:04.400
Oicho: I CALL DIBS
ON THE MIDDLE!

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.433
Bonjiri: MAN, I'M BEAT.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.800
Sachio: YOU GOT THE STUFF?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.300
Oicho: HERE IT COMES!
HERE IT COMES!

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.766
Goskino: DAMN.

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.900
POTEMKIN,
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM, OKAY?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.500
BUNCH OF GREEDY‐ASS,
GOOD‐FOR‐NOTHING KIDS.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.800
‐ ( grumbles )
‐ ( Sachio gasps )

00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:25.666
Joe: YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUY
THAT ONE, POPS?

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:27.733
‐ ( Nanbu groans )
‐ Joe: WHY WOULDN'T YOU?

00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:30.833
IT'D GIVE US AN EDGE
IN MEGALONIA, WOULDN'T IT?

00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:33.000
( Potemkin scoffs )
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.633
I USED TO RANK 96th.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.433
AND YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT GETTING INTO MEGALONIA?

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:37.800
Joe: YOU HEARD OF HIM?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.800
‐ Nanbu: NOPE.
‐ ( Potemkin growls )

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.133
Goskino: HEY!
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:42.533
TO WATCH THOSE STREET RATS.

00:10:42.533 --> 00:10:44.666
Potemkin: HUH? YEAH, YEAH.
GET OFF MY BACK.

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.766
Goskino: HERE YOU GO,
FOR THE CAMERAS.

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:49.366
Oicho: RED CANDY!

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:51.233
( Bonjiri gasps )

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:52.400
Nanbu: HEY, THAT'S BAD STUFF.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.966
IT'LL ROT YOUR BRAINS OUT, BOYS.

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:56.066
Goskino: EASY.
THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF KIDS.

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:57.966
THEY'LL LIVE HAND TO MOUTH
HOWEVER THEY CAN.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:00.033
BUT WHEN THEY GET AHOLD
OF SOME OF THAT RED CANDY,

00:11:00.033 --> 00:11:02.440
IT LETS THEM ESCAPE
THE HARSHNESS OF THEIR LIVES,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.040
EVEN IF ONLY FOR A BIT.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.673
Joe: NICE WORDS FROM THE GUY
WHO'S PUTTING THEM UP

00:11:06.673 --> 00:11:08.573
‐ TO STEALING FOR IT.
‐ ( Sachio growls )

00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:10.740
‐ Nanbu: JOE.
‐ Sachio: WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?!

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.206
THERE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE FOUR OF 'EM!

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:14.806
Goskino: YOU'RE LUCKY I GAVE YOU
THREE FOR THOSE JUNKY CAMERAS!

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:17.706
NOW KEEP YOUR ASS‐BREATH
OUT OF MY FACE! GOT IT?!

00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:19.306
Sachio: GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF ME!

00:11:19.306 --> 00:11:21.206
Goskino: OW!

00:11:21.206 --> 00:11:22.440
( groans )

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.206
BASTARD! YOU'RE DEAD!

00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:25.406
( Nanbu gasps )

00:11:25.406 --> 00:11:27.173
‐ EASY!
‐ Goskino: HUH?

00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:28.340
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS, TOO?!

00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:31.506
( Sachio gasps )

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.006
Joe: JUST GIVE IT A REST, MAN.

00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:37.306
Goskino: POTEMKIN!

00:11:37.306 --> 00:11:38.440
Potemkin: OH! RIGHT.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.306
Joe: LOOK, CALM DOWN, PAL.

00:11:40.306 --> 00:11:42.273
MY BAD. I GIVE UP.

00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:43.340
( Nanbu groans )
DAMN IT ALL.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.673
Potemkin: HUH?

00:11:44.673 --> 00:11:46.173
Goskino: TAKE YOUR THUMB
OUT OF YOUR ASS!

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:48.773
‐ Potemkin: B‐BUT I WAS JUST‐‐
‐ ( truck door closes )

00:11:48.773 --> 00:11:50.273
Nanbu: THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOUR NOSE

00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:52.740
WHEN YOU STICK IT IN OTHER
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS, JACKASS.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.973
Joe: WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO, THEN?

00:11:54.973 --> 00:11:58.573
Nanbu: IGNORE IT.
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

00:11:58.573 --> 00:12:00.846
Joe: COME ON.
HE WAS JUST A LITTLE KID,

00:12:02.613 --> 00:12:06.446
( sighs )
AN UGLY ONE, AT THAT.

00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:16.846
( water lapping )

00:12:21.846 --> 00:12:23.613
( Sachio gasps )

00:12:24.546 --> 00:12:26.680
WHAT'S WITH THE JUNKYARD GYM?

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:31.413
Nanbu: THIS IS
THE 185th‐RANKED MEGALO‐BOXER,

00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:33.946
SHARK SAMEJIMA,
KNOWN AS "MANEATER."

00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:37.513
HE'S GOT HIS SHARE OF LOSSES,
BUT ABOUT 70% OF THOSE

00:12:37.513 --> 00:12:40.013
ARE DISQUALIFICATIONS
FOR FIGHTING DIRTY.

00:12:40.013 --> 00:12:43.546
WORD ON THE STREET IS HE'S HAD
TROUBLE LINING UP OPPONENTS.

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:46.413
Joe: A MAN‐EATING SHARK, HUH?

00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:50.880
Nanbu: IF THE GUY AT THE BOTTOM
WANTS TO MAKE HIS WAY UP FAST,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.946
HE'S GOTTA DRAW ATTENTION
TO HIMSELF.

00:12:52.946 --> 00:12:57.746
AND THIS GUY,
HE'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

00:12:57.746 --> 00:13:01.286
Joe: SO I GUESS
THAT MAKES ME FISH BAIT NOW?

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:02.353
( Gear whirs )

00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:04.153
Nanbu: THE FIGHT'S IN FIVE DAYS.

00:13:04.153 --> 00:13:05.620
LET'S GET STARTED.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.786
Joe: DON'T I NEED MY GEAR?

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:10.953
Nanbu: THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA TEACH YOU FIRST.

00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:12.153
Joe: SERIOUSLY?

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:14.820
( scoffs ) GET REAL.
WHAT HAVEN'T YOU TAUGHT‐‐

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.620
OW!

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.686
Nanbu: REMEMBER
THAT LITTLE SCRAP YESTERDAY?

00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:22.986
‐ Bonjiri: I'M SO HUNGRY.
‐ Nanbu: YOU GET SO FOCUSED
ON TRYING TO INTERCEPT

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.253
‐ THAT YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.
‐ Sachio: JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?

00:13:25.253 --> 00:13:27.186
THAT'S A BAD HABIT YOU GOT.

00:13:27.186 --> 00:13:28.086
Joe: YOU PIECE OF‐‐

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:29.286
Nanbu: COME ON.

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:31.853
YOU DID IT AGAIN.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:35.286
YOU GOTTA STOP TRYING TO PARRY
WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO.

00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:37.120
FOCUS ON KEEPING THAT GUARD UP.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.120
YOUR GEAR'S BEING UPGRADED,
SO THAT SHOULD HELP.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.486
( Joe sighs )

00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:44.253
Nanbu: BUT NO MATTER
HOW GOOD THE GEAR IS

00:13:44.253 --> 00:13:45.886
OR HOW CUTTING‐EDGE IT MAY BE,

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:48.053
IT'S NOT WHAT MAKES
OR BREAKS A FIGHT.

00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:51.720
IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO THE GUY
WEARING IT. REMEMBER THAT.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.753
( Joe sighs ) LET'S KEEP AT IT.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.386
Sachio: MEGALONIA, MY ASS.

00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:01.160
Bonjiri: I'M SO HUNGRY.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.560
Santa: SACHIO, LET'S GET GOING.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.593
Sachio: HE'S RANKED DEAD LAST.

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:06.660
Nanbu: SEE?
YOU DROPPED YOUR GUARD AGAIN.

00:14:08.293 --> 00:14:10.260
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY WORK

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.626
ON THAT DEFENSE OF YOURS.

00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:13.893
YOU GONNA SWAY AND FADE
OR WEAVE AROUND THE PUNCHES?

00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:16.326
YOU'D BETTER THINK
HARD AND FAST OUT THERE,

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:18.326
OR YOU COULD END UP A DEAD MAN.

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:20.193
Oicho: HA! GOT YOU! ( laughs )

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:23.160
Santa: NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET IT!
TAKE THAT!

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.793
Nanbu:
HANGIN' AROUND HERE AGAIN?

00:14:24.793 --> 00:14:26.293
‐ ( boys laughing )
‐ Nanbu: DAMN IT ALL.

00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:27.160
KIDS! YOU'RE DISTRACTING US!

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.526
GO PLAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!

00:14:28.526 --> 00:14:30.293
Santa: IT'S NOT
YOUR PROPERTY, GEEZER!

00:14:30.293 --> 00:14:31.526
Oicho: THE RIVER'S FREE FOR ALL!

00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:33.160
Bonjiri: VIVA FREEDOM!

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.593
Nanbu: I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH OF YOU LITTLE RUNTS!

00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:36.760
Sachio: YOU GOT
SOME KINDA PROBLEM, MISTER?

00:14:38.326 --> 00:14:40.760
( Joe chuckles ) NOT ME, KID.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.360
LET'S KEEP AT IT, POPS.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.760
Nanbu: ALL RIGHT.

00:14:46.126 --> 00:14:48.560
( blows thumping )

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.833
HOW'S THE NEW GEAR FEEL?

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:04.700
LET ME GET MY GUARD UP.
THEN TAKE A FEW SHOTS AT ME.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.133
OOH! ( groaning )

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:08.200
A GUT PUNCH?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.666
Joe: NOT BAD AT ALL.

00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:11.400
GOTTA SAY,
I'M IMPRESSED, POPS.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.966
Nanbu: WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

00:15:12.966 --> 00:15:14.933
IF YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF
A FIRST‐RATE TRAINER,

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:16.966
YOU BETTER HAVE A KNACK
FOR TINKERING, TOO.

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:18.366
( Joe chuckles )

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:20.200
Nanbu: IT OUGHT TO BE
TWICE AS POWERFUL AS BEFORE,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.466
HELL, THREE TIMES, MAYBE.

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:22.600
THIS BAD BOY
SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO‐‐

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.766
‐ Sachio: WRONG!
‐ Nanbu: HUH?

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:27.300
Sachio: HE AIN'T NEVER
GONNA WIN WITH THAT GEAR.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.766
YEAH, IT'S GOT MORE POWER,

00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:31.366
BUT THE ADDED WEIGHT
IS GONNA PUT STRAIN ON HIS ARMS.

00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:32.933
HE WON'T LAST A SINGLE ROUND

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:35.433
IF HE CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE OTHER GUY'S SPEED.

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.366
DID YOU FORGET
ABOUT THE BATTERY?

00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:39.033
IF YOU TRY
AND PUSH IT ANY HARDER,

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:40.100
YOU'LL BURN IT OUT.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.433
Nanbu: WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:43.600
YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF FOR A KID.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.600
BUT IF HE FIGHTS
LIKE I TELL HIM TO,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.533
THEN ONE ROUND
IS ALL WE'RE GONNA NEED.

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:50.466
Sachio: HE'LL END UP DEAD
IF HE TRIES TO‐‐

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:52.533
Nanbu: YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA,
SMART GUY?

00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:54.700
THIS IS THE ONLY REAL OPTION
WE'VE GOT.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.233
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, BOY.
I'VE GOT TRAINING TO DO.
