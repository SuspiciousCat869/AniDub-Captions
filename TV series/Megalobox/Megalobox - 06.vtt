THIS POWERFUL
HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHTER

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.140
HAS MANAGED TO DISTINGUISH
HIMSELF IN MEGALO‐BOXING,

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.640
WHERE MIDDLEWEIGHT FIGHTERS
TYPICALLY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.773
Announcer: LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR GLEN BURROUGHS!

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:10.606
( applause )

00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:14.006
Reporter: THERE'S LESS THAN
A MONTH UNTIL MEGALONIA BEGINS.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.973
WHEN WILL THE LAST FIGHTER
BE ANNOUNCED,

00:21:15.973 --> 00:21:17.740
AND WHAT WILL THE CRITERIA BE?

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.806
Yukiko:
AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW,

00:21:19.806 --> 00:21:22.206
WE'LL PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE
THAT COMPETITOR.

00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:23.206
Reporter #2:
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

00:21:23.206 --> 00:21:25.006
OF "GEARLESS" JOE ENTERING?

00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:26.806
HE RECENTLY DEFEATED ARAGAKI,

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:28.773
A FAVORITE
TO CLAIM THE LAST SLOT.

00:21:28.773 --> 00:21:30.506
Yukiko: WELL...

00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:33.473
AS I'VE SAID BEFORE,
MEGALONIA IS OPEN TO ALL.

00:21:33.473 --> 00:21:36.840
I ASSURE YOU, ONCE THE LAST
FIGHTER HAS BEEN SELECTED,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.340
YOU WILL ALL BE INFORMED.

00:21:40.773 --> 00:21:42.740
Mikio: YOU LOOK BORED
OUT HERE, YURI.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.873
Yuri: MIKIO.

00:21:45.873 --> 00:21:47.973
Mikio: TOUGH LUCK
FOR MR. BURROUGHS.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.773
INSTEAD OF GETTING
HIS MOMENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT,

00:21:50.773 --> 00:21:53.273
THE MEDIA FOCUSED
ON SOMEONE ELSE.

00:21:53.273 --> 00:21:54.206
Yuri: HMM?

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.413
HE'S DOING IT.

00:22:08.413 --> 00:22:10.580
Mikio: YUKIKO TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.346
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS,

00:22:14.346 --> 00:22:17.780
THE MYSTERY FIGHTER
WHO MEGALOBOXES

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.746
WITHOUT ANY ENHANCEMENTS,
"GEARLESS" JOE.

00:22:21.746 --> 00:22:24.146
HE'S QUITE POPULAR.

00:22:24.146 --> 00:22:25.746
Yuri: JOE.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:30.413
Mikio: BUT THAT WILL SOON
COME TO AN END.

00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:35.180
MEGALONIA IS NO PLACE
FOR STRAY DOGS LIKE HIM.
