WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
TO ATTACH WEAPONS

00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:29.566
DIRECTLY TO YOUR
INTEGRATED GEAR?

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:31.166
WOULD THE TECH COOPERATE?

00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:34.766
I WON'T DENY THAT WHAT
YOU'RE PROPOSING IS REMARKABLE,

00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:37.266
BUT WE HAVE COST PERFORMANCE
TO CONSIDER

WHEN MAKING SUCH A DECISION.

00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:42.466
Yukiko: GEAR ITSELF
ISN'T A WEAPON.

00:10:42.466 --> 00:10:44.000
FUNDAMENTALLY SPEAKING,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000

ITS USER'S PERFORMANCE.

Officer #2: YET DURING THIS
PROCESS, YOU'VE BEEN SHOWING US

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:51.500
JUST WHAT AN EFFECTIVE
COMBAT WEAPON IT COULD BE,

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.266
YOU AND SHIRATO'S CHAMPION.

MEANT TO BE A DEATH SPORT.

Officer #2:
IS THAT WHY YOU HAD HIM

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.940
REMOVE HIS GEAR
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.673

NECESSARY FOR HIM TO HAVE IT.

CONSIDERS GEAR

00:11:08.473 --> 00:11:10.873
TO BE A SUPPLEMENT
TO THE HUMAN BODY.

00:11:10.873 --> 00:11:13.740
THE DATA GAINED FROM TESTING IT
THROUGH MEGALO‐BOXING

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.706
WAS ONLY A FIRST STEP
IN ITS DEVELOPMENT.

Officer #2:
AND MILITARY APPLICATION

00:11:18.573 --> 00:11:20.973
IS THE NEXT PHASE
OF DEVELOPMENT? IS THAT IT?

00:11:20.973 --> 00:11:24.840
Yukiko: WE MAY HAVE CERTAIN
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.673
BUT I BELIEVE A PARTNERSHIP
WOULD BENEFIT US BOTH.

THE CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE

00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:44.466
HAS BEEN VACANT IN THE YEAR
SINCE THE FINALS,

00:20:44.466 --> 00:20:46.133
‐ BUT WITH THE NEWS OF THIS...
‐ ( Abuhachi chuckles )

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:49.833
SO YOU'RE FINALLY ABLE
TO KEEP HER RUNNING ON YOUR OWN?

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.200
Joe: MORE OR LESS.

00:20:55.566 --> 00:20:57.600
SORRY FOR THE RUSH JOB.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.540
Abuhachi: HELL, I DON'T MIND.
THINK OF IT AS A GIFT.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.373
( Joe laughs )
THEY'RE GONNA BE REAL HAPPY.

00:21:03.373 --> 00:21:05.106
THEY WON'T SHUT UP
ABOUT GETTING IN THE RING

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:07.006
AS SOON AS THEY CAN.

00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:08.106
Abuhachi: HMM.

00:21:08.106 --> 00:21:10.006
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:11.840
ARE YOU DONE WITH THE RING?

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.206
( Joe sighs )

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:16.673
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME?

00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:19.473
ABOUT BELIEVING IN THE PART
OF YOU THAT BELIEVES

00:21:19.473 --> 00:21:22.073
AND HOW LIVING LIKE THAT
WASN'T SO BAD?

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:25.673
Abuhachi: YEAH. BUT I
ALSO REMEMBER SAYING,

00:21:25.673 --> 00:21:29.706
"REAL BOXERS ARE PROBABLY
GUYS JUST LIKE YOU,"

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:31.640
AND I WAS RIGHT.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.840
( Joe chuckles )

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.673
WE WON AS A TEAM.

00:21:35.673 --> 00:21:38.973
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUTURE'S GONNA BE LIKE,

00:21:38.973 --> 00:21:42.873
BUT FOR NOW, I JUST
THOUGHT I'D PASS THAT ON.

00:21:42.873 --> 00:21:44.840
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.740
Abuhachi: TAKE CARE.

00:21:49.606 --> 00:21:53.073
