00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:53.826
I'M BETTING MY LIFE
ON WHAT MY FISTS CAN DO.

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:56.293
IT'S SCARY AS HELL, NO DOUBT,

00:19:56.293 --> 00:19:58.593
BUT IT'S SO FUN,
I CAN BARELY STAND IT.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.866
I WANNA FIGHT YOU
IN A REAL MATCH,

00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:06.800
PURE AND SIMPLE.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.100
I THINK, AGAINST YOU,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.833
I'D GO FURTHER
THAN I'VE EVER GONE BEFORE.

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:11.866
Yuri: EH...

00:20:11.866 --> 00:20:13.566
Joe: AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:15.466
WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR?

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:19.633
Yuri: A DREAM.

00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:20.633
Joe: HUH?

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.866
Yuri: THERE WAS SOMEONE
WHO BELIEVED IN ME.

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:24.900
SHE HAD FAITH IN ME
WHEN I WAS NOTHING

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.966
AND BROUGHT ME THIS FAR.

00:20:26.966 --> 00:20:28.666
HER DREAM IS WHY.

00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:30.100
( Joe sighs )

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.233
( Nanbu groaning )

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.866
SWEET DREAMS, HUH?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:42.833
( chuckles )

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.000
Fujimaki: HAVE YOU DISCUSSED
THINGS WITH YOUR PARTNER?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.166
( Nanbu laughs )
YOU BET I HAVE.

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:52.233
AND THE THOUGHT OF FINALLY BEING
OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THIS DEBT

00:20:52.233 --> 00:20:55.200
REQUIRES A CELEBRATORY DRINK.
YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.233
Fujimaki: YOU TRULY
ARE A SCORPION.

00:20:57.233 --> 00:20:59.240
HERE. LET'S DRINK TO THAT.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.206
Nanbu: HUH?

00:21:01.773 --> 00:21:04.140
Fujimaki:
NEVER HEARD THAT STORY?

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.106
THERE'S THIS SCORPION, SEE,

00:21:06.106 --> 00:21:09.373
AND THERE'S THIS RIVER
HE WANTS TO CROSS.

00:21:09.373 --> 00:21:12.773
PROBLEM IS,
SCORPIONS CAN'T SWIM,

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:16.206
SO THE SCORPION ASKS A FROG
THAT HAPPENS TO BE BY THE RIVER

00:21:16.206 --> 00:21:18.073
IF HE'D GIVE HIM A RIDE
ON HIS BACK

00:21:18.073 --> 00:21:20.273
SO HE CAN GET ACROSS SAFELY.

00:21:20.273 --> 00:21:22.840
THE FROG SAYS TO THE SCORPION,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.573
"I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'LL STING ME, WON'T YOU?"

00:21:25.573 --> 00:21:29.206
THE SCORPION RESPONDS,
"I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:31.106
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:34.640
IF YOU WERE TO DIE
HALFWAY ACROSS, I'D DROWN."

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.906
THE FROG PONDERS THIS
FOR A MOMENT AND IS CONVINCED,

00:21:37.906 --> 00:21:40.106
SO HE KINDLY LETS THE SCORPION
ONTO HIS BACK

00:21:40.106 --> 00:21:41.773
AND STARTS TO CROSS THE RIVER.

00:21:41.773 --> 00:21:47.440
BUT WHILE THEY'RE IN THE WATER,
THE SCORPION STINGS THE FROG.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.840
AS HE'S LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS,
THE FROG SAYS,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.673
"YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULDN'T
STING ME. NOW WE'LL BOTH DIE."

00:21:53.673 --> 00:21:55.906
AND AS THEY SANK
BENEATH THE WATER,

00:21:55.906 --> 00:21:57.606
THE SCORPION TELLS HIM...

00:21:57.606 --> 00:21:59.780
Nanbu: "I JUST COULDN'T HELP IT.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.046
IT'S SIMPLY THE NATURE
OF A SCORPION TO STING."
