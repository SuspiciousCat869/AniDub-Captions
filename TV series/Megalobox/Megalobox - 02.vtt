THE OTHER GUY
LANDS A LUCKY PUNCH,

00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:55.746
YOU GO DOWN. PIECE OF CAKE.

00:12:56.946 --> 00:12:59.753
Junk Dog: LISTEN, POPS.
I NEED A FAVOR.

00:12:59.753 --> 00:13:01.586
Nanbu: HUH?

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:04.420
SURE. WHATEVER YOU NEED.
( laughs )

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.553
THAT SCRAP YOU WERE IN WITH YURI
GAVE THINGS A BOOST.

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:09.820
IT DOUBLED THE AUDIENCE,
ALONG WITH OUR CUT.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.820
IF THINGS KEEP GOIN'
THE WAY THEY'RE HEADED NOW,

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.953
I'LL BE OUT OF DEBT
IN NO TIME AT‐‐HMM? WHAT'S THIS?

00:13:15.953 --> 00:13:20.153
Junk Dog: I GOTTA HAVE
ANOTHER SHOT AT FIGHTING YURI.

00:13:20.153 --> 00:13:21.653
GET ME INTO MEGALONIA.

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.920
( Nanbu growls )

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.520
YOU SERIOUS?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.320
Junk Dog: YEAH. DEAD SERIOUS.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.453
PLEASE GET ME IN HIS RING.

00:13:31.453 --> 00:13:33.253
( Nanbu chuckles )

00:13:33.253 --> 00:13:35.320
HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?!

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.986
DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:40.120
HE COULD HAVE TURNED YOU
INTO BLOOD SAUSAGE LAST TIME.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.086
NOW YOU WANNA TALK
LIKE A BIG SHOT

00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:43.320
AND STEP INTO "HIS RING."

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.686
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:46.786
YOU THINK A FRAUD
CAN BECOME THE REAL DEAL.

00:13:46.786 --> 00:13:49.653
Junk Dog: YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO'D BE FIGHTING HIM, POPS.

00:13:49.653 --> 00:13:50.453
I AM.

00:13:51.453 --> 00:13:52.920
( Nanbu groans )

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.786
AW, COME ON.
SNAP OUT OF IT, PARTNER.

00:13:55.786 --> 00:13:58.820
DID YOU FORGET
THAT YOU NEED A CITIZEN I. D.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.260
TO EVEN ENTER
A SANCTIONED MATCH?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS?

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.993
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DO.

00:14:04.993 --> 00:14:07.426
AND EVEN IF YOU DID
HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE,

00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:11.526
ONLY THE TOP FOUR RANKED
FIGHTERS GET INTO THE BRACKET.

00:14:11.526 --> 00:14:13.826
YOU COULD BUST YOUR ASS
LIKE NEVER BEFORE,

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:16.160
AND YOU'D STILL NEVER GET
THAT FAR IN THREE MONTHS.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.493
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.

00:14:18.493 --> 00:14:20.760
LISTEN. GUYS LIKE US,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.826
WE DON'T GET TO THINK
ABOUT TOMORROW.

00:14:23.826 --> 00:14:25.560
YOU FOCUS TOO MUCH
ON THAT STUFF,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.760
AND YOU END UP A DEAD MAN.

00:14:30.993 --> 00:14:32.626
( laughs )

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:35.760
ENOUGH WITH ALL THIS
HEAD‐IN‐THE‐CLOUDS CRAP.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.026
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS FOCUS ON THE JOB

00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:40.826
THAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY. GOT IT?

00:14:40.826 --> 00:14:41.760
( chuckles )

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.593
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:46.293
THINK I'M GONNA GO
CHECK THE CROWD NUMBERS.

00:14:46.293 --> 00:14:48.393
GO AHEAD,
AND START GETTING READY.

00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:51.193
( humming a tune )

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:54.926
( crowd murmuring )

00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:02.366
Referee: THE FIRST MATCH
OF THE DAY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:04.100
Nanbu: TAKE A LOOK.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.166
DAMN, WHAT A BUNCH OF MARKS.

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:07.733
READY, PARTNER?

00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:10.100
GO A LITTLE EASY
ON THE GUY, OKAY?

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.133
IF YOU GO IN GUNS A‐BLAZIN',

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:14.600
HE WON'T LAST UNTIL ROUND FIVE.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.500
HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME IN THERE, KID?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.800
( gasps )

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.333
‐ WHERE'S THE EARPIECE?
‐ ( bell rings )

00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:22.766
( crowd cheering )

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.033
( Rainy chuckles )

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:28.133
HOLD ON. WHAT ARE YOU...

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:32.400
( all gasping )

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.333
Referee: UH, START COUNTING.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.400
Computer: ONE...

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.966
TWO...

00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:39.500
( Nanbu growls )

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.000
‐ UNGRATEFUL BASTARD!
‐ Computer: THREE...

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.366
FOUR...

00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:43.933
Nanbu: WILL YOU BUZZ OFF?!

00:15:43.933 --> 00:15:46.500
‐ I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF‐‐
‐ Computer: FIVE...

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.133
SIX...

00:15:48.966 --> 00:15:51.600
( Nanbu gasps )

00:15:56.733 --> 00:15:58.600
( thumping, whooshing )

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.406
( bubbling )

00:16:05.406 --> 00:16:07.506
( thumping, whooshing continue )

00:16:07.506 --> 00:16:10.340
( man screams )

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.940
( Nanbu shuddering )

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.306
( man groans )

00:16:16.206 --> 00:16:18.473
( man groans )

00:16:18.473 --> 00:16:22.840
Nanbu: MR. FUJIMAKI,
I'M SO SORRY!

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.140
THE KID AND I
HAVE HELPED EACH OTHER OUT

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.140
AND GOTTEN ALONG GREAT
UP UNTIL NOW.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.106
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:31.140
I NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D BETRAY ME LIKE THIS!

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.906
I FEEL SO DAMN PATHETIC
AND DEFEATED AND‐‐

00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:37.940
( sobbing )

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.940
Fujimaki:
THIS IS FOND DE GIBIER.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.873
EVER HEARD OF IT?

00:16:40.873 --> 00:16:42.940
Nanbu: UH, SIR?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.540
Fujimaki: IT'S FRENCH.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.173
YOU HUNT WILD GAME AND THEN
MAKE SOUP STOCK OUT OF IT.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.573
Nanbu: OH.

00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:52.373
Fujimaki: IF YOU REALLY
TAKE YOUR TIME BOILING IT,

00:16:52.373 --> 00:16:57.140
YOU CAN GET 500 GRAMS OF FOND
OUT OF 500 GRAMS OF BONE.

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:00.580
WORKS OUT PRETTY NICELY,
DOESN'T IT?

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.913
( Nanbu stammering )

00:17:01.913 --> 00:17:04.080
( man screams )

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.780
Fujimaki: TELL ME, NANBU,

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.313
HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?

00:17:07.313 --> 00:17:09.113
( Nanbu gasping )

00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:11.446
Fujimaki:
I'M ASKING YOUR WEIGHT.

00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:12.780
SO HOW MUCH?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.846
( Nanbu stammering )

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:17.613
( man shrieks )

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:21.313
Fujimaki: COME HERE. TRY THIS.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.546
( Nanbu gasps )

00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:43.413
( slams head )

00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:45.913
PLEASE, MR. FUJIMAKI,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

00:17:45.913 --> 00:17:47.446
I'LL FIND A WAY
TO PAY YOU BACK.

00:17:47.446 --> 00:17:50.146
I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME!
I SWEAR TO GOD!

00:17:50.146 --> 00:17:53.146
Fujimaki: I SEE.
IS THAT YOUR ANSWER?

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:56.546
Nanbu: JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE.

00:17:56.546 --> 00:17:58.313
( shuddering )

00:18:01.753 --> 00:18:03.120
Fujimaki: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.486
‐ Nanbu: EH?
‐ Fujimaki: BUT FIRST,

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:09.753
WE'LL NEED TO SETTLE UP
OVER THIS LITTLE INCIDENT.

00:18:09.753 --> 00:18:11.620
JUDGING BY MY LOSS,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.286
I FIGURE THAT OTHER EYEBALL
OF YOURS SHOULD COVER IT.

00:18:17.986 --> 00:18:20.953
Nanbu: UH, AND THE KID?

00:18:20.953 --> 00:18:22.620
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO MY PARTNER?

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.453
Fujimaki: THAT'S THE ACE
UP YOUR SLEEVE, HUH,

00:18:26.453 --> 00:18:30.153
USING YOUR ONLY PIECE
AS A SACRIFICIAL PAWN?

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:32.886
YOU'VE FALLEN LOW,
HAVEN'T YOU, NANBU?

00:18:32.886 --> 00:18:35.386
( Nanbu stammers )

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:36.920
( sighs )

00:18:38.253 --> 00:18:39.653
Fujimaki:
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

00:18:39.653 --> 00:18:43.553
WE'RE GOING TO BE PROFITING
OFF YOUR PARTNER UNTIL HE DIES,

00:18:43.553 --> 00:18:45.553
IN MY RING, OF COURSE.

00:18:45.553 --> 00:18:46.153
Nanbu: EH?

00:18:46.153 --> 00:18:49.853
Junk Dog: YEAH, DEAD SERIOUS.

00:18:49.853 --> 00:18:51.420
PLEASE GET ME IN HIS RING.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.620
Yuri: IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT FIGHTING ME AGAIN,

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.853
THEN YOU COME TO ME...

00:18:56.853 --> 00:18:58.320
IN MY RING.

00:18:59.453 --> 00:19:01.760
Nanbu: HE WANTS
TO GET TO HIS RING.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.293
( heart beating )

00:19:04.693 --> 00:19:06.326
NO WAY.

00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:10.460
MY PARTNER IS NOT GONNA
BE FIGHTING IN YOUR RING!

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.960
( knife rattles )

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.793
NEW PLAN!
I CAN PAY YOU BACK IN FULL

00:19:14.793 --> 00:19:16.293
ONCE HE WINS THIS TOURNAMENT.

00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.093
( Fujimaki chuckles )

00:19:27.326 --> 00:19:29.726
Junk Dog: SO YOU TOLD HIM
WHAT'S WHAT, RIGHT?

00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:30.893
HOW'D IT GO?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.193
YOU LISTENING?
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION, POPS.

00:19:36.193 --> 00:19:38.226
Nanbu: WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP?

00:19:38.226 --> 00:19:40.593
I'M TRYING TO DO
SOME THINKIN' HERE, OKAY?

00:19:40.593 --> 00:19:41.593
STOP INTERRUPTING.

00:19:41.593 --> 00:19:42.360
Junk Dog: HMM.

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:46.993
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

00:19:46.993 --> 00:19:49.260
ARE WE OFF THE HOOK OR NOT?

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.760
Nanbu: TIME FOR MEGALONIA.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.260
Junk Dog: EH?

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.560
Nanbu: YOU HEARD ME.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.400
YOU'RE GETTING EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WANT, YOU LITTLE BASTARD.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.100
WE'VE GOTTA GET INTO MEGALONIA
NOW AND KICK ASS.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.766
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:07.133
( Junk Dog gasps )

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:10.266
YOU MEAN I GET TO FIGHT YURI?

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:12.533
Nanbu: YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?!

00:20:12.533 --> 00:20:16.033
WE ONLY HAVE THREE MONTHS
TO COME OUT ON TOP!

00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:18.433
IN ONLY THREE MONTHS TIME,

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:20.933
WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT
INTO THE TOURNAMENT,

00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:23.033
WE HAVE TO WIN IT.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.400
( Junk Dog chuckles )

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.800
Nanbu: EH?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.200
Junk Dog: NOT A PROBLEM.

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:34.966
I DON'T INTEND TO LOSE AGAIN,

00:20:34.966 --> 00:20:37.200
NOT UNTIL I GET TO FIGHT YURI.

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:40.100
Nanbu: EH...

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.533
( tapping )

00:20:52.533 --> 00:20:55.200
( beeping )

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.040
Man: MAN, POOR GUY.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.340
( chews )
A FEW PAYMENTS LATE,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.440
AND BAM, HE'S CHOPPED APART,
ORGANS ALL SOLD OFF.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.573
NOW HIS WHOLE IDENTITY
IS ABOUT TO BE OVERWRITTEN.

00:21:08.573 --> 00:21:11.273
Fujimaki: THIS IS ALL THE HELP
YOU'LL GET FROM ME.

00:21:11.273 --> 00:21:14.540
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS UP TO THE TWO OF YOU.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.606
YOU GOT THAT, NANBU?

00:21:16.606 --> 00:21:18.140
( beeping )

00:21:19.073 --> 00:21:21.173
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

00:21:21.173 --> 00:21:24.240
WHAT CAN A COUPLE OF FRAUDS
HOPE TO DO?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.206
Nanbu: I'VE GOT ONE HELL
