Maiko was up all night
writing that just for you!

Do you have any decency at all?

Look, it's fine,
it's not a big deal!

Crap.

Come on, say something!

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,291
[HANDA] Kind of weird to get a
challenge from a girl, though.

She might wanna get violent,

323
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,375
but it's not like she's gonna do
it right in the middle of class.

324
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,833
Wouldn't hurt to
hear her out, I guess.

Wait, you mean right here?
Like, in front of everybody?

C'mon, Maiko. Tell him!

Yeah, I thought so.

Don't wanna bully me with all
these witnesses here, do you?

Ahh! She called me out anyway!

00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,291
Now that wasn't so hard!

[HANDA] Ah. Damn it! These girls
really have it out for me.

[HANDA] One... I'm surrounded
by a gang of girls

me into the ground.

I don't take kindly to that!

[HANDA] Or two... Her boyfriend
is the leader of some scary gang

I have to do something
before class ends today!

Check out that aura. Handa's
ready for business, isn't he?

350
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,541
[HANDA] I should've just left
the damn thing in my locker.

351
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,916
Now that she called me out
in front of the whole class,

352
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,666
there's no way I can back down
without looking even worse.

I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away.

I mustn't run away.

If I turn tail now,

00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,958
they'll bully me even worse
for being such a coward!

00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,708
[HANDA]
There's still time.

358
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,750
For now, I'll calm my mind
with some calligraphy.

359
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,125
Handa, I'm teaching
math over here!

360

Oh, her friend with

I know doing calligraphy
is your job, but...

[HANDA] Great, now the teacher's
mad at me for some reason.

Sure.

[HANDA] I could ask her friend.
But from the looks of things

she'd probably just
bite my face off.

a fight with me, anyway?

it's her, not me.

Ah, come on!
Just try to read it!

435
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,041
After all, this is
a letter from Handa!

436
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,166
And that means it's
a rare work of art!

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,291
I think I know this one.
"Love," right?

438
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,541
It's a love letter!

439

So Handa was in love
with me all along?

440

None of this makes any sense!
I must have it wrong!

But it looks like
he wrote "body."

442
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,625
And I think that says "face"...

443
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,875
...and "love"!

00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,541
Uh! Uh, sure!

465
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,583
[JURI]
Ah, crap! Is Handa here? Nope!

466
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,250
Did you bring a lunchbox today?

467
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,083
Uhh, yeah, of course.
Just like always.

468
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,916
Wow! That is the
cutest thing ever!

469
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,666
Like pearls before swine!

470
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,041
[JURI] Uh. Wait a sec.
Did she just diss me?

471
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,500
[MAIKO]
Ooh, I gotta try one!

472
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,666
Hey! Who said you could
eat my penguin rice balls?

473
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,291
It sure is awesome how
you give me food, Juri.

474
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,958
You're like my mom or something.

475
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,583
That's how it is?

476
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,458
[JURI]
Did she always suck this much?

477
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,500
'Cause she's really
pissing me off!

[MAIKO]
Wow! You're like a gorilla!

479
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,583
[JURI] Now that I think about
it, did I ever like this girl?

480
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,041
Have I ever had fun
with her, even once?

481
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,458
Hey, quick question...

482
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,041
Why exactly is it that you
hang out with me, anyway?

483
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,166
[MAIKO]
Hm? That came out of nowhere.

484
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,708
You could probably make way
more popular friends,

485
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,041
and cuter ones, too.

486
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,250
Come on. Why would you
think something like that?

487
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,958
Don't be silly! I feel
safe with you around!

488
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,541
I don't need anybody else.

489
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,250
That's sweet of you.

490
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,583
Standing next to you makes
me look super pretty.

491
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,541
I couldn't imagine having a
friend who was cuter than me!

492
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,208
[JURI] Okay, that settles
it--you're not getting Handa!

Good luck in your

[HANDA] She didn't come.
What happened?

497
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,500
Why?! What was wrong
with my letter?

498
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,291
It was crystal clear!

Um, Handa?

Nope. He is not listening.

I'm dead!

I'll just run away.

Yeah, but Handa hasn't left yet.

hyped up about it.

They left us with
a cliffhanger, too!

If you hadn't wasted all
that time in the first half,

too meta, all right?

A little late for that!

with our Handa anime?
