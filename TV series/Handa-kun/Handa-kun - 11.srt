00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:12,208
[SAWAKO]
The school cultural festival

2
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,333
not only marks the
coming of autumn,

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,291
it shows the pride that we
have for this institution.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,250
It celebrates the
strength and friendship

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,458
that we have nurtured
during the past semester.

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,000
Therefore, to better capture
our feelings of comradery,

7
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,791
I've decided to give
the festival a new name.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,333
[STUDENTS chattering]

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,458
It will hereby be known
as the Handa Festival!

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,916
[STUDENT COUNCIL]
Too obvious!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Like, not subtle at all!

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,458
[STUDENT COUNCIL 11D] Forget
that. What's with her hair?

13
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,500
[STUDENT COUNCIL 11E]
I was afraid to mention it.

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,750
It's a beautiful name,
don't you think?

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,125
It has nothing to do with
Sei Handa, of course.

16
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,291
"Han" notates "half"--

17
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,208
celebrating the first
half of our lives.

18
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,041
And "Da" is the
character for "paddy"--

19
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,666
honoring our
rice-farming heritage.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,208
[STUDENT COUNCIL]
Just give it up.

21
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,291
I like your passion, but we
can't use a student's name.

22
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,750
[SAWAKO] I'm telling you,
it's just a coincidence, okay?

23
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,125
[AIZAWA] Handa's souvenir
game is really on point.

24
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,750
He won the president's heart
with a single hairpin.

25
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,583
Whatever our class
does for the festival,

26
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,416
we'll be the stars of
the show, for sure.

27
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,333
[AIZAWA]
After a bit of negotiation,

28
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,416
the president withdrew
her suggestion.

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,375
And thus the "Seishu
Festival" was born,

30
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,458
with its totally original name.

31
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,666
[MORI]
Isn't "Seishu" Handa's pen name?

32
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,916
[OOTANI] The word is
"pseudonym," bro. Learn it.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,958
[ISHIDA]
Seriously?

34
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,458
[HANDA]
I want to go home.

35
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,250
Anyway, since the festival just
so happens to share a name

36
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,750
with our very own class rep,
we're all but obligated

37
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,916
to take the "Best Class
Award" this year.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,125
With that in mind,

39
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,291
any suggestions for
our classroom activity?

40
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,833
Oh, I know! It's obvious, right?
We gotta go with a maid cafe.

41
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:07,916
[STUDENT 11A]
Not on your life!

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,250
[STUDENT 11B]
Keep dreaming!

43
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,041
Does that mean you're okay
with wearing a dress?

44
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,666
Yeah, I'd look good.

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,625
Instead of some pansy maid café,

46
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,375
we should do a street
fighting café!

47
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,791
I can see it now.

48
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,125
[HANDA]
How does that work?

49
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,083
I think putting on a play
would be way more fun!

50
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,125
We should totally do
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> .

51
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,541
I can sew the costumes,
no problem!

52
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,791
I was cool with maid
outfits, but actually,

53
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,583
I might be even
hotter as Juliet.

54
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,166
Why would you be Juliet, dude?

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,500
You really want to wear
a dress, don't you?

56
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,125
Well, I'm cuter than all
the girls, so why not?

57
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,166
Sorry, but you're the only
one who thinks that.

58
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,791
[REO]
Who's cuter than me, huh? Who?

59
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,041
Any ideas, Yuki?

60
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,500
Let me think. A haunted house?

61
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,750
So cliché.

62
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,416
And you thought a
maid café was bad.

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,583
[MORI]
We should come up with something

64
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,666
that really makes
our class star shine!

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,541
[OOTANI] Yeah, but if the rest
of the class does nothing,

66
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,416
it'll make him look bad.

67
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,833
[HANDA]
Who's the "class star?"

68
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,916
--[ISHIDA] Let's do a barbecue!
--[SAITO] A host club!

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,416
[HAYASHI]
Storytelling!

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
--[WADA] Zombie makeovers!
--[TAKAYAMADA] Maybe a museum?

71
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,250
[HANDA]
This is going to take all day.

72
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,166
I'm supposed to meet
with Kawafuji later, too.

73
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,416
[AIZAWA]
...we should let him decide!

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,083
[gasps]

75
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,583
Yeah, you're right.

76
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,750
He might as well, since he gets
the final say in all this.

77
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,916
[HANDA]
Huh? I do?

78
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,208
[AIZAWA]
Okay, simple enough.

79
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,666
We narrowed it down to these
three, so just go with your gut,

80
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,583
and we'll be fine, Handa.

81
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,208
[HANDA]
My gut wants to go home.

82
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,500
Or you can take your
precious time, if you like.

83
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,125
We can wait right here all
day and all night, too.

84
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,666
[HANDA]
No pressure, huh?

85
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,625
[HANDA] Well, this one is
the obvious choice for me,

86
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,041
but I have the feeling
it's so obvious

87
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,583
everyone else will complain.

88
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,041
Nobody wants to see me
in a dress. Me included.

89
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,708
And I couldn't act
to save my life.

90
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,458
[HANDA groans]

91
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,375
[KONDO]
Handa looks super stressed out.

92
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,958
There's gotta be
something I can do.

93
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,750
[KONDO]
Hey, Handa?

94
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,583
[HANDA] It's that guy
who keeps picking on me!

95
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,416
You like musicals
a bunch, don't you?

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
[STUDENTS gasp]

97
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,333
[HANDA] What the hell are you
saying, you serial harasser?

98
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,833
You like musicals?
Wow, Handa, I never knew.

99
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,583
[HANDA]
Uh, no, no, no.

100
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,708
[KONDO] Musicals are super
popular these days.

101
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,000
If we do one together
as a class,

102
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,875
I'm sure you'll make
a lot of friends!

103
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,416
[HANDA]
Are you starting a fight?

104
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,833
Huh. That one's a surprise,
but I'll put it up on the board.

105
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,250
[HANDA] Damn it!
Don't give me more choices!

106
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,333
Now I really am gonna
be here all night.

107
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,916
I don't want to keep Kawafuji
waiting at the café again!

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,708
Aw... The café.

109
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,166
[AIZAWA] Oh, so you want
the maid café after all?

110
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,500
[STUDENTS yelling]

111
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,791
[HIROE]
Handa's gonna be a maid?

112
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,041
[IKEUCHI]
Aw! I wanted the play!

113
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,916
[ISHIDA]
Can we at least be butlers?

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,083
[AIZAWA]
So, not the café?

115
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,500
[HANDA]
Bathroom break!

116
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,833
[AIZAWA] Handa? You think
it was something we said?

117
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,291
I think he just
got stressed out,

118
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,083
'cause everyone in the class
was yelling at once.

119
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,333
Handa is a man among men,
he'd never submit to stress.

120
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,541
I dunno. I like his
sensitive side, too!

121
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,125
We made the same
mistake again,

122
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,791
forcing Handa to decide
for everyone.

123
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,416
[BTOH] Don't blame us!
That was all you, dude.

124
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,041
But if Handa couldn't
make a call,

125
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,833
there's no way we can
do it on our own.

126
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,833
Why don't we just do a show
of hands like normal?

127
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,000
Handa's sudden retreat
was intended to bring us

128
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,166
to that very conclusion!

129
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,375
[HANDA]
This sucks.

130
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,125
I mean, I know I can't please
everyone, no matter what I do.

131
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,375
They asked my opinion.

132
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,458
So of course, I'd like
to do calligraphy.

133
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,333
But I feel like I'm the
only person in the class

134
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,250
who would care about that.

135
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,333
[SAWAKO] It seems something
is troubling you, Handa.

136
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,000
Perhaps I could be of help?

137
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,958
[HANDA] Whoa. What's
happening with her hair?

138
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,875
There's no need to be shy.

139
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,250
I promise I won't
make you wear a skirt.

140
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,583
[HANDA]
Seriously. What?

141
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,208
Has your class decided
on an activity yet?

142
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,500
Uh, we're working on that.

143
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,708
[SAWAKO] It's difficult
to lead people sometimes.

144
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,208
[HANDA]
That hair...

145
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,875
[SAWAKO] Sometimes an unpopular
decision is the right one.

146
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,666
[HANDA]
So weird!

147
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,833
That's fine.

148
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,750
It's a leader's burden
to suffer scorn

149
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,291
for the sake of a revolution.

150
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,083
[HANDA] I think your hair is
suffering for a revolution.

151
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,333
I need... to ask
a favor of you.

152
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,583
Uh?

153
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,333
Could you paint
the festival sign

154
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,625
for the front of the school?

155
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,041
And the pamphlets as well,
if you don't mind.

156
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,583
Um.

157
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,375
I realize you're a professional
calligrapher and everything,

158
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,916
so it may be rude to make
such a selfish request.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,416
Of course you're free to
refuse if that's not okay.

160
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,958
Sounds perfect.

161
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,375
So even though you're really
famous, you still don't mind?

162
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,833
[HANDA]
Not at all.

163
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,875
At last, a worthy legacy to
leave behind as president.

164
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,541
[HANDA] If I said no,
she'd probably flip out.

165
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,500
All right Handa,
it's a promise.

166
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,541
I'll give you the materials
later. Have a nice day!

167
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,208
[HANDA]
Okay.

168
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:24,375
I'm really grateful. [laughing]

169
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,208
[HANDA]
She means that, doesn't she?

170
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,958
I bet she got a lot of flack
for involving me at all.

171
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,208
That must have been one of
those "unpopular decisions"

172
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,125
she was talking about.

173
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,625
[HANDA grunts]

174
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,083
[HANDA] She gave me just
the perspective I needed.

175
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,166
If they want me to decide,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

176
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,791
It's calligraphy lessons
or nothing. Deal with it!

177
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,291
Listen!

178
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,333
[HANDA]
Hm?

179
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,500
Hey Handa.

180
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,958
Don't worry, we made our
decision, so everyone went home.

181
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,958
It was clear that the
only logical choice

182
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,375
was a musical Romeo
and Juliet Café.

183
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,666
Also with maids.

184
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,000
[buzzer]

185
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,250
Why'd you cross out
the calligraphy class?

186
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,333
Not everyone's as good
at calligraphy as you.

187
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,958
So that option made the
least amount of sense.

188
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,166
[AIZAWA]
Now there's no pressure on you.

189
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,541
Right. It doesn't make sense.

190
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,041
[HANDA]
The one thing I can do!

191
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,458
Okay! Gonna be long
hours starting tomorrow,

192
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:23,000
so get a good night's rest
and be ready to work hard!

193
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,166
[KAWAFUJI] Our class couldn't
make a call either,

194
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,250
so I just went with my gut.

195
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,041
We're doing calligraphy
with super-sized brushes.

196
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,000
Uh! I really wish I
was you right now.

197
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,125
[laughs] Being me
is pretty great.

198
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,333
Can't blame you for
that one. [laughs]

199
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,458
[HANDA sighs] This is
the last free afternoon

200
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,958
I'll have in a while.

201
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,416
I'll practically be
living at the school.

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,833
Hope I can get along with
the rest of the class.

203
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,041
[RAI] You expect me
to believe that crap?

204
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,791
[BROW-BOY]
C'mon chump, just do it.

205
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,375
[screaming] Somebody help me!

206
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,375
[SHAVE] Give it up. Nobody's
here and nobody's coming.

207
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,541
[HANDA] They're mugging him!

208
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,125
Should I call for help?
Or is it too late?

209
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,791
Uh?

210
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,791
[HANDA] Nice timing! I've never
been so happy to see you!

211
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,458
You love beating up guys
from other schools, right?

212
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,208
Well, here's your chance, pal!

213
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,500
Don't just stand there!
Help him out already!

214
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,208
[HANDA]
Wait. Did they just say my name?

215
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,500
[TSUTSUI] Why isn't Handa
tearing those punks a new one?

216
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,958
He could, like, sneeze and
they'd hit the ground running.

217
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,458
Wait. Sneeze? Maybe he's sick.

218
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,250
[HANDA] Are you gonna kick
their asses or not? C'mon!

219
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,083
You got a crick in
your neck, don't you?

220
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,083
I'm gesturing for
you to go fight!

221
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,583
[TSUTSUI] Okay, that does make
more sense. Leave it to me!

222
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,458
[ALL]
Huh?

223
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,833
[TSUTSUI grunts]

224
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,916
[RAI]
Who the hell are--

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,791
[BROW-BOY]
Cut it out!

226
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
[HANDA]
There! Now was that so hard?

227
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,333
[SKELETOR]
It's a monster!

228
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,833
[HANDA]
Also, am I nuts

229
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,875
or was he like... waiting
for my approval almost?

230
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,375
Listen up!

231
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,750
We're starting on the costumes,
so everyone get measured!

232
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,583
[STUDENTS]
Okay!

233
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,166
[HANDA]
It's getting late.

234
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,750
I'm gonna be here until
after dark for sure.

235
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,083
What if those street
thugs are out there?

236
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:02,958
What if I run into them?

237
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,083
[IKEUCHI, HIROE]
Um, Handa?

238
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:04,958
[HANDA]
Uh?

239
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,125
I know you're busy right now,

240
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,833
but do you mind if we
measure you first?

241
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,000
Take off your jacket

242
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,625
and I promise it'll
be over in a flash.

243
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,416
[HANDA]
Uh, sure.

244
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,208
[IKEUCHI] You don't have to feel
awkward. I'm a professional.

245
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,500
Okay, maybe that's an
exaggeration.

246
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,500
But I do hope I can work in
the fashion industry someday.

247
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,708
Huh.

248
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,958
And I wanna sell clothes
in a cool boutique.

249
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,083
Well... Not that that's relevant
to you, but whatever.

250
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,041
[HANDA]
I guess it isn't relevant, no.

251
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,916
Still. When I hear
you talk like that,

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,958
I want to do my best too.

253
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,250
[IKEUCHI, HIROE gasp]
He's so cool!

254
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,500
[HANDA] I'll give this festival
sign everything I've got!

255
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,666
Hey guys, I called
some old industry pals

256
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,333
and found a place that'll donate
the fabric for our costumes,

257
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,750
so feel free to worship me!

258
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,833
[STUDENTS gasping]

259
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,375
All that's left is
to pick out a menu

260
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,125
and get a license to sell food.

261
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,041
Um. Can I do something to help?

262
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,125
No. Just sit down
and take it easy.

263
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,250
You're the class rep, so all
you need to do is supervise.

264
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,333
[HANDA]
They pushed me away again.

265
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,416
[KONDO]
Wow, that's nice.

266
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,041
[HANDA]
This is so boring.

267
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,291
[clattering]

268
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,916
[HANDA] I'm sure they just
want me out of their hair,

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,750
but when they do
stuff like this,

270
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,833
it almost feels like they're
treating me nicely.

271
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,416
[IKEUCHI, HIROE]
Bye-bye!

272
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,875
[TSUTSUI] Guys, make sure you
see all the ladies home safe!

273
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,666
[OKAYAMA]
Be careful out there, okay?

274
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,916
[STUDENTS]
Okay.

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
[KONDO]
I hope Handa's okay with this.

276
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,750
[TSUTSUI]
He's tired. Let him rest.

277
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,375
[REO] Watching a whole
class wears you out

278
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,833
more than you'd think.

279
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,416
[AIZAWA] We need him in tip-top
shape for the festival.

280
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,375
[HANDA snores, gasps]

281
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,875
[HANDA] Aw... Was waking
me up that much trouble?

282
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,083
[HANDA gasps]

283
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,250
Finally!

284
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,791
It's been a pain, but somebody
has to put him in his place.

285
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,500
[SHAVE] Our school has the best
thugs in the whole nation!

286
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,625
He's screwed!

287
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,750
[RAI] Yeah, and he's
all alone too. Go!

288
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,958
[GUYS] You think you're bad?
We'll show you!

289
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,708
[gasps]

290
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,958
[hisses]

291
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,791
[fighting, grunting]

292
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,000
[HANDA] More street thugs.
Don't look. Don't look!

293
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,083
[HANDA] Hm... I feel like
some of these designs

294
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,541
are pretty interesting,

295
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,791
but I don't know if they work
for a school festival.

296
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,041
No one cares who wrote it,

297
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,791
so I might as well go
with something legible,

298
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,083
rather than something I'd do
for a calligraphy competition.

299
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,375
Okay! I think this is the one.

300
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,458
[NEO] Behold! The Handa- <i>chan</i>
special in all its glory!

301
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,958
3-D girls can take a hike,
this is where it's at!

302
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,083
It staves off my
crushing loneliness!

303
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,541
[chuckles]

304
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,041
[PSYCHO] How many do we need
to sell to save the club?

305
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,500
[TAKOYAKI] Two hundred is
usually pretty good, right?

306
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,041
Our school has about 500
students and I assume

307
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,166
that they'll buy five
copies each, so...

308
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,708
...I ordered 5,000!

309
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,375
[PSYCHO]
That is way too optimistic!

[TAKOYAKI] Also, you don't
know how to do math at all!

311

Okay, time to
practice our lines.

312
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,333
Our librarian here cooked up
these brilliant scripts for us!

313
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm not even in this class.
Someone please set me free.

314
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,625
Hey, Aizawa!

315
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,541
What's up with this
crackpot casting?

316
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,541
Why the hell am I Juliet?!

317
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,041
This is a travesty.
I'm the cute one here!

318
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,416
Tsutsui as Juliet
is obviously funny--

319
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,083
with you, everyone will
just roll their eyes.

320

[REO]
They will?

321
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,375
[TSUTSUI] Oh, so you're trying
to make a laughingstock

322
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,791
out of me, is that it?

323
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,541
If you don't want
people to laugh at you,

324
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,875
then get small again.

325
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,708
Your transformation will
be the key to our victory!

326
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,291
What exactly are you
expecting of me?

327
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,500
While we're at it, what's up
with your role? King Lear?

328
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
[TSUTSUI]
I don't remember him.

329
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,375
You wrote him in just
so you could be king!

330
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,333
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
doesn't have enough parts

331
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,000
for the whole class. So, we
added some notable characters

332
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,166
from Shakespeare's other famous
works to round things out.

333

lame, white tights?

335

'Cause... ew.

341
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,916
Oh, it's very regal.

342

Wait till you see the
costume. You'll love it.

343

Your job isn't to
sweat the details,

344
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,458
it's to look after the class,

345
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,625

her children, okay?

Dear Handa...

349
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,625
[IKEUCHI] I just realized,
Handa's gonna need a wig.

[HIROE] I'm thinking like...
a light brown color?

353

Something with a
natural wave to it.

354
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,791

Needs to be pretty long.

[AIZAWA] We're fine.
What about your class?

362
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,083
[HANADA] We've got it easy,
thanks to my special talent.

363
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,541
We're doing celebrity
look-alike makeovers.

The catch is...
I can only do Handa.

Hey, why would you
wanna do anyone else?

Now you can make even
more fake Handas!

on me as a warmup?

[AIZAWA]
You can go third, Yuki.

still feel like I haven't made

impressed with our Handa faces?

left and never came back.
