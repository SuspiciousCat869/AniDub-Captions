Sei Handa.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,458
A second year
high school student.

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,875
His father, Seimei Handa,

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,958
is a famous name in the
world of calligraphy.

6
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,250
So it's little surprise

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,458
that his son is a prodigy
in the art as well.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,083
Wherever he walks, people
naturally clear the path.

00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,833
Men gaze upon him with envy.

10

Women gaze upon
him with longing.

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,250
Or something like that.

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,000
[JURI]
So you came after all. Good.

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,125
I don't know what this is all
about, but make it quick.

Huh? Is that a joke?

How could you possibly
not know what this about?

Subtlety isn't my
strongest point.

That is such a cool line.

make them come out and say it.

He must get this a lot.

[HANDA] On the upside, looks
like it's just these two.

No gangster boyfriends,

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,250
so it's probably just
a verbal smack down.

23
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,541
I can do this.

24
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,333

you'll find the answer,

Well, I can't tell anything.

The truth is, my soul
was tainted by jealousy.

He just said your handwriting
was bad, that's all.

But handwriting's
everything to Handa!

How about you and I learn
calligraphy together, then?

Wha...?

And once our handwriting
is all pretty,

133

we can write Handa a new love
letter, what do you say?

Your handwriting
is already cute,

to lose Handa to you.

[JURI] Yeah? We'll see
about that, won't we?

140
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,625
[MAIKO laughs] Okay, but
we're still friends, right?

Uh. Best friends
to the very end!

My name is Junichi Aizawa.

I have maintained my role as

Since I have served

I assumed that my position

We'll hold a secret ballot,

so there's no hard feelings.

Huh, what?

00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,791
[AIZAWA growls]

159
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,625
[AIZAWA]
Why am I so anxious?

160
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,333
My victory is practically
assured after all.

161
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,083
What a fool you are to
challenge me, Handa!

162
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,625
What could you possibly
hope to gain?

163
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,750
You'll regret this!

164
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,666
[HANDA] Some jerk must have
nominated me after I dozed off.

165
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,625
Being a class rep
is a real pain.

166
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,875
We should make Handa do it.

167
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,791
It's not like he's in
any clubs or anything,

168
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,250
so I'm sure he has time.

169
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,208
[HANDA]
I let my guard down.

170
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,791
I did everything in my power

171
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,708
to stop people from
nominating me, too!

172
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,125
But if I try to give up now,
I'll just look like a coward.

173
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,583
That Aizawa guy must
be in same boat.

174
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,000
Sorry man, I feel ya.

175
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,708
[AIZAWA]
Hm? Is that a look of pity?

176
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,458
You think your popularity will
triumph over my intelligence?

177
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,208
[OKAYAMA]
Let's count the votes... Aizawa.

Handa.

Aizawa.

183
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,833
Aizawa. A- A- A-

184
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,916
[AIZAWA]
I've never felt such a thrill!

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,291
Will this battle
bring glory or defeat?

186
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,000
Every vote is like a lightning
bolt to my heart!

187
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,958
In gratitude and in despair,
I feel their weight!

188
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,375
Knowing that he feels the same,

189
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,916
I share a wordless
bond with my rival!

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,583
We are the chosen ones!

191
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,625
None other can
understand our burden!

192
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,000
[OKAYAMA]
And the last one goes to Handa.

193
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,833
Huh? It's a tie.

194

[HANDA, AIZAWA gasp]

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,583
[MIYAMAE]
We have 22 students total,

196
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,166
but one of them
never comes to class.

197
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,375
How could we have a tie?

198
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,125
Oh, I voted in his place.

199
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,666
I didn't think he
would mind too much.

200

[MIYAMAE]
Well, you're the teacher.

Wait, so who did he vote for?

202
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,208
What should we do now?

203
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,583
[HANDA] This is my chance
to be free of this mess!

204
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,750
If I bow out now,
it won't look so bad!

205
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,458
I, uh--

206
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,666
We need answers!

207
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,000
Both Handa and I are here

208
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,208
because of our earnest
desire to lead this class!

209
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,250
We're having a serious
battle between men!

210
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,541
Don't take this
situation lightly!

211
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,416
[HANDA]
Actually, I--

212
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
[OKAYAMA]
Fair enough.

213
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,416
How about rock-
paper-scissors, then?

214
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,791
I said "battle"! Not "game"!

[HANDA]
They're not listening.

216

I like it. At least it's quick.

217
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:19,916
Might as well.

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
[AIZAWA]
This isn't a joke!

219
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,541
Another vote would just
turn out the same, so--

220
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,375
And you're both
qualified, right?

in advance? To deceive me?

me into thinking

think I'm a liar?

"one bout to decide

serious business, sir?!

to this, but I'll just
see how it plays out.

--[STUDENTS] Whoa!

[AIZAWA]
He's smiling?

268
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,583
How far did he plan this out?
I can't get inside his head.

269
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,833
Maybe I should do rock myself

270
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,708
and hope for a tie
to buy some time.

271
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,333
They say that people
tend to favor paper,

272
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,750
so scissors is the safest bet.

273
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,083
But if Handa indeed
puts out rock,

274
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,208
I'm the one choosing
the obvious "paper."

275
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,583
Then he'll trap me
by playing "scissors,"

276
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,625
so I should do rock,

277
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,625
only if he does
live up to his word,

278
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,666
then the suffering
will never end!

279
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,708
There must be some way for me
to cut through this dilemma.

severed was my own lifeline...

[OKAYAMA]
I don't want to get my hopes up,

286
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,625
but maybe this will
teach you something.

287
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,916
Okay, once again, Handa
is the new class rep.

W-Wait a sec!

00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,083
Save it. There's no way
we're doing best of five.

290
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,083

[HANDA]
I see...

292
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,833
He made me think he
wanted the position.

293
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,583
Then when I took pity on him,
he dumped the whole thing on me.

294
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,166
And now that he's
pretending to cry,

295
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,583
I can't complain without
looking like a jerk.

296
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,708
I fell right into your trap.

297
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,333
I guess I'm stupid after all.

298
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,416
It's my fault.
This only happened

299
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,916
because I couldn't put my
faith in other people!

did play rock every time.

is a man of his word, huh?

[HANDA] My already crappy school
life just got even worse.

303
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,791
Now, the teacher
and the students

304
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,791
will both have me on a
leash for the whole year!

305
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,708
I didn't want to resort to this,
since it makes me look bad, but-

306
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,333
[OKAYAMA]
Hm? Yes, what is it...
