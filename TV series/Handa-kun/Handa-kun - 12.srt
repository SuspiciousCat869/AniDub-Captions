00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,333
That's really gonna mess
everyone up though, isn't it?

159
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,583
They might get mad.

160
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,500
No, I don't care!
It's my last chance!

161
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,166
I wanna show them
what I can do.

162
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,125
Whether it's awkward or not!

163
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,166
[door opens]

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,583

All right, guess this is it.

00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,125
Hey! Anybody in here?

167
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,916
This is Class Seven;
you think they tricked us?

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,166
[SHAVE]
Nah. They didn't seem too smart.

169
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
[HANDA]
The customers are here already?

170
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,125
My cue is a knock on the wall.
I'll say my line then.

171
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,333
Just calm down and
wait for the knock.

172
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,583
They should be
back soon enough.

173
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,125
Are you sure this is how
you wanna do this, Rai?

174
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,833
It doesn't feel right
putting our leader

175
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,875
out on the front line.

176
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,875
Nah, man. This is the only way.

177
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:02,416
This high school has the entire
area in the palm of its hand.

178
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,458
We lost a lot of our old turf
when that Tsutsui guy showed up.

179
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,541
But Handa is the
real mastermind.

180
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,625
We gotta do this...

181
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,541
[HANDA]
They knock, then I say my line.

[ALL]
Hm?

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,625
[ICHIMIYA]
How odd. Did I miss the memo,

186
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:23,375
or do all low-class goons attend
theater productions these days?

187
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,500
Shiro High, huh?

188
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,708
[footsteps]

189
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,125
[REO] Those guys from
Shiro are here, too!

190
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,291
[AIZAWA]
This could get messy!

191
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,500
I don't know their intentions,

192
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,416
but they don't get along
with Kuro either!

193
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,666
Your accessories are ruining
your credibility here.

194
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,125
If we don't stop them,

195
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,958
this could be a three-way
standoff with Handa!

196
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,375
You brought your whole gang
here to disrupt the festival,

197
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,041
because you're afraid of a
single student that goes here?

198
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,541
Some people have
no manners at all.

199
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah?

200
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,583
Like the spoiled rich boy
throwin' his weight around?

201
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,375
'Cause I sure as hell didn't
ask for a lecture from you.

202
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,500
How dare you speak
to him that way!

203
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,750
We're not here to fight.

204
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,000
Since Handa is involved,
if we cause a ruckus,

205
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,625
it may reflect poorly on him.

206
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,250
It's not like I'm
arguing with you,

207
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,125
but you're kind of turning into
Aizawa junior these days.

208
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,666
[JOMOTO grunts]
Fighting is bad?

209
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,916
Ask that before you
start throwing punches!

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,416
I feel like we've seen
this scenario before.

211
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,625
[JOMOTO] I just did
what Tsutsui would do.

212
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,791
Wait, I forgot, now
what did they do next?

213
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,291
Ugh, they ran away!

214
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,375
Oh no, you don't!

You just dug your own graves.

Handa may be a worthy rival,

218
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,750
but you're nothin' but a
bunch of spoiled rich brats.

Ha, ha! Oh, you think so?

[JOMOTO]
Uh...

00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,166
Does that mean he was
listening this entire time?

237
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,083
We should all be
ashamed of ourselves.

238
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,166
We nearly ruined their school
festival by hurling insults

239
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,333
and fighting like children.

240
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,458
Truth is... we didn't
come here to brawl,

241
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,500
we came here to
surrender to Handa.

242
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,291
Surrender?!

243
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,541
[SHAVE]
Ever since he showed up,

244
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,458
our school's gotten
weaker and weaker.

245
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,458
We used to have pride in our
thuggery, but what are we now?

246
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,916
[BROW-BOY]
If we can't rule the streets,

247
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,708
then we might as well
live in peace.

248
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,791
Of course, we had to find a way
to meet with Handa first.

249
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,791
We didn't want trouble.

250
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,000
It all makes sense now.

251
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
This must have been
a difficult decision

252
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,541
for a school that prides
itself on strength.

253

Thugs have a code
as well, I suppose.

I respect your humility,

your school, as well...

unintentionally poignant words,

262
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,416
the long-standing rivalry
between Shiro and Kuro High

was brought to an end.

it passed in a flash,

went over pretty well, too.

Yeah, but Handa's
the only reason

anyone gives a damn
about calligraphy.

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
because I had confidence
in Handa's victory,

469
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,750
but it would have been
awkward if he lost.

470
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,666
This level of obsession is
exactly what I expect from you!

471
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,958
[STUDENTS cheering]

472
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,833
This felt positive at first, but
now it's getting kind of weird.

473
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,791
Uh, yeah. No kidding.

474
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,875
But even if they show
it in a creepy way,

475
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,208
the point is that
everyone likes you.

476

[STUDENTS]
Honda! Honda!

477
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,875
I guess so, but...

478
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,208
...weren't you the one who
said they all hated me?

479
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,041
Did I? I don't remember that.

480
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,250
Well, I do!

481
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,041
In fact, it kind of
wrecked my whole life!

482
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,625
Oh, yeah? [laughs]

483
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,833
[AIZAWA] Handa! Why don't
you ride on the float?

484
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,083
Huh? But why?

485
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,208
Because you're the star!

486
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,458
Try it out!

487
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,708
It'll be fun!

488
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,791
Yeah, come on!

00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,333

[STUDENTS scream]

499

If I was on that,
I'd be dead right now.

500
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,875
I mean, sure, but let's
not think of it that way.

501
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,125
It's beautiful! Don't you think?

502
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,500
Huh?!

503
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,166
Oh, man. I can feel his warmth.
I can see his light!

[HANDA]
Uh?

505
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,166
He's like a god of fire.

Huh?!

[KAWAFUJI laughs]

508
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,333
Well... that's okay.

[NEWSCASTER 12A]
A fire broke out

511
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,458
at a local school
festival last night.

512
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,958
But despite the large number
of students in the area,

513
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,291
no injuries were reported.

Whoa, what are you doing here?

517
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,958
Can't we let all this
cool down a bit first?

518
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,583
I mean, what if
someone else sees you?

519
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,833
Why don't you ask her?

520
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,250
Uh!

521
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,041
So, how am I
supposed to act now?

[KAWAFUJI]
Hm? What d'you mean?

I just...

I don't really know what
the rules are anymore.

[KAWAFUJI]
Just be yourself.

Break down that wall the
same way you did last night.
