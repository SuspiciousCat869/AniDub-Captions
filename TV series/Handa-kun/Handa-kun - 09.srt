00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,375
My name is Hideo Okayama.

2
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,416
I'm the teacher in
charge of Class Seven,

3
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,708
also known as "Handa's Class".

4
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,708
To be frank, it's a
mixed blessing at best.

5
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,000
I bet he keeps the
other kids in line.

6
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,666
[OKAYAMA]
Some teachers are envious.

[TEACHER 9B grunting]

8
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,625
[OKAYAMA]
Others are, uh...

9
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,000
The point is,

10
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,541
I refuse to have my life
swayed by a single student.

11
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,583
For the students,
school is its own world,

12
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,208
so it's easy for
them to place Handa

13
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,458
at the center of it
in a fit of fancy.

14
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,208
But I have bigger problems.

15
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,541
No way!

16
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,875
What do you mean we can't
dissect frogs anymore?!

17
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,208
I was about to lose
the only cool part

18
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,875
about being a biology teacher.

19
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,291
This is wrong!

20
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,166
Don't you know how much I
look forward to this ev--

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,833
I mean how important this is?!

[croaks]

23
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,666
Sorry. But we've received
a great number

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,500
of complaints from parents.
Also, we always have girls

25
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,375
who get sick and go
to the nurse's office.

26
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,958
No good.

27
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,166
[OKAYAMA] Who cares?! They still
need to learn! It's important!

28
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,750
Looking at a frog's insides,

29
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,583
then wondering if your insides
look that icky-gooey, too.

30
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,833
Doesn't that excite you?

31
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,833
No, it's gross!

32
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,750
[OKAYAMA] This is hopeless.
And what a hypocrite!

33
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,958
He wants the students
to value their lives,

34
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,833
but not learn about organs?

35
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,166
What does he think is keeping
them alive in the first place?

36
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,583
[sighs]

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,916
[OKAYAMA] I just want to give
them a taste of reality!

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,083
[OKAYAMA]
Hm?

39
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,041
It's Handa.

40
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,375
Even if you're popular,

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,916
you still have the same
organs as everybody else!

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,791
Uh! Hold on. Maybe he can help!

43
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,791
If he gets behind
the dissection,

44
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,666
then all the other students
will follow suit!

45

[OKAYAMA]
Handa!

[AIZAWA]
Hm?

[OKAYAMA]
Mm. And, Aizawa.

49
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,458

[clears throat]

51

[OKAYAMA] Boys love doing cruel
and disgusting things, right?

52
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,416
I'm sure they'll
see things my way!

53
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,958
Handa, you're looking forward
to dissecting frogs in class,

54
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,583
aren't you?

55
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,000
Uh!

56
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,291
I'm confused, sir.

57
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,875
I thought that lesson
was canceled

58
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,666
because we received
too many complaints.

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,916
It was.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,291
Though I really don't
want you all to miss out

61
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,250
on such an important exercise.

[HANDA] I know my mom

[HANDA'S MOM]
Nope.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's only a few parents
that are causing the fuss.

66
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,500
I agree that it's a valuable
part of our study.

00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,333
Uh!

[gasps]

69
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,625
[AIZAWA] Lately schools
have been prohibiting

70
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,791
anything controversial

71
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,166
in the name of
"protecting the children."

Aizawa!

73
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,375
Finally a student with
real passion for learning!

I'm so glad to have you!

75
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,291
[HANDA] The school already
decided. Just give it up.

76
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,875
[AIZAWA]
If people object to the frog,

77
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,375
perhaps we could dissect
a fish, instead?

78
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,000
[OKAYAMA] We're not making
sushi, we're learning biology.

79
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,083
I think we can still
fight for the frog.

80
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,833
[HANDA] Why do you want
to dissect frogs so badly?

81
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,375
Okay, here's the plan.

82
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,833
We'll collect signatures from
everyone who wants to do it!

With your help,

we'll be knee deep in frog
guts in no time at all!

won't bow down,

Don't need to cut up a frog
to see the same thing. Right?

What if I get frog juice
on my hands? Gross.

We have to go through
with the frog dissection!

this whole frog thing.

a while to fully set in.

In the meantime,
everyone can line up

That's quite a collection
you've gathered!

Normally it's five

The controversy inspired me to
catch a bunch of these guys!

Overpopulating the area made

If we wanna protect
him from the stalker,

318
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,416
why don't we just
walk next to him

319
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,458

320
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,666
Blasphemy!

321

Does your arrogance know
no bounds, you fool?

322
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,541
The Handa Force does not aspire
to be equals with Handa.

the definition of "shady!"

If Handa has a stalker,
it's definitely her!

339
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,250
Like the Handa Force, she
understands boundaries.

340
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,958
Let's just say she
keeps some of the more

[AIZAWA] If someone seeks
special attention from Handa,

344
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,458
she drags them back
into the shadows.

345
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,458

I guess Handa isn't
taking this path today.

that the bookworm?

come to the library,

I'll bring the library to him.

you even know where Handa lives?

No. I've followed him
around the area,

it's gonna freak my mom out.

meet with Kawafuji today.

running all of a sudden?!

380
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,083
[AIZAWA] Clearly, it's because
the stalker is nearby.

Actually. It's us. Isn't it?

The race is on! Let's go!

[AIZAWA] We can follow
Dash on the Dash Radar

386
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,750
and if he sticks close to Handa,
we'll find out where he lives.

Were you just trying to find
his house this whole time?

All it takes is one

to completely ruin the entire
Handa fan equilibrium.

was the stalker, though?

[HIGASHINO slobbers]

473
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,708
[HANDA]
Uh, uh...

474
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,375
[AIZAWA]
Handa. But why...?

475
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,583
He's the picture of divinity.

476
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,541
How can we possibly respond?

477
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,291
[AIZAWA]
Maybe not that divine!

478
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,125
Perhaps he's here to
grace us with his wisdom?

479
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,833
[HANDA]
What do you want?

480
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,833
How did you know
I was coming here?

481
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,333
[HANDA]
The goal is so close.

482
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,291
Kawafuji's waiting for me.

483
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,916
I'm always making him suffer

484
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,375
because I'm too much of a coward
to do anything about this.

485
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,458
Wait. What am I so afraid of?

486
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,416
They're the ones
causing me trouble.

487
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,333
I shouldn't have
to run from them!

488
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,750
They're just bullies!

489
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,166
[KONDO]
Weirdo.

490
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,541
[AIZAWA] Why are you standing
on a wall, you moron?

491
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,333
[TSUTSUI]
I wanna punch him.

492
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,250
[REO]
He's so lame.

493
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,000
[MIYOKO]
I dropped my contact.

494
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:11,708
[KASUMI]
Me too.

495
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,083
[HIGASHINO retches]

496
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,875
[HANDA] You're selfish.
And you're cruel.

497
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,333
And I'm not taking this anymore!

498
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,250
[HANDA]
I've had enough of you!

499
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:24,083
What the hell are you even
thinking? Stop following me!

500
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,833
What did I do to deserve
this, huh?! What?!

501
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,416
We've done it now.

502
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,583
[HANDA] You're going to ruin
the only friendship I've got!

503
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,291
Go away! Don't ever
come near me again!

504
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,041
Got it?

505
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,541
[REO, AIZAWA]
Handa!

506
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,833
[footsteps]

507
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,875
[KONDO]
He's never said his feelings

508
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,916
straight to our faces
like that before.

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,791
I guess this is a good thing?

510
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,291
That was intense.

511
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,916
He's really angry, isn't he?

512
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,625
[KONDO] I wonder what
everyone's thinking right now.

513
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,958
Are they finally aware

514
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,000
of how much trouble
they've been causing him?

515
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,916
It's pretty clear, isn't it?

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,666
[AIZAWA laughing]

517
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,000
What's so funny?

518
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,875
Did you hear that, stalker?!

519
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,041
We know you're here,
you little cockroach!

520
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,791
That was a declaration of war
straight from Handa's mouth!

521
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,000
You can run, but you can't hide!

522
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,416
[KONDO]
Aizawa, would you listen?

523
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,875
[TSUTSUI] What an honor!
What at honor to hear his words!

524
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,166
He said that he doesn't
want the stalker

525
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,916
to ruin our friendship!

526
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,333
You just hear what you want to.

527
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,083
We will never leave his side!

528
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,208
If you dare to oppose
Handa, you stalker,

529
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,416
you will face our wrath!

530
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,083
Not to mention, my wrath!

531
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,083
I'm wrathful!

532
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,583
[AIZAWA]
Mm!

533
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,583
Until the day that Handa can
go home in peace, we fight!

534
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,875
Uh. Guys? No...

535
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,041
[REO] What are you doing, Yuki?
C'mon get your butt over here!

536
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,166
[KONDO]
Ugh, fine.

537
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,333
[ALL] Ready? Handa's
Handa Force... Go!

538
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,875
[KONDO]
I'm sorry, Handa.

539
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,583
They're never gonna get it.
You're doomed.

540
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,541
[bell jingles]

541
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,583
[HANDA]
Sorry I kept you waiting!

542
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,708
There were a bunch of jerks
from school following me today.

543
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,375
[KAWAFUJI]
You're gonna have to run faster!

544
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,708
[HANDA]
Why are you covered in dirt?

545
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:03,875
Oh, yeah.

546
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,583
I was playing with a
dog on the way here

547
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,958
and I didn't have
time to clean up.

548
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,500
Seems like a lot of dogs
around these days.

549
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,250
Oh, but listen,

550
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,583
I finally told off those jerks
that have been stalking me!

551
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,291
[KAWAFUJI] Really? We'll
see how that works out.

552
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,916
[HANDA]
Huh? What does that mean?

553
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,500
[HANDA] Have you ever
had alcohol before?

554
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,833
Not yet.

555
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,625
But I'll be throwin' back
champagne and tequila,

556
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:59,041
all that stuff, just as
soon as I'm old enough!

557
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:00,916
[KAWAFUJI]
Why yes...

558
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,541
[HANDA]
Man, Kawafuji's so cool.

559
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,291
[HANDA, KAWAFUJI]
Cheers!

560
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,333
Here's to you, pal,
happy birthday!

561
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,958
Hell yeah! I can finally
get my booze on!

562
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,583
Uh-oh. Um... Hello?

563
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,958
[KAWAFUJI]
Next time, this stuff! [laughs]
