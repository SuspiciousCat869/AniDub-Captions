2
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,083
[HANADA] Sei Handa is the
object of my admiration.

3
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,833
Or rather, he was.

4
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:51,666
To admire someone is to yearn
for them, to look up to them.

5
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,000
That implies that they are
something greater than you,

6
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:58,458
that the two of you will
never become one.

7
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,291
[HANDA]
Must be my imagination.

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,875
[HANADA]
But that won't do at all.

9
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't spend my whole life
yearning for Sei Handa.

10
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,041
No, I was born to be Sei Handa.

11
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:13,666
And now, I will make
that dream a reality!

12
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,500
[HARU]
Ta-da!

13
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,291
Is this super cool or what?

14
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,875
A Handa original?

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,000
He set up a spot
in Oohirogi Park

16
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,958
and was selling these
to anyone who came by.

17
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,333
I heard he was working as a
street artist after school,

18
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,708
but I didn't believe it.

19
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,208
We should go check
it out today!

20
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:27,750
[IKEUCHI]
Mm!

21
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,000
Sounds great!

22
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,833
[HANDA] So, evidently
I'm a street poet now?

23
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,875
I don't remember writing
anything like that.

24
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,125
Or any poetry actually, ever.

25
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,500
[HARU] We should make it
the official class slogan!

26
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,708
[HIROE]
Yeah!

27
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,458
[HANDA] Are they doing
this to torment me?

28
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,208
That poetry sucks!
Don't put my name on it!

29
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,500
You think it's legit?

30
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,250
I don't know if Handa
writes poetry or not.

31
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,000
[KONDO]
Stop standing next to me.

32
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,541
We're not friends.

33
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,250
According to my observations,

34
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,625
Handa always makes an
effort not to stand out.

35
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,208
He goes straight
home after class

36
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,750
and works on his calligraphy.

37
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,958
I think.

38
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,125
Though he does buy art
supplies sometimes.

39
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,375
I think.

40
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,291
He doesn't have the time
to sit around some park

41
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,500
selling poems and stuff.

42
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,333
I think.

43
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,583
Wow. You know Handa so well.

44
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,958
[ALL]
Because I've been stalking him.

45
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,333
Anyway...

46
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,916
Whatever is happening,
Handa's likely not involved.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,458
But we should go check
it out just to be sure.

and never worked up
the courage to complain.

53
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,416
It pisses me off knowing
some moron's out there

54

putting my name on this garbage.

55
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,250
And it pisses me off even more
seeing people post that garbage

56
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,083

Are you trying to tell me
you punch your pizza?

Whoa, you all right?

Uh. That hurt.

[TSUTSUI] So it was a Handa
imposter! Of course.

80
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,666
You were using
Handa's popularity

to make money off
your crappy poetry.

phony, chasing chump change?

Which you have to admit,
sounds a lot like Sei Handa,

91
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,166
which is what I thought when
I saw him at the high school

92
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,333
entrance ceremony and I
realized how awesome he was!

93
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,625
Now please don't cut my hair,

94
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,000
it takes me two hours
to get it right!

95
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,625
So, you're not in
it for the money,

96
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,291
you're just an overly
enthusiastic Handa cosplayer

to draw the line.

More or less.

At first I just admired
Handa like anyone else,

started thinking I was him!

You're not a fan,
you're completely insane.

this could happen to us.

I'm sorry!

468
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,208
[HANDA]
Well, that didn't work.

469
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,583
[BOY STUDENT 4E]
C'mon, Tsutsui!

470
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,791
The punks at Kuro High

471
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,375
are beating us up
and taking our money!

472
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
[BOY STUDENT 4F]
Help us!

473
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,291
I already told you, I'm not
fighting thugs anymore.

474
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,708
[HANDA]
It's that big, angry guy.

475
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,875
I only use these fists if
the right person asks me.

476
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,708
[HANDA]
He's kind of scary.

477
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,958
But I did okay the last
time I talked to him.

478
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,041
[TSUTSUI]
Maybe I should fight those guys.

479
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,500
Uh?

480
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,333
[TSUTSUI]
Uh...

481
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,166
[HANDA] All I have to do is say,
"The weather's nice today.

482
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,375
How 'bout you open
the window?" Easy.

483
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,875
[TSUTSUI]
Did I piss him off, maybe?

484
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,416
No,

485
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,916
this is the face of a man with
something important to say.

486
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,625
You want me to take out those
punks from Kuro High, don't you?

487
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,750
I, uh--

488
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,291
[TSUTSUI]
Whatever it is, I'll do it!

489
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,416
I'll give my life for you,
if that's what it takes.

490
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,750
Nice weather today, huh?

491
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,708
Yeah. Perfect weather
for a brawl, right?

492
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,625
[HANDA whimpers] That's what
this guy does on a nice day?

493
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,500
Well, I've come this far.
I can't back down now.

494
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,166
[clears throat] The window.

495
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,333
[TSUTSUI] Does he want me
to... Open the window?

496
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,708
No, the window is a metaphor!

497
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,541
A wall that I must break through
with the strength of my resolve!

498
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,083
[TSUTSUI] I ain't afraid of
nothing, not even expulsion!

499
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,250
Watch this!

500
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,750
[REO] What the hell
are you doing, man?!

501
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,250
[HANDA] This has been
a complete disaster.

502
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,958
How does everyone else do it?

503
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,416
I can't figure out how these
people think at all.

504
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,166
There has to be
something, anything,

505
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,875
we have in common to talk about.

506
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,333
Huh? Why is there nobody here?

507
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,375
[HANDA] Modern literature's
supposed to be next, right?

508
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,875
Was there a schedule change
and nobody told me?

509
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:48,541
[HANDA]
Uh?

510
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,791
[KONDO]
Uh.

511
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,875
[KONDO]
Handa. This is awkward.

512
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,416
[HANDA]
Lucky me!

513
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,125
[KONDO] What, did he not notice
when the entire class left?

514
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
[KONDO]
He's following me, isn't he?

515
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,375
[HANDA] He saved me!
How can I ever repay him?

516
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,625
Well, the least I can do
is start up a conversation.

517
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,875
Okay, think. What do
we have in common?

518
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:09,583
[HANDA]
Japan.

519
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,375
[KONDO]
Uh? Wha...?

520
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,166
Japan is a nice place to live.

521
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,333
[KONDO]
Huh?

522
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,125
Is that... supposed
to be a question...?

523
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,500
I mean. I guess?

524
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,708
[HANDA]
It was too general!

525
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,000
Too vague! I knew it!

526
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,250
[HANDAS chattering]

527
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,291
[HANDA]
It'd be weird enough

528
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,541
if a friend said
something like that,

529
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,583
but I don't even know
this guy's name!

530
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,208
It is nice, huh?

531
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,333
[gasps]

532
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,083
I mean, I've never
been abroad before,

533
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,666
so I wouldn't really know.

534
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,583
[gasps]

535
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,250
Yep, that's what I thought.

536
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,750
Japan really is a
wonderful place.

537
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,666
[HANDA]
Ha! I knew I could do it!

538
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,375
Uh... I think I understand
Handa even less now.

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,625
[HANDA] Try not to be
shocked by this, Mom.

540
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,166
[HANDA'S MOM]
What is it, Sei?

541
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,083
[HANDA] Today, I talked
with one of my classmates!

542
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
Oh, good for you.

543
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Now, be careful,
the soup is hot.

544
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,833
I found something we
both had in common

545
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,541
and he replied back to me
and everything! [laughs]

546
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, that's nice.

547
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,250
[KAWAFUJI]
After seeing his mother's

548
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,916
overwhelming lack of interest,

549
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,916
Handa realized that his
hard-fought triumph

550
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,250
really wasn't anything
special at all.

551
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,958
This one is a little more
blunt than I'm used to.

552
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,000
Usually, it's like...

553
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,416
Or maybe this...

554
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,333
Or like this even...

555
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,583
[KAWAFUJI]
Next time,

556
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,750
"Handa- <i>kun</i> and the
Student Council."

557
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,708
"Handa- <i>kun</i> and Memory Loss."

558
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,916
You're gonna love it.
