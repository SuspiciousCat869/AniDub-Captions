00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,625
[KAWAFUJI]
Recently, what little trust

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,041
Handa had in others
really took a hit.

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,333
Is someone there? No. Wait! No.

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,833
[KAWAFUJI]
But I can understand why,

5
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,708
considering how rough
his classmates were

6
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,541
when they tried to get
his memories back.

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,208
If this keeps up, he's
gonna have a meltdown.

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,000
[KAWAFUJI]
Hm.

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,708
[HANDA]
Ahh! Phew.

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,708
For a second I thought
you were gonna hit me.

11
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,458
[KAWAFUJI]
I gotta help him through this.

12
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,916
Without ruining my fun, that is.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,375
You wanna... hang out later?

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,958
[HANDA]
Huh?

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,750
[KAWAFUJI sighs]

16
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,250
[HANDA]
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

17
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,000
You're late.

18
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,125
[HANDA]
I said sorry.

19
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,541
Is that you?

20
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,958
Yeah.

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,000
I thought changing my appearance
would be a good idea.

22
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,458
[KAWAFUJI]
No uniform for once?

23
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,000
It's in my bag.

24
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,208
But by donning this outfit,
I can live life to the fullest!

25
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,958
Reign it in, carrot top.

26
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,791
We can't leave just yet.

27
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,833
[HASEGAWA]
Kawa!

28
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,958
[BOTH]
Uh?

29
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,083
[HASEGAWA]
Hey! Thanks for inviting me.

30
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,333
This should be a lot of fun!

31
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,041
Yeah, this'll be a good time.

32
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,291
[HANDA]
Okay, stay calm.

33
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,958
After all, Kawafuji never said

34
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,750
that it was only
going to be us today.

35
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,458
This runt here is Hasegawa.

36
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,833
Despite being on the basketball
team, he's a total goober.

37
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,791
Don't make fun of me!

38
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,291
Fine. This is my pal Han--

39
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,250
I'm Hanzawa. Nice meeting you.

40
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,416
[HASEGAWA]
Yeah...

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,250
[HANDA] I've gotta protect
Kawafuji's name.

42
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,375
I'm guessing you know each
other from grade school?

43
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,166
Uh...

44
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,666
No, I uh, studied abroad!

45
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,041
Whoa! So does that mean you
can speak another language?

46
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,000
[HANDA] Uh! Iyay usway
orcedfay ootay ealizeray

owhey ownlylay Iyay amyay.

48
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,041
Cool! Of course, I have
no idea what you just said.

49
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,125
[KAWAFUJI]  Thanks, Handa,
for always being entertaining.

50
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,458
[HASEGAWA]
Come on, let's go!

51
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,041
So, uh. Sorry.

52
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,750
But I don't think I can do this.

53
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,458
You can, you just need
to unclench first.

54
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,791
He's a really nice guy.

55
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,291
That's why you're here.

56
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,541
I wanted you to make
another friend, see?

57
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,041
Kawafuji.

58
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,291
How can you be so kind to me?

59
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
[HASEGAWA] There they are,
the Triple Apple Straps!

60
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,416
Aren't they adorable?

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,416
This is the last
day to get them.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,791
It takes three
games to win them,

63
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,125
but I'm only good at one.

64
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,250
That's where you guys come in.

65
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,125
[HANDA]
Uh?!

66
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,375
Got it. You can count on us.

67
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,458
Are you ready?

68
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,375
[HANDA]
Darts, basketball, and bowling.

69
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,916
I've never played
any of those before.

70
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,791
[HASEGAWA]
Let's start with bowling.

71
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,541
To win Nana, we need to throw
12 strikes for a perfect game.

72
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,916
That's a pretty challenging
task for a lousy strap.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,125
Well, it just goes to show ya

74
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,416
how much they're
actually worth.

75
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,541
Have you found yourself
a ball yet?

76
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,041
I did. But it's stuck.

77
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,625
Yeah, 'cause it's a kids ball!

78
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,166
[laughs] This guy's hysterical!

79
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,958
Man. If that hand's hurt,
your career is over with.

80
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,333
You must have learned
comedy like that overseas.

81
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,166
Use mine.

82
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,500
Uh. Thanks.

83
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,500
[KAWAFUJI]
Yeah, he wishes it was joke.

84
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,833
He's probably never even
seen a bowling ball.

85
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,333
[HANDA yelping]

86
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,000
[KAWAFUJI laughs]

87
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,500
[HASEGAWA]
Hanzawa!

88
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,916
Let me guess, you've never
gone bowling before, have you?

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,833
It's been... a while.

90
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,583
[HASEGAWA] Well, for starters,
your form isn't right.

91
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,250
Swing your arm
like this. Got it?

92
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,250
[HANDA]
Uh. Yeah.

93
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,250
Now go for it!

94
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,375
--[KAWAFUJI laughing]
--[HASEGAWA] Whoa, Hanzawa!

95
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,958
[HANDA groaning]

96
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,166
All right, boys,

97
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,750
step back and watch
how a real man plays.

98
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,083
You even have your own brace!

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,166
Strike!

100
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,000
[HASEGAWA] Now that's
the way to do it, Kawa!

101
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,708
[HANDA] Wow, Kawafuji is
really good at everything.

102
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,083
Unlike me.

103
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,583
[HASEGAWA]
Thank you so much.

104
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,666
I'd have never gotten
her on my own.

105
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,291
It wasn't that big of a deal.

106
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,708
[HASEGAWA]
Next up: darts.

107
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,000
This one is where we get Foo

108
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,875
by hitting three
bullseyes in a row.

109
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,625
Another doozy of a challenge.

110
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,416
[HANDA]
I have to redeem myself!

111
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,250
You do know how to play
this one, right?

112
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,166
Uh. Yeah. Sure.

113
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
Well, I sure am glad
you're here, then.

114
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,500
Personally, I kind of
suck at darts, heh.

115
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,791
[HANDA]
Huh?

116
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,375
[grunts] Sorry.

117
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,666
My arm's kinda worn out from
bowling all those strikes.

118
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,833
Oh, no! It's up to you, Hanzawa!

119
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:59,958
[HANDA] Focus, focus, focus,
focus, focus, focus, focus...

120
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,375
[KAWAFUJI]
Don't overexert yourself.

121
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,041
[HANDA]
Focus!

122
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,166
[music plays]

123
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,041
[KAWAFUJI]
Whoa!

124
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,083
[HASEGAWA]
Yes!

125
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,625
[HANDA]
Hey, guys? I think I hurt...

126
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,208
...my arm.

127
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,416
Are you serious?!

128
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,583
There's that trademark
humor again!

129
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,375
Anyway, thanks Hanzawa,
couldn't've done it without you!

130
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,208
[KAWAFUJI] It's not broken,
so you probably just

131
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,833
pulled a muscle you
don't normally use.

132
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,708
[KAWAFUJI]
Out with it.

133
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,166
I know what you're going to say.

134
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,916
I've never played basketball.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
Huh?! Is that a joke?

136
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,708
Basketball's super trendy!

137
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,166
Every kid plays it when
they're growing up in PE

138
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,250
and during recess!

139
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,833
[HANDA]
Is it really that big of a deal?

140
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,875
[KAWAFUJI] Only Handa could
live a life so sheltered.

141
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,125
[HASEGAWA] You know, with
the focus you showed earlier,

142
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,916
I bet you would have made an
awesome three-point shooter.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Kind of a waste!

144
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,500
Sorry.

145
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,583
Hey, don't be, I was
just surprised.

146
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,625
You know, you should've told me
that you had such a cool friend,

147
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,458
Kawa, we could've
hung out sooner!

148
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,833
[gasps]

149
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,916
[HANDA]
I don't believe it!

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Cool! He said I was cool!

151
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,791
He is a nice guy!

152
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,375
[grunts] Swish!

153
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh! Nothin' but net!

154
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,083
[HANDA]
There may be a chance

155
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,958
he'll become my
friend after all!

156
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:08,833
Come on!

157
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,041
Uh?

158
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,041
[HASEGAWA] Oh. They're so cute
when they're all together!

159
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,833

It was taken by Handa's
dirty schemes!

318
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,125
And I won't let him
get away with that!

319
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,958
Today, I'm going to challenge
Handa to a 100-meter race

320
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,625
and beat him fair and square!

321
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,125
[HIGASHINO yelps]
He saw me!

322
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,500
Why does he look so pissed off?

323
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,666
Forgive me! I'll never follow
you again! [whimpers]

324
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,541
[HANDA]
I forgot my notes in my desk.

325
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,458
[HIGASHINO] The trauma I endured
runs deeper than I imagined.

326
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,791
Pathetic.

327
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,666
I was so terrified,
I couldn't even talk to him.

328
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,375
[HIGASHINO gasps]
Han--

329
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,083
Wow, your obsession with Handa
must be bad if you're crying.

330
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,250
[HIGASHINO]
Are you stupid?

331
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,958
I'm not obsessed with that tool!

332
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,125
I just haven't found the right
moment to ask Handa to race me,

333
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,541
that's all!

334
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,250
I dunno, is that something
a normal person would do?

335
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,750
All I want to do is take
him down to the track!

336
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,416
But every time he looks
at me with those eyes,

337
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,250
my heart starts beating so fast,
I think it's gonna burst.

338
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,541
And I can't stop crying.

339
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,833
That's a severe case
of Handa Disease!

340
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,000
I thought only girls
got it that bad!

341
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,541
Fortunately, I can help you
deal with your symptoms.

342
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,458
If you race me in a
hundred meter dash,

343
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,916
I bet it'll be just like
racing the real Handa.

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
Yeah? How?

345
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,333
Because if everyone
wants Handa,

346
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,916
then there needs to
be more than one.

347
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,583
Okay, on your mark.

[HANADA]
Higashino.

You're way too fast!

357
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,500
That was my best
time to date!

358
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,041
[HANADA] So what's the secret
to reaching that kind of speed?

359
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,541
[HIGASHINO]
Easy!

360
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,666
You just gotta run as
if your greatest fear

361
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,166
is nipping at your heels!

362
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,750
That's smart, if not... weird.

363
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,375
So...

364
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,666
If you can't work up the courage
to challenge Handa to a race,

365
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,333
why not create a situation
where he has to run?

366

I'm listening.

367
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
[HIGASHINO] Are you sure
this is gonna make Handa

368
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,000
take off running?

369
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,500
[HANADA]
I mean, it should.

370
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,458
It's just gotta scare him enough
to get him moving, right?

371
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,458

I heard the principal
tore you a new one

for starting a fire today.

Don't you think it's about time

feud with Handa?

At this rate, you're
going to ruin your life!

I mean, you've never acted
out like this before now.

Running is the only
thing you're good at,

and you're throwing away your
future all because of one guy.

[HIGASHINO]
Now that I think about it,

393
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,291
the only thing I've really
managed to hone these

394

past two years in the
Track and Field club

395
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,291
was my ability to stalk
people undetected.

396
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,958
Could it be that I've
been veering off track?

This is it!

I'm gonna beat Handa
no matter what!

It all comes down to this!

The feeling that your greatest
fear is nipping at your heels.

That Fake Handa made me
remember what that was like.

so he could get
away from the dog.

I've always had a tendency

was right up my alley.

I had a reputation

throughout the school for giving
highly accurate readings.

00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,500
[TSUTSUI] That isn't exactly
something you can just do.

473
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,791
And seeing as Handa doesn't
believe in that stuff,

474
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:48,500
you're out of luck.

475
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,583
Don't feel bad.

476
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,958
If you'd like to hold hands,

477
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,500
you can always test out
your skills on yours truly.

478
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,625
You're fickle, stupid,
flashy, shallow,

479
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,875
and can't read a person's
mood to save your life.

480
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:58,875
Oh, wow.

481
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,333
You didn't even need my palm.

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,625
[HANDA] What did this
week's fortune say?

483
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,583
[gasps]

484
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,083
[HANDA
"Too bad.

485
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,708
It looks like you'll be in shock
from something unexpected.

486
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,500
You can bring luck to your side
by being helpful to others."

487
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,916
It's amazing how things
like this can bother you,

488
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,625
even when you don't
believe in it.

489
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,833
[REO]
So.

490
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,666
Why do you want to read
Handa's palm so bad?

491
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,625
[HANDA] Wait a minute.
They're talking about me?

492
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,625
A fortuneteller's credibility
is based on statistics,

493
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,625
so I need to read
a lot of people.

494
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,000
Diversity helps with that,
so I need to read the palms

495
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,291
of super popular and super
unpopular people too!

496
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,875
[HANDA]
Now I get it.

[ALL gasping]

500
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,583
[HANDA] Well. I guess if letting
her see my hand helps her,

501
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,625
there's really no reason not to.

502
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,000
Right?

503
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,583
[KONDO]
That's a weird way to sleep.

504
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,416
[REO] Do you think he overheard
us talking about him?

505
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,166
That could explain why he's
holding his hand out like that.

506
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,708
[HANDA]
What's taking so long?

507
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,083
I feel like an idiot!

508
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,458
[TSUGUMI]
Okay. Let's do this.

509
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,833
No, that can't be right!

510
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,208
It sounds like you found
something juicy!

511
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,125
[TSUGUMI]
But... Why?

512
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,500
How can his palm be so plain?

513
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,416
I thought he'd have
the Simian Line.

514
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,333
And the line showing
popularity is so weak!

515
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,583
She's writing so much!

516
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,833
This cannot be good!

517
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,041
What a professional--
she's not even nervous!

518
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,166
I wonder what she sees!

519
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,166
[TSUGUMI]
That said.

520
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,000
There's something
I can't ignore.

521
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,666
As shocking as it is,

522
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,208
his hand clearly states that
he suffers from paranoia!

523
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,458
How is it?

524
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,541
I bet you've never seen
lines like that before!

525
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,541
[TSUGUMI]
What now?

526
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,583
I didn't expect it
to be so boring.

527
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,375
As a matter of fact,
it's actually kind of bad.

528
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,333
It's too disappointing,
but I have to say something!

529
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,541
Anything!

530
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,500
I know one thing.

531
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,166
Handa must endure
a very harsh fate.

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,583
[HANDA gasping]

533
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,333
No way! Are you serious?

How harsh are we talking?

I'm not sure.

Uh. I don't have
all the details.

But he may be alone forever.

He'll face impossible odds.

00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,833
Like walking in a
never-ending desert.

Man that fortune's
right on the money!

He's a loner who does
what no one else can!

542
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,750
The desert must be a
metaphor for his life!

543
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,958

hearing everything sucks for me?

know, like his future!

Okay.

Uh.

547

Palms can change, but I may be
able to see five years from now.

[TSUGUMI] Nothing on his hand
says he'll get married.

550
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,458
But he's still going to be
surrounded by children?

551
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,666
Six? Seven?

552
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,833
So many children
in so little time!

553
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,375
They must be from
different women,

very low sex drive!

[ALL]
Tell us!

558
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,833
Keep in mind, I'm self-taught
in the ways of palmistry.

559
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,375
So I could be wrong.

This is no time for
you to be modest!

Well, the truth is,

Handa is doomed to a life
of indecency, and hardship.

564
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,458
[TSUGUMI]
I was arrogant.

565
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,541
Only an amateur would
skew the results

566
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,041
of a palm reading like I did.

567
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,750
Until I can present the
reading with confidence,

568
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,458
there's no way I can be
a real fortuneteller.

569
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm sure Handa opened
himself up to me

570
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,833
so I could learn that lesson.

571
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,333
And for that, I am grateful.

Y'know, she probably
said all that stuff

because she knew you were awake.
