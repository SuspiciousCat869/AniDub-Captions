I guess the reason
you're all worked up

No! Why Handa?

I came back to school!

Damn it!

473
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,208
I never thought I'd have
to hurt you, Handa.

474
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,041
Please kill me once you
finally return to normal!

475
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,958
[HANDA] He must be jealous
of my social standing!

476
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,791
[HANDA yelping]
I don't want to die!

477
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,875
I don't want to die!

478
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,750
Wait! Where are you going?

479
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,833
[HANDA]
I'm scared.

480
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,208
Running for my life!

481
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,750
It wasn't supposed
to be like this!

482
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,500
Hey, look!

483
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,291
[AIZAWA]
There he is!

484
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,875
[HANDA]
Everyone's out to get me!

485
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,958
I thought I was popular, but...

486
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,916
it's like everyone
really hates me!

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,125
Why does my head hurt so bad?

488
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,791
I just need a second!

489
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,000
[HANDA grunts]

490
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,375
[REO] There's nowhere
left to run, Handa!

491
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,625
After everything you've done,

492
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,166
this is the least we can
do to return the favor.

493
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,833
We're only trying
to put things back

494
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,291
to the way they were before.

495
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,250
[HANDA] My head. It feels
like it's gonna split open!

496
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,958
[HANDA]
Everyone hates me.

497
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,958
Everyone hates me.
Everyone hates me.

498
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,500
Everyone hates me...

499
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,125
[HANDA]
Everyone hates me.

500
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,541
Wh-Where am I?

501
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,541
What happened?

502
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,375
[AIZAWA]
Ready?!

503
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,208
[ALL yelling]

504
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,583
[HANDA]
Well that's... not good.

505
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,750
I gotta run!

506
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,083
[HANDA groaning]

507
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,208
[REO]
Handa! No!

508
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,250
[TSUTSUI]
You alive?

509
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,791
[REO]
That was a pretty nasty fall.

510
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,875
[TSUTSUI]
Oh, cool.

511
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,000
[REO]
He's alive. I'll take it.

512
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,500
[HANDA] I wish I could say
this came as a surprise.

513
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,083
But I've always known.

514
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,916
This just confirms it.

515
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,291
Not only does the
whole school hate me,

516
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,833
they also want me dead.

517
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,541
[ALL screaming]

518
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,333
[HANDA] Nothing left to do
but laugh it off.

519
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,708
[REO]
He's walking away.

520
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,833
You think Handa got
his memory back?

521
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,083
Yeah. There's no mistaking
that look in his eye.

522
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,291
Or that smile.

523
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,208
[AIZAWA]
Because of our efforts,

524
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,333
Handa was restored
to his former self!

525
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,708
[HANADA humming]
Hey, guys!

526
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,291
Good morning!

527
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,875
I didn't think it was possible,

528
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,291
but you're more annoying
than ever, Fake Handa.

529
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,500
[laughs] That's because I
adapted my Handa Aesthetic

530
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,208
to follow his current trend.

531
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,041
Huh? Hey, Handa.
Lovely day, huh?

532
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,708
[HANADA gasping, screams]

533
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,541
[TSUTSUI] That's the Handa
we know and love!

534
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,083
[AIZAWA] He looked at him
with such loathing!

535
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,416
[REO]
It was beautiful!

536
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:19,291
[KAWAFUJI] And thus, Handa
was back to his old self.

537
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,125
[STUDENTS chattering]

538
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,791
[SAWAKO] These stairs
are far too dangerous.

539
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,500
We should put up a sign
to warn the students.

540
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:02,416
Rikimaru. Get to work on that.

541
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,708
Huh? I don't take orders
from little girls like you.

542
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,666
[SAWAKO growls]

543
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,041
Oh, yeah?

544
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,583
[RIKIMARU]
Hm?

545
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,750
[KAWAFUJI]
Next time,

546
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,833
"Handa- <i>kun</i> and his
Friend's Friend"

547
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,000
And two others.
You're gonna love it.
