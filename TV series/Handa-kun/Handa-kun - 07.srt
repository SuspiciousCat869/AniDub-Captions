[TSUTSUI] I guess as

[AIZAWA] C'mon, guys, you need
to take this seriously.

face Handa with dignity,

We should make a sign showing
that this is our secret base.

Uh. Why would a secret base
have a sign hanging up?

A better question would be:

Why does Handa have a task
force he doesn't know about?

28

So here's what we're
dealing with.

If Aizawa got the highest

00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:01,833
[TSUTSUI]
Can't be.

158
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,416
[REO] Why is Handa here?

159
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,708
[TSUTSUI] Don't tell me he needs
to take the test, too!

160
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,125
[REO]
There's no way!

161
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,250
All right.

162
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,291
If you're here for the make-up
exam, please take a seat.

163
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,083
Good luck, guys. Have fun.

164
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,458
[TSUTSUI] There's no way
Handa should have to take

165
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,500
the make-up exam.

166
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
Maybe he forgot
to sign his name.

167
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,375
No. He'd never make
a mistake like that.

168
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,583
[REO] I never thought I'd see
Handa take a make-up test.

169
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,250
Did he forget to put
his name on his midterm?

170
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,708
Nah, that's crazy talk.

171
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,833
[HIGASHINO]
Handa retaking a test?

172
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,375
I thought he was smart.

173
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,083
What, did he forget to write
his name the first time?

174
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,333
Like that would ever happen.

175
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,333
[HANADA] How in the world did
Handa get stuck in here with us?

176
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,166
It's not like he'd
do something stupid

177
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,541
when it came to writing
down his name.

178
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,125
So the question is...

179
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,791
[ALL] ...why is he taking
the make-up exam?

180
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:04,625
[HANDA sighs]
I can't believe I'm here.

181
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,833
But that's what I get for
leaving my name blank.

182
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,583
What's worse is my score
wasn't too bad, either.

183
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,375
I would have been
25th in my grade.

184
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,125
But I guess I'm dead-last when
it comes to common sense.

185
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,583
Fortunately, it doesn't sound

186
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,666
like it'll affect
my GPA or anything.

187
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,625
You make a mistake
like that on your final,

188
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,208
there's no second chance.

189
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,958
Hopefully retaking the test will
inspire you to be more diligent.

190
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,125
[HANDA sighs]
It's not a big deal,

191
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,375
but it's such a waste spending
my Sunday like this...

192
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,541
[TSUTSUI] He's actually
filling it out? Why?

193
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,208
[REO]
Why?

194
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:36,791
[HIGASHINO]
Why?

195
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,416
[HANADA]
Why?

196
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,958
[TSUTSUI]
Why?

197
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:38,625
[REO]
Why?

198
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,250
[HIGASHINO]
Why?

199
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,375
[HANADA]
Why?!

200
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,166
Hey. Keep your eyes
on your own tests!

201
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,416
[HANADA] Taking a test in
the same room as Handa

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,875
is nerve-wracking.
My heart is pounding!

203
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,208
[REO]
Come on, Reo, focus!

204
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,791
Fifteenth Shogun of
the Tokugawa Clan?

205
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,666
I swear I studied this!

206
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,541
Think... Think!

207
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,750
[REO]
Uh?

208
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,500
[STUDENTS gasp]

209
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,916
[HANDA]
Oh, man.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,958
I didn't realize how loud that'd
be in a room this quiet!

211
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,083
[REO]
It happened...

212
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,833
[TSUTSUI]
...Handa sneezed.

213
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,708
[HANADA] I never thought I'd
hear Handa do something

214
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,458
like that so clearly. This is a
once in a lifetime experience!

215
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,500
[HIGASHINO] I didn't think
Handa could sneeze.

216
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,750
[HANDA]
I bet everyone's mad at me.

217
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,291
[REO]
It makes sense.

218
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,208
I mean, Handa is human,

219
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,875
so it's only natural
that he sneezes, too.

220
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,916
[TSUTSUI]
I feel closer to him now.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,958
[HANDA sighs]
That was so embarrassing.

222
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,541
[TSUTSUI] Uh? Why's he making
that scratching noise?

223
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,250
[REO]
Maybe it's his writing utensil.

224
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,666
He struggles with
anything but a brush.

225
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,875
[HIGASHINO]
He's just going to town!

226
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,166
[TSUTSUI] Who knew he
had a habit like this?

227
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,416
I'm learning so much about him!
This day is amazing.

228
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,833
[HANADA]
All right, it's decided:

229
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,666
rend to follow!
that scratching is the latest
Handa

230
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,833
[REO]
I have to try it.

231
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,125
[TSUTSUI] I dunno if
my answers are correct.

232
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,875
But I can't stop writing!

233
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,958
And it's all because I
wanna make this noise!

234
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,541
[HIGASHINO] Ha, ha, ha! Gotta
give it to "Speedy Handa."

235
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,500
All that scratching is
getting everyone fired up!

236
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,125
[REO] The classroom has
become our battlefield.

237
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,500
And each one of us is
fighting with Handa!

238
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:49,250
[OKAYAMA chuckles nervously]
It sure is noisy in here today.

239
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,291
[bell rings]

240
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,791
[OKAYAMA]
Okay, pencils down.

241
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,125
Turn your papers over
and pass them up to me.

242
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,166
[AIZAWA]
Well, how did it go?

243
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,166
[REO]
Ah...

244
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,666
It was really awesome!

245
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,416
It was a battle, but Handa
lead us without fear!

246
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,958
That's the first time
I've ever written

247
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,416
without second-guessing myself!

248
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,125
He "lead" you? How so?

249
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,791
[REO] We actually got
passing scores! [cries]

250
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,541
And it's all because of your
expert tutoring, Aizawa!

251
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,333
What are you guys saying?

252
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,250
It's because of
all your hard work!

253
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,583
Yeah, way to go.

254
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,291
That said, the one who
drew the best out of you,

255
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,541
was none other than
Handa himself.

256
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,833
Yeah.

257
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,875
You're right.

258
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,250
Wait, but how?

259
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
I was wrong about him all along.

260
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,166
I thought he didn't take first
to prioritize his work.

261
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,875
But he's too much of a man
to do something like that.

262
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,166
He did it for us.

263
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,875
He put his grades at
risk to help us pass.

264
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,416
To serve as a shining
light in our darkness.

265
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,958
In the beginning,

266
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,250
we set out with the intention
of preserving Handa's image.

267
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,375
We didn't want him to have
to bear our shame,

268
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,916
but he did so
willingly on his own.

269
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,916
He really is an
inspiration to us all.

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah.

271
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,083
Handa... We owe you.

272
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,708
[HANDA grunts]

273
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,250
[KONDO] Just another day
in the life, I guess.

274
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,875
Where Handa earns respect
without doing anything.

275
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,166
[KONDO] Meanwhile... Dash and
the imposter's tests...

276
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,750
[KASUMI]
My name is Kasumi Hirayama.

277
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,208
During lunch and after school,

278
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,625
I work in the library lending
books to my classmates.

279
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,208
Or that's what I'm
supposed to do,

280
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,375
but kids my age don't read much.

281
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,833
So the library's
pretty desolate.

282
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,833
[KASUMI] And because of that,
the budget was cut,

283
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,875
preventing me from
buying new books.

284
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,125
Which makes the place
almost purposeless.

285
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,375
Despite that, though.

286
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,916
There's something
that keeps me going

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,541
no matter how bleak things get.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,291
[KASUMI]
He's here!

289
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,083
My charming prince who
occasionally borrows books.

290
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,750
Handa! [giggles]

291
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,416
[KASUMI]
He's always so dreamy...

292
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,875
[KASUMI]
I can't help but wonder,

293
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,708
'What kind of girl
does Handa think I am?'

294
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,583
If I had to guess, I'd say
'just quiet and boring.'

295
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:33,208
After all, I'm too shy
to make an impression.

296
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,041
[HANDA]
Hm?

297
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,791
[HANDA]
Someone's there!

298
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,083
[KASUMI] But still...
I want him to notice me.

299
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,375
Especially because,
when I do receive funds,

300
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,250
I spend what little I'm
given on books he'll like.

301
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,416
[gasps]

302
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,291
[HANDA] I haven't seen
this title before.

303
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,250
[KASUMI]
Heh. My gift to you.

304
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,208
[HANDA]
This is a really niche genre.

305
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,208
I'm probably the only
person who'd read it.

306
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,458
I'll put it back so
I'm not seen with it.

307
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,750
[KASUMI] Some of those
publications were out of print.

308
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,916
So they cost a fortune.

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,625
But the question is,

310
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,500
how long will it
take him to notice

311
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,250
that there's also
a romance novel

312
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,958
amid the books sitting on the
shelf in the "Handa Corner"?

313
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,666
And what a coincidence.

314
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,083
It's a love story about
the coolest kid in school

315
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,375
falling for the dull librarian.

316
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,041
Kiss. Kiss, kiss, kiss!

317
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,500
[HANDA groans]

318
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,500
[HANDA gasping]

319
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,875
[KASUMI] As I expected,
he didn't even bat an eye

320
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,458
at the romance novel.

321
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,666
Which is exactly why I
switched its dust jacket

322
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,625
with one from a calligraphy
book to trick him

323
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,375
into borrowing the story
of our future lives!

324
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,500
Please. Read the novel
despite my deception.

325
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,041
Then take notice of your
dull heroine in wait.

326
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,291
[sighs]

327
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,541
[gasping]

328
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,000
[REO] Man, we haven't
found Handa anywhere!

329
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,708
[AIZAWA]
Huh. I thought for sure...

330
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,291
[KASUMI] Usually, no one bothers
coming to the library.

331
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,625
But every so often, Handa's
fanboys barge in like this.

332
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,416
They follow him around like
they're special or something.

333
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,833
I hate it.

334
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,291
[TSUTSUI] There's nothing
but musty old books here.

335
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,708
[gasps]

336
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,625
Watch it!

337
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,125
Whoa! Where did you come from?

338
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,458
[KASUMI]
I've been here the whole time!

339
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,875
The Handa Cor-- I mean,
the books in the library

340
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,541
deserve your respect, got it?

341
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,708
We're sorry.

342
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,541
Please calm down.
It was only an accident.

343
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,291
For real.

344
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,541
[KASUMI]
Honestly...

345
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,791
You guys could learn a
thing or two from Handa.

346
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,041
Did you special order all
of this section's books?

347
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,166
Maybe! What's it matter
to you anyway?

348
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,375
It's not like it came
out of your budget!

349
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,916
Well,

350
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,791
I just think it's pretty obvious
they were ordered for Handa.

351
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,375
You're crazy!

352
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,916
I know Handa's caught a lot of
girls' eyes, but that's not me!

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,041
Unlike them, I'm doing
this out of true love!

354
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,708
I think they'd say
the same thing.

355
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,708
Look, I am not just another
ordinary suitor, okay?

356
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,375
Destiny is pulling Handa
and me toward each other.

357
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,291
Soon, love and
romance will blossom

358
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,916
like in a classic fairy tale.

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,458
Though neither of
us can see it yet,

360
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,833
the red string of fate has tied
our little fingers together!

361
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,958
If you say so, but just
gathering old books won't do it.

362
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:06,958
Huh?

363
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,333
[REO]
Handa's a fashion leader.

364
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,833
Which means he needs
fashion magazines.

365
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,333
And besides, a library without
magazines is so last year.

366
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,208
[KASUMI]
Uh...

367
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,166
Don't forget, Handa's a fighter.

368
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,125
You should get books
on martial arts.

369
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,583
Some fantasy novels, too!

370
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,833
Whoa, whoa!

371
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,875
You guys need to back
off with the demands!

372
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,250
Hey, while we're
improving the selection,

373
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,291
we should try to spruce up
this drab place as well!

374
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,291
There's an idea!

375
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,666
Heck yeah!

376
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,791
[KASUMI] What exactly do you
think is happening here?

377
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,625
You guys have no
authority over this!

378
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,666
A school librarian
has to select books

379
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,916
that all of the
students will enjoy,

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,166
we can't just make decisions

381
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,875
based on our own
personal feelings!

382
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,833
[REO] Seems like one student
enjoys romance novels too much.

383
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,083
[KASUMI]
Stop making fun of me!

384
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,500
It's not like I'm
pining for him!

385
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,833
If you're an expert
when it comes to books,

386
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,083
then we're the experts
when it comes to Handa.

387
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,958
So if you wanna
get his attention,

388
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,750
your best bet is letting
us fix up this library.

389
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,500
[sighs]

390
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,833
[KASUMI]
I hate to admit it,

391
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,583
but they are closer
to him than I am.

392
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,375
Start with our class.

393
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,583
Yeah, that's a good call.

394
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,416
[KASUMI]
It's not my favorite plan.

395
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,125
But if they can
turn this library

396
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,875
into a place Handa can really
love, then I'm all for it.

397
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,958
[KAWAFUJI] And so, the Handa
Force was on the case.

398
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,250
The mission was simple:

399
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,541
collect as many genres
of books as they could.

400
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,750
[REO]
Ta-da!

401
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,625
[KASUMI gasping]
Look at all of them!

402
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,375
But my budget's so small,
how could you afford this?

403
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,875
We didn't have to.

404
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,958
We just asked our classmates
to donate their used books.

405
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,500
[KASUMI]
I can't believe this is real!

406
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,666
There's so many!

407
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,750
Everyone was more than
happy to help out.

408
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,041
Especially once we told them
that it was for Handa.

409
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,208
[KASUMI]
Do you think this means

410
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,500
he'll come to the library
even more often?

411
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,166
[AIZAWA]
Oh, it won't just be him.

412
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,625
Uh?

413
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,500
[STUDENTS]
Wow!

414
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,541
Everybody wanted to come
and check this place out

415
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,291
after they heard about
its new additions!

416
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,416
[KASUMI]
There are so many people!

417
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,125
How do I check this out?

418
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,583
I have to read
this whole series.

419
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,458
[gasping]

420
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,458
Go on! They're all
waiting for you!

421
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,208
Wait, I can't do all
this by myself.

422
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,708
I'm going to need some help!

423
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,583
[KASUMI]
Please form a line!

424
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,125
[gasping]

425
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,500
[KASUMI]
One at a time!

426
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,541
[HANDA] Man, there're a lot
of students here today.

427
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,083
This book isn't due yet.

428
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,375
I guess I'll come back
once it's settled down.

429
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,125
[KASUMI] The library has
been very busy since then.

430
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,166
It's hard to believe
the place was ever quiet

431
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,208
with how many students come
in to borrow books these days.

432
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:37,083
Now my days as a librarian are
constantly filled with work.

433
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,583
Ugh, stupid hair...

434
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,166
[KASUMI]
I've always enjoyed reading,

435
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,958
so it's a satisfying feeling.

436
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,875
And it's not that I'm
not happy, but... still.

437
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,958
[STUDENTS chattering]

438
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,916
[KASUMI sighs]

439
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,875
[AIZAWA]
Another successful day.

440
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,208
Thanks to you.

441
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,083
I didn't even know it
could be like this before.

442
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,041
Well, it gets better 'cause
the Student Council's

443
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,833
upping your funds!

444
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,916
Wow, really?

445
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,875
That means I can order
even more books!

446
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,666
[laughs] Now you're starting to
sound like a real librarian!

447
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,000
[KASUMI]
Hm!

448
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,875
[AIZAWA] It looks like
Handa's done it yet again.

449
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,125
Huh?

450
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,791
[AIZAWA] I'm sure he's
always wanted this place

451
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,833
to be busy and thriving
like it is now.

452
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,083
Maybe...

453
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,541
[AIZAWA]
Huh?

454
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,666
[STUDENTS chattering]

455
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,125
[KASUMI]
I'd like to think that's true,

456
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,083
but Handa hasn't come back
since it became so active.

457
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,125
[KASUMI] There! That should
do it for me today.

458
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:32,458
[gasps] Handa! He came back...
to return that book.

459
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,250
So, uh...

460
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,791
Uh! Uh, yes?

461
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,875
[KASUMI] Ah! This is the first
time he's ever spoken to me!

462
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,416
What's he gonna say?

463
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Is he going to praise me for all
the work I've done? Omigosh!

464
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,041
[HANDA]
You've done very well.

465
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,833
[KASUMI] I'd give anything to
have him pat me on the head!

466
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,500
It would be like
a dream come true!

467
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,791
[HANDA]
So, the thing is...

468
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:50,958
[KASUMI]
This is it!

469
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,375
[HANDA]
This book I borrowed last time

470
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,666
has the wrong cover on it.

471
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,958
Uh? Uhh...

472
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,250
[KASUMI]
Oh yeah.

473
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,125
I completely forgot about
my brilliant setup.

474
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,333
Did you read it at all?

475
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,250
I mean...

476
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,791
[KASUMI]
Crap!

477
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,583
I got caught up in the moment
but do I even want to know?

478
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,083
I did a little bit.

479
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,666
Yeah?! What'd you think?

480
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,791
[KASUMI] Now I'm asking for
his opinion? I'm so bold!

481
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,541
[KASUMI gasping]

482
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,541
[HANDA]
Uhh...

483
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,250
I was quite profoundly touched

484
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,625
by the librarian's
pride in her work.

485
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,541
[KASUMI gasps]

486
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,083
[KASUMI]
I knew it.

487
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,375
[KASUMI]
Handa really did

488
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,583
recognize my hard
work all along.

489
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,375
But I hadn't been doing it
for the right reasons.

490
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,708
[KASUMI] I won't order books
on calligraphy ever again.

491
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,250
Huh?

492
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,875
Instead, I'll be
asking for things

493
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,458
other students want to read.

494
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,208
Then they'll come
to the library.

495
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,750
So there's no reason for
you to come here anymore.

496
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,708
[KASUMI]
From this moment forward,

497
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,500
I vow to become the woman
of your dreams, Handa!

498
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,291
Well. I guess this
is your last return!

499
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,166
[HANDA whines]

500
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,458
[HANDA sighs] I can't believe
the librarian told me

501
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,583
to my face she didn't
want me coming back.

502
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,708
Man. You must have
done something

503
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,208
to really piss her off.

504
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,333
All I did was tell her the book
had the wrong dust jacket.

505
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not like I
wanted to say it,

506
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,541
but I couldn't let the next
person go through what I did.

507
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,041
[KAWAFUJI]
Oh. You mean that romance novel?

508
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,250
[HANDA] I didn't realize
that's what it was.

509
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,041
[KAWAFUJI] How could you not
figure that out with a title

510
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,875
like <i>The Bookshelf of Love</i> ?

511
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,958
[HANDA]
Huh. That's a good point.

512
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,708
But she did ask me what
my thoughts were on it.

513
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,208
And seeing as how
I didn't read it,

514
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
I just told her what
you said about it.

515
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,166
[KAWAFUJI]
How I was touched

516
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,166
by the librarian's
pride in her work?

517
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,583
Yeah, I'm glad you read it,

518
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,000
or I wouldn't have had
anything to say.

519
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,875
[KAWAFUJI] Happy to be
of service, my friend.

520
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:08,000
[HANDA sighs] You really are
the only good person I know.

521
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,875
[KASUMI] Handa doesn't need
to come to the library

522
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,958
to see me anymore.

523
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:17,000
Because from now on,
I'll be going to see him.

524
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,666
[KASUMI laughs]

525
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,208
[HANDA] It's almost time
for the big event

526
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,875
that everybody's
been waiting for.

527
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,333
The class field trip.

528
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,833
All right then folks,
are you all ready to go?

529
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,666
[HANDA] But this will be
the greatest challenge

530
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,375
I've ever faced in my life.

531
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,666
After all, the other
members of my group are...

532
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,916
...the super flashy playboy.

533
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,416
The truant.

534
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,791
The schemer.

535
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,666
And...

536
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,875
...that guy.

537
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,541
Don't get too out of
hand just because

538
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,083
we're going to Kyoto, okay?

539
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,166
[STUDENTS]
Okay.

540
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,416
[KAWAFUJI]
Next time,

541
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,791
"Handa- <i>kun</i> and
the School Trip."

542
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,041
You're gonna love it.
