[AIZAWA]
Hey, Handa.

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:16,291
Could you take these printouts
to Akane Tsutsui's house please?

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,541
Uh?

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,666
It seems I've angered
you somehow.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,583
That Tsutsui?

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,416
[KAWAFUJI] There's a
student in Handa's class

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,666
that no one has seen
in a very long time.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,291
[AIZAWA] Don't worry. All you
have to do is hand it to him.

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,625
I wrote a note inside
that should cover things.

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,333
He's a bit of a runt and
not exactly the manly type,

11
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,500
so he was probably
picked on a lot.

12
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,291
Even his name sounds
kind of girly.

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,375
[HANDA] Sounds like he
really had it rough.

14
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,541
Poor guy.

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,833
[ringing]

16
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,958
Okay. He's not home.

17
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,458
[HANDA] Lucky me!
I'll just put in the mail slot.

18
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,833
[TSUTSUI]
Hey.

19
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,958
You got some business
at my place?

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,666
[TSUTSUI] You screw with me
and I'll mess you up, punk.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,250
[HANDA]
He's like one of those wrestlers

22
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,583
who cheats when the
ref isn't watching!

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,125
I, uh.

24
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,166
I just need to deliver this
to Akane Tsutsui, that's all.

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,958
Well, you're looking
straight at him.

26
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,625
[gasps]

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,416
[HANDA]
This Akane?

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,333
As in, the same Akane
who got picked on

30
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,500
and stopped coming to class?

31
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,541
That's me.

32
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,750
[HANDA]
Seriously?

33
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,375
He doesn't look like Akane.

34
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,500
He looks like he'd eat
Akane for breakfast.

35
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,291
Actually, at his size, he
might eat several Akanes.

36
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,625
Damn it.

37
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,833
Last thing I need is someone
waving this around.

38
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,958
Anyway, you don't
even need to say it.

39
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,875
You're here 'cause you want
me to come back to school,

40
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,000
aren't you?

41
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,375
No. I just need to
give you this. Okay?

42
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,083
[TSUTSUI] I ain't going back,
you hear me?

43
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,166
No way!

your ground on this one.

45

He didn't even blink!

46
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,458
That's freaky!

47
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,291
You think you're a badass?

48
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,250
[HANDA] I should probably
be freaking out right now,

49
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,625
but I'm frozen solid.

50
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,708
All right then,
I'll tell you a story.

51
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,791
Happened last year.

52
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,791
Buncha jerks were bullying me.

53
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,500
Who do you think you are, wuss?

54

twerp, you know that?

Are you gonna cry?

Damn it, he's so freakin' cute!

It's sick! Look at
those eyelashes!

You're making me
extremely uncomfortable!

they taunted me.

You're too fragile
to play with us!

me the cold shoulder.

[GIRL STUDENT 3A]
Stop seducing my boyfriend!

64
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,541
[TSUTSUI] And with girls,
it was even worse.

65
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,666
By the end of the first
semester, I was at my limit.

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,375
I shut myself in my room,

tears running down the face
of my tiny, weak body.

68

Then one day--a
miracle happened.

You wanna get swole with
sick muscles like these?

Ditch the gym and
put on this belt

and you'll be flexin'
with the best of them

00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,958

I stood alone atop a

Now that I know I'm the

I'm not interested
in making friends.

force me to go to school.

Tsutsui, what's going on here?
How do you know Handa?

[grunts] We're just in the
same class, that's all!

That is a lie!

is gonna squash us like bugs!

I don't wanna die.
I'm outta here!

We'll get you next time!

[TSUTSUI] Seems like everyone
knows this Handa guy but me.

00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:48,083
What the hell went down
at school after I quit?

What do I care?

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,625
I'm not going back.

[AIZAWA]
Wow, Handa!

I just heard the news
from the front office

178
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,166
and I can hardly believe it!

to Tsutsui, but nice work!

Oh my.

00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,583
He's a great deal larger than
his school photo implied.

00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,083
[HANDA]
Imagine how I felt.

00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,791
It's good to have him back...

187

[TSUTSUI] Handa. I know I'm
just some thug right now.

188
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,791
I'm not worthy to be friends
with a guy like you.

So instead, please think of me
as your personal security guard.

Someone, help!

Hey, Kondo! Let's walk
to home ec together.

197
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,791
[KONDO]
My name is Yukio Kondo.

198
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,208
Just a regular teenager.

199
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,250
Average in grades,
average in sports.

200
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,083
Got a couple of friends
and no enemies.

201
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,208
I don't need to be popular
and I don't need to stand out.

202
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,416
This is the perfect
high school life.

203
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,750
I'm just gonna go with the flow

204
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,416
and drift right
through graduation.

205
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,041
[HAYASHI]
Can't the girls cook for us?

206
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,000
[KONDO]
Why don't you ask them that?

207
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,208
Today we'll make salad, sweet
and sour pork, and pudding.

208
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,333
Now, break into groups
if you haven't already.

209
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,125
[KONDO] Then one day,
a tragedy happened.

210
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,625
I ended up in the wrong group

211
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,583
and my beloved normalcy
was burned to the ground.

212
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,875
First, there was that
stuck-up class rep,

213
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,791
or vice class rep,
Junichi Aizawa.

214
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,583
Then there was Reo Nikaido,
a former model.

215
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,583
With just a wave of his finger,
mobs of girls come flocking.

216
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,541
This one is Akane Tsutsui.

217
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,625
He disappeared for a semester
and came back a monster.

218
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,625
And finally...

219
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,083
...there was him.

220
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,166
The least average and least
normal student: Sei Handa.

221
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,083
A charismatic superstar
cloaked in mystery.

222
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,291
To some, a gentle
and benevolent god.

223
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,291
To others, a demon with
an inescapable wrath!

224
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,541
I can't take it!

225
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,458
This is too much
pressure for me!

226
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, Tsutsui can
wash the vegetables,

227
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,125
Kondo can peel them
after he's done,

228
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,916
and Reo can ready the dishes.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,625
Hey shrimp, who died and
put you in charge here?

230
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,750
We've got a real leader
in this group, y'know.

231
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,583
Yep. That's what I was thinking.

232
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,833
C'mon, guys, don't fight.

233
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,500
Allow me to explain the
situation more clearly.

234
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,875
[REO, KONDO, TSUTSUI]
Uh?

235
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,375
Handa can't be the leader,

236
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,125
because he has to relax while
we prepare a meal for him.

237
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,041
Oh! Good call! I get it now!

238
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,875
I'll give instructions
from the textbook.

239
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,916
You know I can't cook
for crap, right?

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,958
Same here.

241
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,791
That's fine--we can
count on Kondo.

242

[KONDO]
Huh?! Maybe a little...

243
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,125
[TSUTSUI]
What does that mean?

244
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,458
[KONDO]
That's weird.

245
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,750
Handa's getting
special treatment,

246
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,041
but he looks really
lonely over there.

247
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,958
But, this is for class, so Handa
needs to participate, too.

248
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,166
[HANDA]
I don't care.

249
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,291
Who said I wanted
to do this anyway?

250
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,833
[KONDO]
Huh?

251

[HANDA] If you guys wanna go
to the trouble, that's fine.

This class is for housewives
anyway, right?

253
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,041
It's not like I'm ever
gonna use any of this.

If you wanna lower yourselves,
then be my guest.

You heard him!

257
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,791
Handa has his pride
to uphold, after all.

258
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,958
We have to honor
that, right guys?

259
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,750
[KONDO] Uh. He was
obviously putting on an act.

260
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,958
Is there some sort of
"weird people secret code"

261
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,208
I'm not in on or something?

[REO]
Hey! You're pretty good at this!

263

[KONDO]
I think I'm just normal.

264
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,958
Is that it?

265
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,500
Why don't we put
them on this plate?

266
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,208
Are you stupid?
That's too small.

267
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,333
There're bowls on the
shelf right over there.

268
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,583
[sighs]

269
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,041
[KONDO] I heard scary
rumors about these guys,

270
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,041
but they're actually
pretty harmless.

271
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,416
Well, excluding Handa at least.

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,708
[REO] I'm the only one with
any sense of aesthetic here,

273
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,333
so I'll arrange the salad.

274
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,375
I'll make it look like
a rose in bloom!

275

Extra special, just for Handa!

276

[KONDO] Gross! Also, that looks
more like a cactus than a rose!

With a lovely aurora
of mayo and ketchup!

278
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,583
[KONDO] This is like-
straight-up bullying.

279

See? Handa's about to
flip out over there!

280

[SUZUNOKI laughing]

281
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,083

rice started, too.

282
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,083
[KONDO]
Huh?

283
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,666
[KONDO]
Is he leaving?

284
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,750
No...

285
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,625
Maybe he wants to
cook the dessert?

286
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,333
Well, "cooking" is a
little bit of a stretch,

287
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,916
since you only need
to add hot water.

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,500
[HANDA] "Just add water?"
That's ridiculous.

289
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,625
Screw this.

290
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,458
[KONDO]
So, he's not making pudding?

291
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,500
Then what is he making?

292
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,166
[HANDA] If you want to
make something good,

293
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,875
you have to make
it from scratch.

294
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,083
Cooking is an art
and I'm an artist.

295
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,000
My pudding will be perfect!

296
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,166
First, a hint of brandy.
Not too much.

297
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
Then an egg.

298
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,041
Based on the color,

299
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,375
I'm guessing that caramel's
made with soy sauce and sugar.

300
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,750
Then add a little chocolate
to even out the flavor,

301
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,291
salt to bring out the sweetness,

302
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,458
and potato starch for
the right consistency.

303
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,708
I'll show them!

304
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,291
[KONDO] I take it back.
Maybe Handa's the bully.

305
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,208
So this is how I'm going
to die, isn't it?

306
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,875
[AIZAWA screams]
Please, no violence!

307
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,916
[KONDO]
Whoa! Whoa! What's going on?

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,333
This moron told me the
wrong amount of oil!

309
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,791
[AIZAWA] You should've checked
before you put it in the pan!

310
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
It'll be fine!

311
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,625
We can drain it. There's no need
to bust any heads, okay?

312

Oh, uh-- No.

Wait. I think they're
right over there.

Sorry about this.

Yeah. You just keep doing
that weird thing you're doing

Now would you mind
explaining yourself?

Well. I thought it would
be bad if they found out

Maybe.

Sorry.

Even after all that, I still
needed you to carry my paper.

491
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,750
Getting stuck was an accident,

492
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,166
but you were planning
the paper thing.

That was a close one.

So, do you do that every time
a classmate comes by?

I don't hide when
I'm alone, of course.

Black bean tea.

We'll have a black bean tea
and a black coffee, then.

No. Why would you ask that?

I heard that he was
writing poems

and selling them on
the street around here.

Even though he's so popular,

Kawafuji treats me
just like anyone else.

in middle school.

He was excited to meet another
kid who loved calligraphy.

kinds of brushes,

of an oddball, but deep down,

he was like any other kid
and we got along great.

Can you deliver this to
Handa for me, please?

I wasn't the one she
was interested in.

a beautiful girl

from the world.

already been done.

and tell him how much the
