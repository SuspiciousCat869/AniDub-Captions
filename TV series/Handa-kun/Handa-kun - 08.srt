[AIZAWA] All right, guys.

00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,083
It's up to us to make sure
Handa has fun on this trip!

[REO]
Hey, guys?

167
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,958
Random thought, but this inn
is like 580 years old, right?

168
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,291
[TSUTSUI]
Looks pretty new if you ask me.

169
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,375
[AIZAWA] It's probably been
renovated since then.

170
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,916
[REO] I was hoping there'd
be some sign of its history.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,625
Like ghosts.

[HANDA gasps]

173
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,041
I'm sure there's some.

174
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,791
I mean, Kyoto's been home to a
lot of battles over the years.

175
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,291
With all that negative energy,

176
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,041
someone with a
really nasty grudge

177
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,875
might have left behind a
vengeful spirit lying in wait.

[TSUTSUI]
Mm?

You think they're
waiting? For what?

00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,708
Someone who's strong enough
to finish what they started.

It fell from above.
Must be Shiro High.

Those lousy bastards!
We should take 'em down!

186
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,500
Right, Handa?

187
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,458
[HANDA]
Uh...

188
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,916
Whoa. He's asleep.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,208
Harassment like that doesn't
faze him at all, I guess.

expected any less!

Calm down, I proclaim.

Keep calm, Tsu-Tsu,

Well, if you'll
follow me, ladies.

It's time for the next
location, I proclaim.

A Ryoma tour!

219

[KONDO]
What should we do, Aizawa?

220
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,041
We don't have much choice but to
act like we didn't see anything.

221
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,583
That way, it's only Tsu-Tsu
that gets expelled.

222
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,791
[NAGAMASA] I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

223
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,916
[AIZAWA]
I guess I should have expected

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,583
you to find us, Nagamasa.

225
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,791
Wait a second, you've
actually heard of me?

226
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,583
I make it a point to know
everyone who earns

227
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,166
the top 100 scores in
the nationwide exam.

228
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,500
So yes, you're Souichi Nagamasa.

229
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,833

in the last exam.

He barely made it.

232

[NAGAMASA] Considering
you always take first,

233
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,083
I assumed you would never give
anyone else a second thought.

234
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,875
A person's test score
isn't everything.

235
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,208
That's a valuable lesson
I learned from Handa.

236
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,458
Oh?

237
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,791
I must say, I'm happy to
hear you think that way.

238
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,833
After all, it means you'll
have an easier time

239
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,666
accepting your defeat
once Ichimiya

is recognized as the king
of both our schools.

That's how it is?
A declaration of war.

By the way, which historical
figure are you?

time is near, I proclaim!

Do you guys only know
Ryoma Sakamoto?

00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
you've got a good
sense of style!

247
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,208
[exhales] That's not
much of a compliment

248
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,041
seeing as you dress
like a mannequin.

249

But thanks, wannabe.

know what you mean.

[KOJIKA] I mean there's
a boy at your school

252
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,500
that's cuter than you
could ever dream of being.

253
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,750
Huh?

254

meet him on this trip.

[KOJIKA] Last year at
the Cultural Festival,

257
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,000
I saw a guy with an androgynous
style like mine.

He was the vision of an angel!

So, did he come with
you? Where is he?

he transferred.

the staple souvenir of Kyoto!

264

[JYOMOTO grunts] You bought a
wooden sword, too. Impressive.

265
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,208
I felt I had to,
even though my buds

266
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,333
kept trying to talk me out of it
'cause it'd "get in the way."

267
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,958
[JYOMOTO] I feel ya.
My friends felt the same.

268
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,916
They told me it would
collect dust in the corner

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,291
and that I'd never use it.

270

[BOTH yell]

271
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,791
I can't believe the way
the Handa Force is acting

272
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,375
around those guys
from Shiro High.

273
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,875
Yeah, it's tough
being in a group

274
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,416
with the popular kids, huh?

275
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,916
Eh?

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,166
But at the same time,

277
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,541
it feels good to support
cool people like we do.

278
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,291
Because then we're important!

279
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,458
[KONDO]
Uh...?

280
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,041
Without plain people like us,

281
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,333
Ichimiya wouldn't
stand out as much!

282

We're the reason his
greatness gets to shine

283

the way it is!

Sorry, but I don't worry about
that social standing stuff.

286

Then what's your purpose for
being in the Handa Force?

287
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,250
It has to be to elevate Handa!

288
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,833
With support and stability,

289
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,416
we raise our leaders to reach
the pinnacle of their potential!

If I didn't know better,

I'd think even Handa wants
a picture with him.

Uh?

311
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,500
That's a pretty good
photo of you, Ichimiya.

312
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,458
[HANDA]
So, that's his real name.

313
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,958
I guess aside from being a
student at that other school,

314
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,500
he also works here as
a character tour guide.

315
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,250
[KONDO]
Handa? Handa!

316
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,333
[gasps]

317
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,666
I hate to ruin your fun,
but you know,

318
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,125
you gotta return that costume.

319
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,666
Here, let me help you!
I'll even turn it in for you!

320
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,250
See you back at the room!

321
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,000
[KONDO] Guess this was payback
for that thing on the train.

322
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,458
That Ichimiya guy acts nice,
but he's pretty spiteful.

323
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,041
[OKAYAMA] It's not uncommon
to see squabbles

324
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,791
between schools break out.

325
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,041
But that doesn't excuse
your actions.

326
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,333
The three of you are going
to stay here like this

327
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,916
until it's time for bed.

328
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,041
[KONDO]
Thanks for coming.

329
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
Aizawa asked me
to pick up a gift

330
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,416
for the Student
Council President,

331
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,583
but it's kind of trick to pick
out something for her y'know?

332
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,916
[HANDA]
Mm...

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,833
[KONDO] Okay, you don't
want to be here. I get it.

334
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,375

00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,833
[KONDO]
Phew! That was a close one.

339
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,333
[HANDA grunting]
My arm!

Hey, there. What are you doing?

He's done for!

00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,583
I was reaching under to
get something I dropped,

343
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,208
but now I can't get my arm out.

Man, we've all be there
before. Let's help.

345
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,833
[JYOMOTO]

[ALL grunting]

00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,541
Is your arm okay?

Yeah. Thanks, I appreciate it.

[ALL]
It's Han--!

350
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,375
It's the guys from Shiro High!

00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,750
How's it going?

352
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,666
So, what brings you fellows
to the souvenir shop?

353
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,416
[KOJIKA]
What the heck did you just do?

354
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,583
Wasn't that Handa?

355
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,625
Handa's here?

356
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,958
Where? No way!

357
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,208
Hold on! You're right!
It's Handa!

[HANADA]
It's me!

[JYOMOTO]
He's tryin' ta sneak past us!

360
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,208
[KOJIKA]
So, this is the real one?

361
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,708
[NAGAMASA]
Seems like it!

362
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,250
Sorry I blindsided you.

363
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,000
[HANDA]
What was that for?

364
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,625
Hey, Kondo.

365
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,375
Yeah, what?

366
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,750
Listen.

367
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,333
I know you removed the candy
that Ichimiya planted.

368
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
If you keep taking action
against my leader,

369
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,583
we're gonna have problems.

370
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,916
I'm not looking for trouble,

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,333
but you guys should
leave Handa alone.

372
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,291
He may seem cold, but he's
actually really sensitive.

373
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,416
Sounds rough, but only one
of our kings will survive.

374
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
Mark my words.

375
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,208
You're so much fun to
hang out with, Ichimiya,

376
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,958
it's like you're a
prince or something!

377
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,083
You probably feel that way
because he's so well spoken.

378
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,458
He's way more of a gentleman
than that Handa.

379
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,708
I dunno. Comparing them feels
like apples and oranges.

380
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,125
Especially because we've
never spoken to Handa.

381
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,875
[ICHIMIYA]
Wait, are you being serious?

382
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,750
I was under the
impression Handa was

383
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,875
the most popular kid
in your school.

384
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,375
He is.

385
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,666
But no one really talks to him,
not even the Handa Force.

386
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,875
Uh! Speaking of, they just
stepped out of the store!

387
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,875
See you later, Ichimiya!

388
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,583
Don't worry, there's no way
you're going to lose to him!

389
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,083
Yeah, he's just a loner with
no real friends, anyway!

390
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,625
Would you mind giving me
a moment to myself?

391
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,208
[HANDA]
Damn it. I'm so lost.

392
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,916
I'll be lucky if I can
find my way back

393
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,125
before some ghost
turns me into its lunch!

394
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,458
Uh?

395
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,541
My, what perfect timing.

396
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,708
I was hoping to see you.

397
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,916
Do you have a moment
to speak with me?

398
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,125
I guess I do.

399
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,583
[ICHIMIYA]
Don't you find it tiring?

400
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,083
Find what?

401
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,250
Being what people
want you to be.

402
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,791
As opposed to what
you really are.

403
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,625
I'm supposed to be perfect,
never show any faults.

404
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,500
It's difficult being popular.

405
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,208
[HANDA]
Now he's bragging?

406
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,125
[ICHIMIYA]
Tell me, Handa.

407
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,125
[HANDA]
Uh?

408
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,250
When you're with others,

409
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,666
do you feel surrounded
by enemies?

410
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,125
Not really.

411
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,291
I wouldn't say that's a pressure
I come across too often.

412
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,916
Don't worry, if
there's one person

413
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,791
you can open up to in
the world, it's me.

414
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,583
I'm no ordinary commoner.

415
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,041
Together, we may
converse as kings!

416
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,750
Now, reveal to me your
disappointment! Your truth!

417
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,708
[HANDA]
Commoners? Kings?

418
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,625
He talks like we're in some
kind of roleplaying game.

419
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,541
He's trying to trick me
into saying something dumb,

420
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,083
so he can spread gossip.

421
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,875
Forgive me.

422
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,625
I didn't mean to make
you uncomfortable.

423
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,625
Let's try again.

424
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,875
Never mind Kings, why don't
we start out as friends?

425
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,750
[TSUTSUI, AIZAWA]
Handa!

426
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,625
[REO]
He's nowhere to be found.

427
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,500
What if those Shiro High guys
managed to get the drop on him,

428
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,583

Beats me. We haven't
seen him at all.

Is he missing or something?

If he is,

436
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,250
we can ask Ichimiya to give
you a hand finding him.

437
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,250
One of his 10,000
followers from Kyoto

Handa somewhere.

All right!

Don't get cozy with them!

Maybe, but they're in trouble.

Yeah. Plus, we'll owe you one.

446
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,583
But helping them find
their leader only serves

447
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,750
to further strengthen
Ichimiya's competition!

What exactly's goin' on?

457
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,958
[TSUTSUI]
Did Handa just refuse

458
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,500
Ichimiya's gesture
of friendship?

459

00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,875
Besides, you have friends.

466
00:19:58,958 --> 00:19:59,708
[NAGAMASA]
Ichimiya!

467
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,083
[gasps]

468
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,916
What happened while you
were alone here with Handa?

469
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,958
Are you hurt?

470
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,666
A king should never
face his enemy

471
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,250
without the support of his men!

472
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,375
[KOJIKA, JYOMOTO, NAGAMASA]
Ichimiya!

473
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,000
[ICHIMIYA]
I see.

474
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:15,041
This whole time, I only
saw them as my underlings.

475
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,458
Handa, you shouldn't
wander off like that!

476
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,583
[HANDA]
Complaint.

477
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,458
If it took much longer
to find you,

478
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,083
there's no telling what
I would have done!

479
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,541
[HANDA]
Threatening.

480
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,500
We'll forget all about this
if you buy us some juice!

481
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,541
[HANDA]
Extortion.

482
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,333
Let's just get out
of here already.

483
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,791
[HANDA]
Demand.

484
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,916
[ICHIMIYA]
Meanwhile, by Handa's standards,

485
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,833
everyone is his friend.

486
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,416
We're not them,
and they're not us.

487
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
There's no reason for
our two groups to fight.

488
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,250
We should become friends.

489
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,041
[ICHIMIYA] But first, I have
to become friends with you.

490
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,375
[ALL]
Ichimiya...

491
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,000
What the hell are you
trying to say right now?!

492
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,916
[gasps]

493
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I've devoted my life to
you being number one.

494
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,083
But Handa's... ruined you!

495
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:00,750
[TSUTSUI]
Here he comes!

496
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,625
[KOMICHI]
Handa!

497
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,625
[AIZAWA]
Handa, watch out!

498
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,916
[KOMICHI]
Handa!

499
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,375
Ow!

500
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,166
[KOMICHI whimpers]

501
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,708
Hey, what's your problem?

502
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,541
You told me you don't care about
this social standing stuff!

503
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,833
[KONDO] I also told you
to leave Handa alone.

504
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:21,750
That even though he appears
cold, he's sensitive.

505
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,666
[screams] Ichimiya, save me!

506
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,000
It's okay, calm down!

507
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,750
You've done enough, Yuki.

508
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,833
I'm sorry. Can you please
forgive him for me?

509
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,000
He can't help it.

510
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,833
As long as we're all cool.

511
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,541
[TSUTSUI]
Phew. Back to normal.

512
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,583
Well then, I think we can
put this whole affair

513
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,958
between our schools to rest.

514
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,625
Sorry I hit you.
My body moved on impulse.

515
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,708
See ya.

516
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,458
Take good care of
your wooden sword.

517
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,541
I know a shrine where you
can pray for good skin!

518
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,250
Yeah? I'm there!

519
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,041
[NAGAMASA] I will look forward
to seeing you at the next exam.

520
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,875
[AIZAWA]
Hm...

521
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,875
So, this is goodbye
for now. Take care.

522
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,666
[ICHIMIYA] It would appear
he has the ability

523
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,208
to awaken a person's
hidden nature.

524
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:10,958
Sei Handa, you are
truly powerful.

525
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,416
Yeah. No doubt about it.
He's one of ours.

526
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,791
Just tell him to hang tight
until I get there.

527
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,541
[HANDA]
So, yeah.

528
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,500
The trip was about
as bad as I expected.

529
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,625
[KAWAFUJI] Sounds like
it was a hell of a time.

530
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,750
[HANDA] I know it would
have been difficult

531
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,041
'cause we're in
different classes,

532
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,541
but I'm sorry we never met up.

533
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,625
[KAWAFUJI] Ah. It's fine, I
actually didn't go to Kyoto.

534
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,208
The whole school trip thing
is too much of a pain.

535
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,625
[ALL laughing]

536
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,250
[HANDA]
Huh. You don't say...

537
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,708
[KAWAFUJI] Next time,
"Handa- <i>kun</i> and the Frog."

538
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,583
"Handa- <i>kun</i> and the Stalker."

539
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,291
You're gonna love it.
