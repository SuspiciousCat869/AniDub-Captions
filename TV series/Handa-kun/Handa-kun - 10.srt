Good morning.

Good morning, Yuki.

This is how I always look.

[TSUTSUI] You should
take a cue from Handa.

The guy's got style.

[AIZAWA] Not to mention
that sharp look in his eye.

I think I'm being watched.

It's obvious something's

How about this? After school,

32

we'll go to the Handa Force
headquarters, and we'll talk.

33
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,125
Do you promise not to make
fun of me if I tell you?

34
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,166
[REO]
I would never!

35
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,833
Not even if the
thing bugging you

36

was that nothing
was bugging you!

[KONDO] You're making
fun of me right now.

Maybe a little.

[KONDO]
Should've known.

Reo doesn't have a
care in the world.

I can't expect him to
relate to my problems.

That can only mean one thing.

It's a love letter!

But that's crazy...

I've barely spoken to any
girls at all this year!

Well, either way,
this is awesome!

53

Except I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do with this thing.

54
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,208
I guess I could ask Reo.

No, wait!

Showing this note to everyone

would be rude to the girl
who gave it to me.

Besides, how do I know
it's a love letter?

It's not like I've ever
gotten one before.

happened to me last year.

ripped off my clothes,

86
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,875

call a five-out-of-ten

on the beauty scale.

Wait, you mean you know her?

what that was about.

average in every category.

Which, no offense, makes
you perfect for each other,

95

Phew. That's a relief to hear.

any idea who this girl is.

That way you'll look your
best for her confession.

And we should come up with
a romantic response, as well.

we made in class as a card?

Even if I'm boring, being

by association.

159
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,958
[laughs]

160
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,250
You okay?

161
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:45,791
Yeah, totally fine.
Don't worry. 100%-- okay!

162
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,083
[ALL gasp]

163
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:47,916
[AIZAWA]
Yuki?!

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,625
[REO]
He's so not okay!

165
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,208
[TSUTSUI]
Wait, come back!

166
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,208
[KONDO] I've spent my whole life
being nothing but average,

167
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,583
so why did I get
so carried away?

168
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,416
Once a duckling, always
a duckling, right?

169
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,958
For a second,

170
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,375
I actually believed someone
thought I was cool like Handa.

171
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,041
I'm so stupid.

172
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,750
[BOTH gasp]

173
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,208
S-Sorry about that.

174
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,791
Yeah. Me, too.

175
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,958
[KONDO]
Oh, it's you.

176
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,958
Uh! Wait, I know you!

177
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,875
[inaudible]

178
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,041
You attacked me in Kyoto.

179
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,541
[chuckles nervously]

180
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,916
So, uh, what are you
doing out here, anyway?

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,458
Are all those flowers for class?

182
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,916
No, of course not!

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,416
Don't go jumping to
conclusions, okay?

184
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,708
They're, uh... Well...

185
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,916
I'm gonna use them
to harass people!

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
[KONDO] He does realize I
didn't mean that, doesn't he?

187
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,458
On that note, why does he always
say things he doesn't mean?

188
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,333
All right then, good
luck with all that.

189
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,250
I don't need luck! Harassing
people's easy for me!

190
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,125
[HANDA groans]

191
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,708
[KONDO]
Handa goes through so much

192
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,916
trying to live up to what
people think of him.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,875
But he's really just a shy
guy with a kind heart.

194
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,416
That's probably why he's
swayed by others so easily.

195
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,458
Same as me.

196
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
Handa. Take this.

197
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,500
[HANDA]
Uh?

198
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,291
Well, I'll see you in class.

199
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,458
[HANDA]
Uh. Hold on.

200
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,333
[KONDO]
Huh?

201
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,958
Thank you. I... guess.

202
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,708
No thanks necessary.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,666
[KONDO] I think I belong in
the Handa Force after all.

204
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,333
[REO]
Yukicchi!

205
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,750
Huh?

206
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,333
[AIZAWA] What are you doing
running off by yourself?

207
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,833
[KONDO]
Ha, ha. You guys.

208
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,333
[AIZAWA laughing]

209
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
[KONDO]
I'm good.

210
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,125
[TSUTSUI]
Don't scare us like that.

211
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
As long as you're okay.

212
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,541
[KONDO]
I don't know how I ended up

213
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,125
joining them in the first place.

214
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,833
But I'm sure Handa had
something to do with it.

215
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,041
[HANDA humming]

216
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,291
[KONDO] He just has
that effect on people.

217
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,625
[HANDA]
That was so nice of him.

218
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,708
[HANDA] Ah! He really does
harass people with flowers!

219
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,625
[KAWAFUJI] And so their
relationship got even worse.

220
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,166
[NEO] We are the
<i>Bishoujo</i> Pictures Club!

221
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,875
What is a <i>bishoujo</i> ? you ask?

222
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,083
Some may say it's
simply a "cute girl,"

223
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,583
but those people are casuals!

224
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,250
Filthy plebs!

225
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,666
In order to better explore
the concept of " <i>Bishoujo</i> ,"

226
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,208
we release a periodic bulletin,

227
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,125
filled with manga and
charming illustrations.

228
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,833
Hmm...

229
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,708
[TAKOYAKI]
Let's see!

230
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,000
[NEO] Despite having
only three members,

231
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,208
we're quite satisfied with our
club activities. However...

232
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,333
The Student Council has
decided to terminate

233
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,416
your cute girl club
as of this term.

234
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,708
[NEO]
...we are in a serious bind now.

235
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,208
No, you can't!

236
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,333
We are not just cogs
in the imperial machine

237
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,791
that can be taken out!

238
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,958
My heart aches in pain!

239
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,500
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

240
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,375
Why is the Empire taking its
base frustrations out on us?!

241
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,375
Because, there's no
reason the school

242
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,250
should be spending its precious
funds on three students' hobby.

243
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,500
Understand?

244
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,791
Damn your eyes!

245
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,166
Your words don't scare us,
Student Council dog!

246
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,583
Look, you guys
are more than free

247
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,916
to keep the club running
if you fund it yourselves.

248
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So why not make
something profitable?

249
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,708
What?!

250
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,833
How dare you imply that <i>What</i>
<i>is Bishoujo?</i> doesn't sell!

251
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Then how do you
explain that stack?

252
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,166
These books are worth
a lot of money!

253
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,291
The male 14 to 25
age group loves it!

254
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,625
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to make money

255
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,791
off of a self-published
manga, you fool?! 

256
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,625
No, but I'm sure if you made
a comic based on Handa's life,

257
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,666
it would sell great!

258
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,583
[ALL]
That's... kinda genius!

259
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,750
Of course, there's no telling

260
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,500
if he'd give you
permission to do that.

261
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,583
But, do you know what
you're saying?

262
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,708
That would require the
<i>Bishoujo Picture Club</i>

263
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,875
to draw a guy!

264
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,333
Well, yeah, that's obvious.

265
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,750
More like unacceptable,
as we've taken a vow

266
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,958
to only draw cute girls!

267
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,833
Manga staring male protagonists

268
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,750
does nothing to
progress the medium!

269
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,291
We will not be swayed by your
blasphemous words, heathen!

270
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,333
[NEO]
Away with you!

271
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,875
[ALL sigh]

272
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,541
We'll be coming by to pick up
recyclable paper next week,

273
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,458
so get your stack ready.

274
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,708
[ALL]
Get out of here!

275
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,083
[NEO]
It seems we're out of options.

276
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,541
The question is: what to draw?

277
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,541
Light bulb!

278
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,666
Yes, what've you got, Doctor?

279
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,458
[PSYCHO] Why don't we turn
Handa... into a cute girl?

280
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,333
[TAKOYAKI]
Uh... What you're suggesting

281
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,958
is a pretty drastic measure.

282
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,791
Wouldn't that defeat
the purpose?

283
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,125
Plus, it might be a little
on the creepy side.

284
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,166
Not if we explain
how it happens.

285
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,750
Then there will be
nothing keeping us

286
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,958
from making a gender-swap
slice-of-life comedy!

287
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,708
We'll just make up some story.

288
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,833
Let's do it.

289
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,041
[NEO] That was all the
convincing we needed.

290
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,875
Do we have any idea what
kind of character Handa is?

291
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,875
[TAKOYAKI] No clue. We stay
away from the popular crowd,

292
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,750
so we never really see him.

293
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:53,500
He's always by himself, so maybe
she should be a cool loner.

294
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,666
No. I've heard he's
compassionate,

295
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,333
so she'd be better as
an older sister figure.

296
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,250
Or a spunky tomboy
with a cool catchphrase.

297
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,791
[HANDA-CHAN]
Believe it.

298
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:10,291
[ALL groaning]

299
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,875
Okay, new plan: we split up

300
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,375
and make character profiles
based on our own tastes.

301
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,958
Yeah, good idea.

302
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,416
I mean, the character doesn't
have to be exactly like Handa.

303
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,583
Then we'll meet back up

304
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,375
once we've each finished
our first drafts.

305
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,708
Whichever manga is the
best is the one we sell.

306
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,375
May the best Handa- <i>chan</i> win!

307
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,750
Good luck, you guys!

308
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,791
Yeah!

309
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,500
[NEO] The only problem
with this new plan

310
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,458
is I still don't know
anything about Handa.

311
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,083
And I'll never make a good
manga without research.

312
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,625
My only hope is tricking him
into an interview.

313
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,625
It won't be easy without
something to catch his interest.

314
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,750
[NEO]
Hey, hot stuff!

315
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,791
[HANDA]
Uh!

316
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,000
[NEO]
I'm the magical maid Merina!

317
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,166
Will you please help me
cast a spell, Dear Master?

318
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,166
[NEO]
Take the bait, Handa!

319
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,375
[HANDA] Oh, no, someone's
talking to me.

320
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,041
Obviously this is some sort of
prank, but I sure don't get it.

321
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,250
[NEO]
Hello, Master?

322
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,333
[HANDA] What should I do?
Say something?

323
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,291
[NEO]
Oh, please help me!

324
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,000
Uh...

325
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,041
[NEO]
Yes!

326
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,791
[HANDA]
Why's your outfit so skimpy?

327
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,125
[NEO grunts]

328
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,791
[NEO] Well. Because I...
I like to feel the breeze!

329
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,541
[HANDA]
Wow. They responded!

330
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,875
Okay. I guess that's a reason.

331
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,416
[NEO]
I'm glad he replied.

332
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,750
For a second there,

333
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,833
I thought I was stupid
for taking this approach.

334
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,500
Gotta focus. Be one with Merina!
Then I can get closer to Handa!

335
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,708
[NEO] Tell me, Master.
What do you really think of me?

336
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,583
[HANDA] That's a pretty
forward thing to ask someone

337
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:43,583
you just met. But ignoring
them now would be rude.

338
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,458
Think... Be nice...

339
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,875
You seem fine...?

340
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,291
[NEO]
Wow! You think I'm fine?

341
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,541
Oh, my! You're such
a smooth operator!

342
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,875
[HANDA]
All right.

343
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,333
I don't know why, but they
seem happy with that.

344
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,625
[NEO chuckles]
So even Handa

345
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,791
is no match for Merina's
feminine charms!

346
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,291
[NEO]
I guess I can give him a treat.

347
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,083
[NEO] Oh, Master,
I can't contain myself!

348
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,458
I want to give you my body!

349
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,250
Will you please
take off my skirt?

350
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,458
[HANDA groans]

351
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,041
[NEO] Hurry, please!
Before someone sees us!

352
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,500
[NEO] It doesn't matter
how stoic he usually is,

353
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,375
he doesn't stand a chance
against Merina's sex appeal!

354
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,833
Once I see Handa's
kinky side in action,

355
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,916
I'll have everything
I need for my story!

356
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,625
[NEO]
Take it off! Take it off!

357
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,666
[HANDA groaning]

358
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,083
[NEO]
This is it!

359
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,375
[HANDA]
You may just be a toy,

360
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,791
but you're still a lady and
should be treated like one.

361
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,958
I don't need that
handkerchief back.

362
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:49,541
Next time, play with someone
who appreciates you.

363
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,416
Not me.

364
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,291
[NEO]
"Someone who appreciates her?"

365
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,500
Merina and I have been together
for over ten years now.

366
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,541
I've always treated
her this way.

367
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,666
Have I been taking
advantage of her?

368
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,708
Forgive me. I'm...
I'm so sorry, Merina!

369
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,083
I never even thought twice
about taking off your skirt!

370
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,333
Thank you, Handa.

371
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,791
You've shown me
there's another way!

372
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:18,541
I swear... the next comic I
draw will be worthy of you!

373
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,125
[HANDA]
I know.

374
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:25,333
[bell rings]

375
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,541
All right, who wants to present
their manga pitch first?

376
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,333
Oh, pick me, I wanna go!

377
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,541
[NEO] I like the
enthusiasm, Dr. Psycho.

378
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,291
Our story begins
with our heroine

379
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,000
bumping into Handa- <i>chan</i>
after coming around a corner.

380
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,416
Oh, I see!

381
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,875
A classic beginning.

382
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,000
By utilizing this
tried and true method,

383
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,583
it relieves the burden of
character development.

384
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,083
[gasps] Wait.
In this panel you...!

385
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,541
You exposed Handa- <i>chan</i> 's
p-p-p-p...!

386
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,208
Yeah, it's a little treat
to hook our readers early!

387
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,541
This isn't hentai, you goon!

388
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,291
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

389
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,541
What the heck's gotten
into you, chief?

390
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,541
Handa- <i>chan</i> would never
act so indecently!

391
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,458
Uh! But there's no point
in making a manga

392
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,083
without some fan service!

393
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,750
Handa- <i>chan</i> would never
resort to such a crude tactic!

394
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,416
As an <i>otaku</i> , you
have lost your way!

395

How about you both calm
down and read mine?

397
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,000
In here, she's a space soldier

398
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,500
that fights
intergalactic battles

399
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,041
for her captain boyfriend!

My poor face!

Don't tarnish her purity with
a two-bit love interest!

00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,958
[TAKOYAKI groans]

405
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,708
We're just following
the tropes of the genre!

406
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,416
Well don't!

407
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,333
The inner charm and natural
beauty of Handa- <i>chan</i> is all

408
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,791
that we'll need to have readers
coming back, begging for more!

409
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,041
Don't you dare imply
that our audience wants

410
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,458
quality entertainment!

411
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,958
For real, talk about
disappointing!

412
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,708
No one's happy
seeing word balloons

413
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,125
when they should be seeing
a girl's balloons instead!

414
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,750
[PSYCHO] Everyone goes
in expecting cleavage

415
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,791
and dirty jokes in these
kinds of stories!

416
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,041
[TAKOYAKI] You can't make this
something it isn't, Chief!

417
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,833
Why you...!

418
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,250
[NEO] I know you're right.
As much as I hate it.

419
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,916
But, in this case, we
have no other choice

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,875
but to take a
different approach.

421
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,791
What, do you think
the comic you wrote

422
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,333
is going to make us
change our minds?

423
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,041
Yes, I do.

424
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,041
I spent this whole past week
getting to know Handa- <i>chan</i> ,

425
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,208
and, quite frankly,
it changed me.

426
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,625
After this experience,

427
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,375
my standards for a
leading lady have matured.

428
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,583
So as we cast off this
drivel for recycling,

429
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,458
we now make room
for Handa- <i>chan</i> .

430

[BOTH gasping]

No way! How...?

432
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,458
What you see doesn't even
scratch the surface

433
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,833
of her compassion.

434
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,000
She is not unlike a goddess!

435
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,208
It's beautiful!

436
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,958
You're wrong. She's beautiful.

437
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,333
This is the heroine the world
has been looking for!

438
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,458
Handa- <i>chan</i> ! I'm not
worthy of your love!

439
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,250
This panel where she puts
the robe on the naked girl

440
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,125
is truly inspiring!

441
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,375
I know.

442
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,708
The first time I saw it,

443
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,375
I was so moved that I wept
openly like a child.

444
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,166
We can't waste any more time!

445
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,708
If we're going to
make our deadline,

446
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,500
we have to get the copies
ready for print!

You're right.

The school festival is
right around the corner!

But first, we need
Handa's permission.

What if he says no, though?

Nah, there's no way he can
decline after reading it!

00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,583
See? It's right here on the
desk waiting... for... you.

471
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,333
Someone must have come by
and collected it already.

472
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,333
Hang on. Where are...?

473
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,750
Is something wrong?

474
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,916
Oh, no. We left our...

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,708
...manga pages...

476
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,416
...on the table.

477
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,125
No, no, no, no!

478
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,166
[ALL whimpering]

479
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,958
[TAKOYAKI] You idiot! Why would
you put them with the box?

480
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,333
[NEO] I didn't think anyone
would just barge into the room!

481
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,583
[PSYCHO]
Who cares?

482
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,583
We gotta find them
before they're destroyed!

483
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,750
[NEO]
I staked my life on that manga!

484
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,416
Whoever took it is going to pay!

485
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,166
[TAKOYAKI] We have to hurry!
There isn't much time!

486
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,708
"Manga"?

487
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,875
[TAKOYAKI gasping]
It's leaving!

488
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,125
[ALL panting]

489
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,750
[TAKOYAKI]
I'm so tired!

490
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,625
Oh, no! Too late.

491
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,416
[NEO]
Handa?

492
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,791
But why is he
chasing the truck?

493
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,375
[HANDA] I'm the one
who threw them away!

494
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,166
[ALL gasping]

495
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,333
He's so fast.

496
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,750
Save Handa- <i>chan</i> !

497
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,666
[TAKOYAKI]
Whoa! The truck's coming back!

498
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,916
Handa did all that to protect
our <i>waifu</i> from harm!

499
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,041
Yatta!

500
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,375
Yeah! Guys! This is
the best day ever!

501
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,000
You were right all along, Chief,

502
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,416
Handa is as pure and as kind
as Handa- <i>chan</i> herself,

503
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,166
even if he isn't as cute!

504
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,625
[PSYCHO laughs] Let's make
sure they're undamaged!

505
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:42,916
Handa! Truly. Thank you.

506
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,333
[HANDA]
That was tough, but worth it.

507
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,833
I bet they were itching
to tell everyone

508
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,875
I threw away their
stuff on purpose.

509
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,416
[NEO]
Well? Have you found them yet?

510
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,833
[TAKOYAKI] Where are they?
Oh, wait, oh! Is this...?

511
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,708
Man, that sure was a close
one, wasn't it, Handa?

512
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,958
Wow, I wonder what
idiot threw them away.

513
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,958
[HANDA]
You trying to start something?

514
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,541
[TAKOYAKI]
Oh. They gotta be here.

515
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,458
[ALL gasping]

516
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,833
[HANDA grunts]

517
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,333
[HANDA-CHAN moans]

518
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,333
[HANDA gasping]

519
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,750
[NEO]
Yay! We found them at last!

520
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,541
[HANDA]
What the...?

521
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,833
[TAKOYAKI] We've still got a bit
before the school festival,

522
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,583
but our presales
are stacking up!

523
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,333
You know, none of this
would be happening

524
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,500
if Handa hadn't protected
our comics for us.

525
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,333
That's true.

526
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,541
What are you sketching now?

527
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,708
Is it a new cutie?

528
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
It's not what it looks like!

529
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,583
I'm just improving
my talents, okay?

530
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,708
[bell rings]

531
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,958
[KAWAFUJI]
That's all it took

532
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,916
for the chief to wander
down the forbidden path.
