1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,466
My name is Hideki Motosuwa.

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,233
I'll be turning 19 this year.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,600
Right now, I'm still 18.

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,366
This spring,
I'm planning on moving

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,466
to Tokyo and going to college!

6
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,666
Oh! There it is!

7
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,166
I'm going to be a
freshman in college!

8
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,266
At least, that's what I thought.

9
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,366
I got rejected!

10
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,533
I failed!

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,566
I'm going to be
a bum for a year!

12
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,500
That's it, I'm going
to prep school!

13
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,766
I'll study hard, and make sure

14
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,500
that I get into
college next year!

15
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,300
That's right,
if I'm going to go,

16
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:32,400
I'll go to Tokyo!

17
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,200
Well, the college I want
to go to is in Tokyo, right?

18
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,833
All right!

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,233
I'm gonna go to Tokyo!

20
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm finally here.

21
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:40,466
Tokyo really is a busy city,
just like I thought.

22
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,933
Now, where's my apartment?

23
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,633
It will take
approximately 45 minutes

24
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,766
to arrive at your destination.

25
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,500
You will then need to
switch trains at Ikebukuro.

26
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:57,266
It's a real Persocom!

27
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,333
Wow, this is the first time
I've seen one in real life!

28
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,300
Lately the whole world has been

29
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,800
talking about IT
and the Internet,

30
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,633
and how advanced it's getting.

31
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,666
It seems like it's
making the world

32
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,633
an easier place to live in.

33
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,866
The most amazing things
are these Persocoms.

34
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,533
They make them look
just like people!

35
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,300
I don't really
know much about it,

36
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,866
but I guess they can
do all kinds of things!

37
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,966
In the small town
where I come from,

38
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,000
out in the country, no one
has a computer like this!

39
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,400
They're so nice!

40
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:30,300
So cool! I want one!
I really want one!

41
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,300
Are you kidding?!

42
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,566
There's no way
I could afford one!

43
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,300
Uh...

44
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,700
It must be some
kind of performance.

45
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,766
What a strange guy...

46
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,066
Well it is spring...

47
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,333
Mommy I'm scared!

48
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Just don't look
him in the eye dear!

49
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,466
Man, that was embarrassing!

50
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:58,100
I've really gotta stop
talking to myself in public.

51
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,366
Up until now, the only
things I've ever talked

52
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,566
to were horses and cows.

53
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,766
Boy, those Persocoms sure

54
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,533
do look like real humans.

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
And, they're pretty cute too!

56
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,433
But man, they're so expensive.

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,833
I guess that's okay for
most people, though, huh?

58
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,833
I mean, does everyone out here

59
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,066
in the city have tons
of money or something?

60
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,766
I guess poor college
students-in-training

61
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,500
aren't allowed to
buy them. Is that it?

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,666
Ah, darn it all!

63
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,866
I wanna get my own computer!

64
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,433
I wanna send e-mail, too!

65
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,366
And more than anything

66
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,833
I wanna see those
internet porn sites!!

67
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,933
Porn-sites?

68
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,733
Um, uh, no, well I--

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,733
What did I say in front
of this pretty girl?

70
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Oh excuse me,

71
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:49,566
you see I was just trying
to find an apartment.

72
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,766
But I'm not really
sure where it is.

73
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,966
Maybe you've heard of it?

74
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,666
It's called the "Cub Jogasaki."
It's kind of a weird name.

75
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,433
I believe this is the place!

76
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Ahh!

77
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,533
This apartment building's
called the Gub Jogasaki.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,066
Oh! I see.

79
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,966
What?!

80
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,433
You must be Hideki Motosuwa.

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Uh,Yes.

82
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,633
My name is Chitose Hibiya.

83
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm the manager
of this building.

84
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,100
This is your apartment.

85
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,633
Oh.

86
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
The hot water and the
gas line are already set up.

87
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:26,000
And the circuit breakers
are over here.

88
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,033
Boy, it's a lot
smaller than I expected.

89
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,500
But I can't complain
it's all I can afford.

90
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:34,533
I put the boxes you sent
in your room for you.

91
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,966
I hope you don't mind?

92
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,166
No! Not at all! Thanks a lot!

93
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,733
I, just hope they
weren't too heavy

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,033
for you to carry all
the way up by yourself.

95
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,666
I'm really sorry about that.

96
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,133
It was no trouble at all.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,166
Mr. Shinbo carried
everything up for me.

98
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,666
Uh, Mr. Shinbo?

99
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,933
Yes, he should be
back any moment now.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,533
He's your next door neighbor.

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,500
He seems like a very
nice man, in room 204.

102
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,466
Oh I see.

103
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,433
I'll be sure to thank
him when I see him.

104
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,833
Well, it was a pleasure

105
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,200
to meet you Mr. Motosuwa.

106
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,833
The pleasure is all mine!

107
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,033
Thank you! Thank you.

108
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,033
How lucky am I

109
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,466
to have such a
beautiful manager?!

110
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,033
She said that she
lives in apartment 101.

111
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,466
Who knew I would
end up living in a place

112
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,833
right above a
pretty girl like her?

113
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:21,033
Huh? Okay, be right there!

114
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,466
Maybe it's her again.

115
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,133
Hello!

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Huh?

117
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,066
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

118
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,866
Congratulations on
your new apartment!

119
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,800
What is that?!

120
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,233
Master, that guy's really scary!

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
Hey sorry about that man.

122
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,566
I didn't mean
to catch you off guard.

123
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, I, uh...

124
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,633
Hey, we haven't
been introduced yet -

125
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm Hiromu Shinbo.

126
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,600
I live in the unit
right next door

127
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,033
to yours in number 204.

128
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,033
Oh!

129
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,666
You're the guy who
carried my stuff up here.

130
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,266
That's right!

131
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,666
Thank you very much!

132
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,200
I appreciate it Mr. Shinbo!

133
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,766
What's with all
the formal stuff?

134
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,166
Call me Shinbo!
So, how old are you?

135
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm eighteen.

136
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,600
So am I!

137
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,800
You're eighteen, too?

138
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:11,233
And tomorrow you're gonna
start Seki Prep School, right?

139
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,766
Um, yeah.

140
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,833
Well, I am too!

141
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,066
Losers club!

142
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,266
Hey! Really?!

143
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,566
Absolutely. Nice to meet ya!

144
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,066
So what is this thing?

145
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,800
Oh! That's my Persocom.

146
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,633
It's so small!

147
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,266
Well, it's a mobile unit.

148
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,700
Oh, I see.

149
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:29,766
Introduce yourself.

150
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,600
Aye!

151
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:34,066
I am Sumomo!
It's nice to meet you!

152
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,866
Wow she's amazing!!

153
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,633
Whoa, he's scary!

154
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:39,733
What's the big deal?

155
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,200
Haven't you seen one before?

156
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,000
You don't have
a mobile Persocom?

157
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:43,733
I wish!

158
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,700
I haven't got a Persocom at all.

159
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,333
You're kidding?!
That's kinda weird.

160
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
And even if I did buy one

161
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:50,766
I wouldn't know how to use it.

162
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,766
It's no big mystery.

163
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,300
Once you turn the switch,
they do the rest.

164
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,666
The OS takes care
of everything after that.

165
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,766
Ah! You're an expert
with these things.

166
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,833
Not really.

167
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,233
So can you do
everything with it?!

168
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,866
Yeah, sure!

169
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,766
I can get my phone calls,

170
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,833
go on the internet
and get all my e-mail.

171
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Really? The Internet too?!

172
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh yeah!

173
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,700
And porno sites too, of course!

174
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,100
Really? It can even
access porno sites?

175
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,233
Come on, porno sites
are the basics!

176
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,733
Porno sites! Porno sites!

177
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,766
Shall I warm that up for you?

178
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,166
Uh, yes please.

179
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,300
Right away, sir.

180
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,633
And when it's done,
I will call you.

181
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,766
Please have a
seat while you wait.

182
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,266
A-alright.

183
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,366
Thank you very much, sir!

184
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,900
Have a good evening!

185
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,000
Those Persocoms
really are amazing.

186
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,000
They can even
run cash registers.

187
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,766
Shinbo called his
Persocom Sumomo.

188
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,866
I didn't even know there

189
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,833
were such incredible machines!

190
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,100
He said he could make
phone calls with it.

191
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,633
Man, that's cool!

192
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,633
I doubt I'll ever be able
to afford one, though.

193
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,266
And even if I did have one,

194
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,866
I wouldn't know where to begin.

195
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,866
I don't know anything
about Persocoms.

196
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:01,033
But I've gotta check out
those porno sites someday.

197
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,766
Persocoms are cool.

198
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,900
They're shaped exactly
like real people.

199
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:08,833
I only wish I could find

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,300
a really cute one
lying around somewhere.

201
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,300
Course that'll never happen.

202
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,266
Oh my god it's a dead body!!

203
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,900
What am I gonna do?!
It must be a murder!

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
I can't believe it!

205
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,200
My first day in Tokyo, and here
I am at the scene of a crime!

206
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:39,200
What should I do?!

207
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,800
Okay, don't panic - let's see.

208
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,400
First I should call the police.

209
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,800
Or maybe I should
call an ambulance?

210
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:47,666
She has those-ears.

211
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,033
There're just like
the ears I saw

212
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,400
in the window at
the electronics store.

213
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:52,800
Phew!

214
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,200
So that's what she is.

215
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:55,700
And here I was thinking
it was some kind

216
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,300
of hideous murder or something.

217
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,066
Oh man!

218
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:05,833
Well, I gotta get back to my
apartment and get organized.

219
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,933
Wait a minute!

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,733
This is a Persocom.

221
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,733
And it was left out
here in the trash.

222
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,133
Which means that technically,
this is actually garbage.

223
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,466
And no one wants it,
so I can take it, right?

224
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,733
Right? Right?

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,366
Actually I would be
doing a good thing

226
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,033
for the environment
if I were to recycle her.

227
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,833
All that industrial
waste and dioxin.

228
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,200
We don't want more
holes in the ozone layer.

229
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,900
This is heavier than I thought.

230
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,800
This is how much
a Persocom weighs?!

231
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,500
Come on. You have to be kidding!

232
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,966
I'm gonna get squashed to death!

233
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,066
Oh man, I had no idea that's

234
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,866
how heavy computers
were supposed to be.

235
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:08,933
Well, I guess that's
what they mean

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,533
when they say "Heavy
then light upon booting"...

237
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,433
Shinbo said handling these
Persocoms would be easy.

238
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,333
Mobile units must be lighter.

239
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,233
It's amazing!

240
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,300
She's really no different
looking than a human girl.

241
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,366
She's pretty, too.

242
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,833
And soft.

243
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,433
Maybe that's just because
she's still brand new?

244
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,900
Or maybe she was thrown away

245
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,800
because a new model came out?

246
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,800
What a waste of money!

247
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,466
I wouldn't throw her away
for something like that.

248
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,933
Well let's see what it can do!

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,366
I wonder how you turn it on.

250
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:53,400
Shinbo said that they start up

251
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:54,533
when you push the switch.

252
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,833
Switch... Switch... Switch...

253
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,800
Switch... Switch...

254
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,066
Where's it at?

255
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,333
Oh man.

256
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,200
I can't find that darn switch.

257
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,966
I've already tried pushing
every place I can think of.

258
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,566
I pushed here, and there.

259
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:13,833
And this, and even these!
Even those.

260
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,233
I've pushed every inch of
this computer I can find!

261
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,433
Everywhere! Except...

262
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,900
It can't be...

263
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:26,066
No. Not there?!

264
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:28,933
Impossible!

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,066
How can that possibly
be the switch!

266
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:33,533
But that's really the only
place I haven't tried yet.

267
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,466
I'm not doing this

268
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,266
because I'm
perverted or anything.

269
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,500
But what's the point of having

270
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:49,400
it if it doesn't work?!

271
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:52,466
Yeah! That's right.

272
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,000
Right.

273
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,233
Chi?

274
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,233
Wha?! Uh... Chi? Eh... Huh?

275
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,400
Chi?

276
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,433
Chi? What's that?

277
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,200
Oh! I get it. Is that your name?

278
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,366
Chi!!

279
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:40,400
Wait a minute!
What's going on here?!

280
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:42,300
The Persocom has started moving,

281
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,433
but it only says "Chi".

282
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,366
And it's naked, and on top
of that it's really cute.

283
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,333
Chi?

284
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,433
I know!

285
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,300
I've heard of something
like this happening before.

286
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,266
A beautiful girl barges into
your life outta nowhere,

287
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,533
who happens to
have special powers,

288
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,766
and can do almost anything!

289
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,333
Suddenly she falls in love

290
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,566
with the guy she lives with,

291
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,466
and she'll do all
sorts of things for him!

292
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:08,100
Cooking, cleaning,
even THOSE kinda things!

293
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,400
Chi?

294
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,466
Thank you! I am SO lucky!

295
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,133
Y-Yeah!

296
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,133
It's me, Shinbo,

297
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,566
I'm just goin' out to
the public bathhouse.

298
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,633
I was wondering if you
wanted to come along.

299
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,133
This apartment doesn't
have any bathtubs.

300
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,433
Okay, that sounds good!

301
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,466
Are you ready to go now?

302
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:26,700
I'll be right there.

303
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,766
Uh, naked!

304
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,133
Of course, what's the
big deal? It's a bath.

305
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,300
Don't tell me you're
the type that has

306
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,533
to wear a bathing suit
in a public bath.

307
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,233
Chi...

308
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,266
No of course not. No problem!

309
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,533
Oh no what am I gonna
do? This is not good!

310
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
Shhh.

311
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,400
Okay clothes, clothes,
where are the clothes?

312
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,400
I've got to find
something for her to wear!

313
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,466
Oh man!

314
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,733
I should have
labeled these boxes

315
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
so I'd know what's inside!

316
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,233
Yes! A towel!
This'll work for now.

317
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,233
Chi...

318
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,633
That looks even more suspicious.

319
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,366
Hey, are you ready or not?!

320
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,233
There has got to be
something for her to wear!

321
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,433
Come on!

322
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,733
Unh...

323
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,100
No not that!!

324
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,033
What's wrong?

325
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,633
Can't you find your
stuff for the bath?

326
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,200
No! That's not it...

327
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,500
You want some help?

328
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:12,800
No, I'm fine!!

329
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,733
Don't be so embarrassed.

330
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,066
Hey, the door's unlocked.

331
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,466
Ah!!! I forgot
to lock the door!!

332
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,200
I've got to hide
her somewhere! Nice!

333
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,133
What's the matter?
Hey, what happened?

334
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,833
Your room is trashed!
Hey, relax man.

335
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,066
The bath's open
till midnight, ya know.

336
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,633
What's wrong?
Your nose is bleeding!

337
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,533
I'm fine, really.

338
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,333
It's no big deal. I just fell!

339
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
Okay, but I don't
know how you're gonna

340
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,766
find your shampoo or anything.

341
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,166
I guess you can use mine.

342
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,500
Uh, thanks.

343
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:44,500
You need a towel?

344
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,733
Got one right here.

345
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,366
But I mean I was already kinda,
uh, using it for something.

346
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,400
For what?

347
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:51,866
Um! Nothing to worry about.

348
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,400
It doesn't concern you at all!

349
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:55,333
Yeah, whatever.

350
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,833
I'll be waiting in my room, so
come by when you're ready.

351
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,600
Great! No problem!
I'll be there in a sec!

352
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,133
See ya.

353
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,166
Chi?

354
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,900
Hey...

355
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,233
Yeah?

356
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,833
Now what're you doing?

357
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,500
Oh nothing I guess
I just tripped again.

358
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,866
Is something wrong with you?

359
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:17,433
Chi?

360
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,300
No! No, nothing at all!

361
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,366
Well look, if you can't find

362
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,400
a change of clothes,
you can borrow some of mine.

363
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:23,133
Chi?

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,166
That's all right.

365
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,566
I can find some
of my own clothes!

366
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:26,633
I'll be over there in a second

367
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,200
so just wait for
me in your room.

368
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,533
Okay? Okay?

369
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,166
Yeah. Okay.

370
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:40,600
Oh by the way...

371
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,500
What?!

372
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,566
Chill out!
Don't surprise me like that!

373
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,466
Sorry dude.
What'd you wanna say?

374
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh, yeah.
The bath costs 400 yen.

375
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,900
If you wanna use the sauna
and stuff, it's an extra 300.

376
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,300
Do you have enough?

377
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,333
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

378
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:00,700
Chi.

379
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:07,866
I'm so tired.

380
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,400
Chi.

381
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:10,833
Huh?!

382
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,566
You stay right here. Okay? Okay?

383
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:18,866
Chi.

384
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,700
What now, Shinbo? Cut it out.

385
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,800
Huh?!! M-Miss Hibiya!

386
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,466
Um, hi! So what
can I do for you?

387
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,333
I'm afraid I made
too much kinpira.

388
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,700
If you don't dislike
this kind of food.

389
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,633
Wow, that looks great!
Is that for me?!

390
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,533
Yes.

391
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,300
Ah! Thank you so much!

392
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:37,800
Oh, it's no problem

393
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,600
since I made too
much for just me.

394
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,766
I hope you don't mind.

395
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,433
Why would I mind?

396
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,833
I'm thrilled! This is great!

397
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,733
It's totally fine with me!

398
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,966
Oh, I'm so glad.

399
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,966
Well, if I make anything
else I think is good,

400
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,700
I'll be sure to
bring it up for you.

401
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:51,233
Wow! You will?!

402
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,233
Sure! If you're happy
with my cooking.

403
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,866
Yeah! I'll be happy alright!

404
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,200
Thank you very much!

405
00:19:59,033 --> 00:19:59,800
Chi.

406
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,833
You're really too nice.

407
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,733
Chi.

408
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,566
I'm touched!

409
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:03,600
Chi.

410
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,400
You're the best!

411
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:05,966
Oh!

412
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,300
Huh? Waaahhh!!

413
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,300
Chi?

414
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:10,433
My oh my.

415
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,833
No really, it's not
what you think!

416
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,466
It's a Persocom!

417
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:16,000
My! What a cute little Persocom!

418
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,833
Yeah, well, it's a
Persocom all right.

419
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,266
Well Mr. Motosuwa
and Miss Persocom.

420
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,833
Have a very good night.

421
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,466
Chi.

422
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,366
Wow. What a cool manager.

423
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,966
I bet she thinks I'm
a pervert or something.

424
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,266
She probably thinks

425
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm stripping my
Persocom just for fun.

426
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,666
Mmm, this is good.

427
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,500
What?

428
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:43,633
Now you're not
gonna come with me?

429
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,466
Why not?

430
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,666
Hey, sorry man.

431
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:46,700
I just feel like I should finish

432
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,666
cleaning up my
place, that's all.

433
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,666
Well, alright then,
what can I say?

434
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm so sorry!

435
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:55,300
It's fine. Chill out.
Don't worry about it.

436
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,833
Chi.

437
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,333
Very nice!

438
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,333
Chi.

439
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Why am I sweating so much?

440
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,766
I'm just dealing
with a Persocom here!

441
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,466
I know I need to
calm down. That's it.

442
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:11,666
I'll just calm down, calm down!

443
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,800
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

444
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,833
Chi.

445
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,733
Hey.

446
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,066
Chi?

447
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,400
Is "Chi" the only
thing you can say?

448
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:21,200
Chi.

449
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:22,866
Well, I guess this
was a Persocom

450
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,933
that I found out in the garbage.

451
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,433
Hmm, I wonder if it's broken

452
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,566
or messed up or something.

453
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,500
Hey, don't look so sad.

454
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:51,400
Are you afraid

455
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:54,066
that you're gonna be
thrown away again?

456
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,700
C'mon, I'm the
one who rescued you!

457
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,433
I'll take good care of you!

458
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,500
Chi!

459
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,033
She really is cute, though.

460
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,900
So soft. So warm.

461
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,533
If she didn't have those ears,

462
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,566
she'd be just
like a normal girl.

463
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,533
And her breasts are so soft too!

464
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,100
How lucky am I to find
such a cute Persocom?

465
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,166
Yes!

466
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,833
Chi, Chi!

467
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,800
But all she ever says is "Chi."

468
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,866
I wonder if she's
broken or something.

469
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,133
I really don't know
anything about these things.

470
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,666
 Chi.

471
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,000
But don't worry!

472
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,600
I'm gonna find out
what's wrong with her

473
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,066
when I talk to this guy
that Shinbo introduces me to.

474
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,533
Apparently he's knows
everything about Persocoms!

475
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Chi!

476
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:28,766
The next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Goes Out." Huh?

477
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,600
An urban legend
circulating the 'net?
