1
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,466
I just don't get it at all.

2
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:09,600
Unh! What's the matter with me?!

3
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,066
This'll take forever;
I'll never make it!

4
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,366
Huh?

5
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,200
Senpai!

6
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,533
Yumi?

7
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,433
Uh, Yumi.

8
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
What's this all about?

9
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,300
Senpai.

10
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,933
Gah!

11
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:45,900
M-Miss Manager!

12
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,833
What on earth
are you doing here?

13
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,833
Huh?

14
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,966
Ahh.

15
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:55,433
But, what the heck has
suddenly come over all of you?

16
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,866
Ooh.

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,933
Mmm.

18
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,466
Do me.

19
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,800
Do?

20
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,400
W-What on earth's going on?

21
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:17,033
Are you the one who is
for me, and only for me?

22
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,800
Or are you not the
one who is for me.

23
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,333
Which is it?

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,533
Tell me.

25
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,400
Which?

26
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,933
Hideki...

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,866
Hideki.

28
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,466
Huh?

29
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,533
Hideki.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,966
You were saying uhh, uhh,
and going round and round.

31
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,466
Is Hideki alright?

32
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,733
Round and round?

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,866
I guess I was moaning
from that nightmare.

34
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,966
That nightmare?

35
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,233
Well, it's... Hmm.

36
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
Well, it means to
have a scary dream,

37
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,533
and thrash around, like
I must've been doing just now.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,566
Hideki was scared?

39
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,866
Huh? Oh, don't worry; I'm fine.

40
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,000
I said it was scary,
but it's just a dream.

41
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,333
Dream?

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,966
Chi doesn't understand
about "dream."

43
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,266
Oh, I guess you probably
wouldn't have dreams,

44
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,633
because you're a Persocom.

45
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,033
But it's no big deal.

46
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,000
Dreams aren't actually
real, after all.

47
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:16,433
See? I'm full of energy!

48
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Energy?

49
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:18,800
Huh?

50
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,433
Full of energy here, too?

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,800
Gah!

52
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:22,666
Chi.

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,500
Geez, what a great morning
this turned out to be.

54
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,533
And that was such
a strange dream, too.

55
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Do me, Hideki.

56
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,433
That was so nice.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,066
Can't think about that right now

58
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,100
Let's see, anything else?

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Wallet, right. Gotta have that.

60
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,500
What is Hideki doing?

61
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:04,866
No matter how many times I look,

62
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,633
there's never any money inside.

63
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,000
Money?

64
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,500
Is that a good thing to have?

65
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:11,766
Of course it is.

66
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,333
Hey, you can get just
about anything you want

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,666
if you've got enough money.

68
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,433
Study books, clothing,
food, whatever you need.

69
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,233
But there's only
so much you can do,

70
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,333
and right now I couldn't
take on another job

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,733
even if I wanted to.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Another job?

73
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah, it means to work.

74
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,066
When you go out and do that,
they give you money.

75
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,400
I pretty much have
to buy the study guides.

76
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,766
I guess I'll just cut
back to one meal a day.

77
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,100
As for the porno mags...

78
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,766
Hmmm.

79
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,000
I guess I can borrow
them from my boss.

80
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,233
Chi will get a job.

81
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,133
Huh?

82
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,266
Can Chi do this job?

83
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,466
"Would you like to
make 2 million a month?"

84
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,333
"Dominatrix wanted."

85
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,966
No way!

86
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,266
Ch-

87
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,033
Chi can't get job?

88
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,933
Huh?

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,633
Uh, no, no it's not like that.

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,766
Hey, I didn't mean you can't
get a job if you want to,

91
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,033
it's-yeah, it's just
the problem is:

92
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,500
what kind of job,
that's all I meant.

93
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,766
So then, Chi can get a job.

94
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,766
Huh?

95
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,933
Hmm.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,433
Well, if it's a good job.

97
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,766
Yes, Chi will do a good job!

98
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,200
What's the use?

99
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,433
But any shady jobs are
completely off limits.

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,566
We can talk about
it when I get back.

101
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,233
Okay, well I have to go now.

102
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,966
Take care of yourself.

103
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,633
Good, good; shady, bad.

104
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,133
Shady jobs bad;
good jobs, good. Chi learned.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,300
Chi gets good job.
Hideki is happy.

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,900
Work, prep school,
work, prep school...

107
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,900
It's the same ol' thing,
day in and day out.

108
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,133
This starving student
thing is tough.

109
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,133
Chi really wants a job, huh?

110
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,433
No, it's impossible, isn't it?

111
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,033
What's impossible?

112
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,733
Ahh! Oh,Yumi.

113
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Huh? Not working today?

114
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,400
Nope, I'm going to
go shopping right now.

115
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:46,300
Can I give you a hand
carrying that, Senpai?

116
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,366
Ahh.

117
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,466
Yumi!

118
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,566
Gah!

119
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,766
What's wrong?

120
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,766
Well, it's heavy.

121
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,933
Oh, is it?

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,333
By the way,
Senpai, what was that

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,566
you were saying about a job?

124
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,266
Huh?! How'd you
know about that?!

125
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,400
Because I overheard you saying

126
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,366
something about it just now.

127
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,700
I was just doing it again.

128
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,366
You're not going
to quit, are you?

129
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,366
Huh?

130
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,300
You're not saying
you've found another job,

131
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,966
and you're going to
be leaving us, are you?

132
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,400
Oh no, I didn't mean that,
I didn't say that at all!

133
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,266
I'm not going to quit.
I couldn't; if I quit my job,

134
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,266
I wouldn't be able to survive!

135
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,400
I'm so glad!

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,733
"I'm so glad!"
"I'm so glad!" "I'm so glad!"

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,866
Ohh! Yumi's smile... It's so-

138
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,266
Wait a minute,
that look on her face...

139
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,033
That's definitely one
of those looks like

140
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,766
she's really worried
I might quit my job.

141
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,166
Wait a sec. Could it be?

142
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,500
Could it be?

143
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,800
Then what were you
so worked up about?

144
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,666
Oh, it was about Chi.

145
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,633
Chi?

146
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,866
Yeah.

147
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,666
Oh, that's right; that was your
Persocom's name, wasn't it?

148
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:01,266
Yeah she suddenly started
talking about getting a job.

149
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm a little bit
worried about it.

150
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,033
Persocom.

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,733
I'm sure your Persocom
is a very cute one, too.

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,300
Huh?

153
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,733
Yumi? Ugh!

154
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,900
What's the matter with me?!

155
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm even more of
a geek than usual.

156
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,766
What is it, Senpai?
Are you hungry?

157
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,733
No, things are just
a little tight this month,

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
I had to cut back on food.

159
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:22,833
I mean, hey, it's nothing!

160
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,966
Well, gotta go get
ready to open up!

161
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,400
Get good job... None.

162
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,700
Hey, there!

163
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:44,833
Whatcha doin'?

164
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,866
Huh?

165
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,466
Hey, wait, it's a Persocom.

166
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,300
But I gotta say she's
an awfully cute one.

167
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:51,633
So, who's your owner?

168
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
Why ya out alone?

169
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,166
My owner is called Hideki.

170
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,300
Chi, looking for a job.

171
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,700
A job?

172
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,833
Oh, hey what a coincidence...

173
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,533
I know one: it's a
really good job too;

174
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
really short hours,
and great pay.

175
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,166
A good job?

176
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,266
Oh yeah, a really good job!

177
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,966
I'll tell ya all
about it, come on.

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,333
It's a little ways away
from here, but don't worry.

179
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,533
I'll take you over to the place.

180
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
You'll like it.
The work's really easy.

181
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:23,900
I have an order
for two lemon sours!

182
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,200
My Pleasure!

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,066
But I can't stop now; I gotta
get these finished first.

184
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:32,700
Are these glasses
ready for me to take now?

185
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,133
Uh, sure.

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,433
Good, then, please excuse me.

187
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,366
Boy, these new
Persocoms really are

188
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,966
something when
you think about it.

189
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,366
They notice things,
and they seem

190
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,233
to be able to do
just about anything.

191
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,333
But.

192
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
I don't think it'd be
quite the same way with Chi.

193
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:53,800
Senpai.

194
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,633
Hey Yumi, what's up?

195
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,100
It's just about the end
of your shift, isn't it?

196
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,366
Would you like
to have some dinner

197
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,466
with me before you go?

198
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,900
Huh? Me?

199
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,400
It sounded like you might
be a little bit hungry today,

200
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,200
so I just happened to buy a
little more food than I needed.

201
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,533
It's not very good for your body

202
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
to cut back on food, you know.

203
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,966
And anyway, you can't study
if you don't have energy.

204
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,266
So I'm gonna have dinner now,

205
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,900
and if you don't
have any objection...

206
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,866
Yumi's homemade dinner.

207
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:23,166
Okay, say "aah!"

208
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,566
Aah!

209
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,766
Oh, but...

210
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,733
Actually, if you've got a
Persocom back at your apartment,

211
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,533
it's probably busy making dinner
for you right now, isn't it?

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,666
No.

213
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,600
It's not like there are

214
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,566
that many things
Chi can do right yet.

215
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:37,766
That's why I was concerned
about her getting a job.

216
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,933
I was afraid she might wind up

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,633
in a dangerous situation
or something like that.

218
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,333
Are you really
worried about her?

219
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,333
Oh yeah, more than just worried.

220
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,033
Hey, I'm not even really sure
exactly what she can do.

221
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,833
Oh, she'll be alright.

222
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,700
A Persocom can do
pretty much anything,

223
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:55,033
and just about any job.

224
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,366
Uh , Yumi?

225
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,833
So, you are going
to eat dinner, aren't you?

226
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,966
Oh, sure.

227
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,466
Great, well I'll
be up in the office.

228
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,100
Yumi always seems
to get so depressed

229
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,466
whenever we talk
about Persocoms.

230
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,300
Did she have a bad experience
with one or something?

231
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,300
Hmm.

232
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,000
I should watch what
I say around her.

233
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:26,833
Now, try talking.

234
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,966
Yes.

235
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,733
The Kanto area tomorrow
will be partially cloudy,

236
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,066
and in some areas,
low-lying fog may develop.

237
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:33,866
That's fine.

238
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:35,266
Conversation good.

239
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,300
Now, I just need
to check the CPU-

240
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,566
Is something wrong?

241
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,966
It's something about Chi.

242
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,166
I did a search for this
on the net a while back.

243
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,233
Apparently I got a hit.

244
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,466
Yuzuki, switch over.

245
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,766
Right.

246
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:53,433
Huh?

247
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,700
What ?

248
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,466
What's going on?

249
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,100
You are a cute one, aren't you?

250
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,166
Okay, now don't
let it bother you any,

251
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,766
nobody can hear
me except for you.

252
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm gonna start streaming
the feed onto the web now,

253
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,366
and depending on
how many hits you get,

254
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,033
you might even make
more than we said.

255
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,466
So knock 'em dead.

256
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,733
Chi?

257
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I thought
I'd seen them all,

258
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,666
and I gotta say I've checked out
a bunch of Persocoms in my day,

259
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,600
but I've never seen anyone
nearly as cute as this one.

260
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,533
Hey, what brand are you?

261
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,033
Brand?

262
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,500
Hmm. It must be custom-made.

263
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,433
Alright, so who made you, then?

264
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,266
Chi has no idea
what person made Chi.

265
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,900
Huh? Your owner,
this Hideki guy?

266
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,133
He wasn't the one who made you?

267
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,633
Hideki found Chi.

268
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,900
But Hideki didn't make Chi.

269
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:01,966
He found you?!

270
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,066
Huh?

271
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,733
So this Hideki somehow managed

272
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,133
to get a Persocom
like you for free?

273
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,666
Talk about lucky.

274
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:09,766
Lucky?

275
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,766
I mean, he should be happy.

276
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,166
Should be happy.

277
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:18,333
Happy. Is that good for Hideki?

278
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,866
Oh yeah, people are better
off when they're happy.

279
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,000
Happy.

280
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:33,433
Hideki's happy.
Happy to find Chi.

281
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:44,800
The physical appearance
matches perfectly.

282
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:46,400
There's no room for doubt.

283
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:48,166
It's definitely Chi

284
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,333
But I'm quite sure
Mr. Motosuwa would

285
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
never make Chi work
in a place like this one.

286
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:56,366
Yuzuki, send
Mr. Shinbo an e-mail.

287
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,533
Right.

288
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,366
You have mail! You have mail!

289
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,366
Huh?

290
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,166
Mail? Who's it from?

291
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:12,666
From Mr. Minoru Kokubunji,
and it's marked "urgent"!

292
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,900
Urgent? Read it, would ya?

293
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,200
Aye!

294
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,966
I didn't mean to spring
it on you so suddenly,

295
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:21,066
it's just that my whole family
seems to be eating out today.

296
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:24,466
And I don't know about you,
but I don't like eating alone.

297
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,633
I'm really glad you
could stay, Senpai.

298
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,533
"I'm really glad you
could stay, Senpai."

299
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,400
"I'm really glad you
could stay, Senpai."

300
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,100
"I'm really glad, Senpai."

301
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,166
I'm such a lucky guy!

302
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,233
I'll make dinner right away,

303
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,866
so it'll be just a minute, okay?

304
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:40,100
Oh, don't worry
about me, I'm fine.

305
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,600
You don't have to hurry.

306
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,266
Wow, you're pretty
good with that thing.

307
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,900
I guess you do a
lotta cooking, huh?

308
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,500
Well, I wouldn't say that.

309
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:51,033
I do bake a lot of
sweets, though, but...

310
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know how good a
cook I am for regular food,

311
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,400
so if it's bad, you don't
have to finish it or anything.

312
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,800
Oh, that's all right.

313
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:01,100
If it's something you make,
Yumi, I'm sure I'll eat it all.

314
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,866
Uh-oh, now you've done it!

315
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,200
That was a promise!

316
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,366
Wah-hooo!

317
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,333
Ooops!

318
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,333
Hey, what's the matter?

319
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,500
Oh, it's nothing.

320
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,633
I just dropped the lid for
the salt shaker, that's all.

321
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,866
Oh I see.

322
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,900
Do you need any help?

323
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,066
Sure, how about
giving this a taste?

324
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,166
So, what do you think?

325
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,466
Delicious!
You're a great cook, Yumi!

326
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,066
You really think so?
That's great!

327
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,400
Senpai, so tell me,
how do you like your eggs?

328
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you prefer them sweet or not?

329
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,433
Hmm. Not too sweet.

330
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,866
My pleasure!

331
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
Hey, this is sorta fun,
don'tcha think?

332
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:38,533
It's almost like
we're newlyweds.

333
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,366
Gah?!

334
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,800
Oh, but if we were married,

335
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,833
that would make me a little
too young, wouldn't it?

336
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,633
No, hey, that's not true at all!

337
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,633
In fact, I really like
the Young Wife series!

338
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,400
Wife series?

339
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,700
Argh.

340
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,333
Uh, I...

341
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,733
How could I have said that?

342
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Motosuwa!

343
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,200
There's someone here to see you!

344
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,433
Motosuwa!

345
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,266
Shinbo?

346
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,400
What's the matter, Shinbo?

347
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,933
I've never seen you
so worked up.

348
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,266
Okay, well it's like this:
are you making

349
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,800
your Persocom work or something?

350
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,666
Huh? Not really.

351
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,666
That's what I thought.

352
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,166
I just got an
e-mail from Kokubunji.

353
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,200
Sumomo!

354
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,500
Aye!Replaying message!

355
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,900
Chi is in a peep show.

356
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:20,633
They're also doing
streaming video,

357
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,566
and it's called: "Kitty-cat's
live hot girls meow meow."

358
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:28,066
In a... peep... show?

359
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,900
You mean a peep show?

360
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,600
How'd that happen?!

361
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,566
Chi doesn't understand
much about the world,

362
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,300
and she doesn't
have any common sense!

363
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:36,800
If something
happened to her, I'd-

364
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,633
That's-That's why I tried
to teach her about things!

365
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,800
What have I done?

366
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,100
Money?

367
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,666
Is that a good thing to have?

368
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,666
Impossible!

369
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,033
You gotta tell me
where this place is.

370
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Tell me right now!

371
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,933
Hey calm down, willya?

372
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Sumomo's already got the address
of the place, so don't worry.

373
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:55,933
She can help you find it.

374
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,866
Where is it?!

375
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:57,600
Waah!

376
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,733
Master, he's scary!

377
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:01,166
Ugh.

378
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:02,433
Come on, we're counting on you.

379
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Aye. Then I will start
my navigation mode now.

380
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:09,433
Now proceed straight this way.

381
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,466
And turn left, turn left!

382
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,933
You have strayed
from the guide route!

383
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,266
Alrighty then.
It's just about show time.

384
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,766
You about ready in there?

385
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,366
Then, let's get to it.

386
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,933
What is Chi supposed to do?

387
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,633
Well, you should strip
your clothes off bit by bit.

388
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Chi strip?

389
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,933
Make sure you give a
good show for the customers,

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,766
lots of sexy poses like this,
you know what I mean?

391
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,100
The customers?

392
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,733
Yeah. See all the holes
in the wall around you?

393
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,100
They're lookin' in
from there, get it?

394
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,266
Hey, what are you doin'?

395
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,300
Gyah!

396
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,500
Hey, don't do that!
Get back in your chair!

397
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,166
Chi?

398
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,666
Continue straight ahead!

399
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,966
Turn right at the next alley!

400
00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:02,266
Okay, now let's try
the top, alright?

401
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,133
That's good, lower it slowly.

402
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,166
Right, now it's
time for your bra.

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,066
Hey whatcha doin'?

404
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,100
Don't tell me you don't
know how to take off your bra!

405
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,700
Chi never had a bra before.

406
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,333
She's never put on a bra?

407
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,733
That Hideki must be
some kinda puritan.

408
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,733
Oh, alright.

409
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,700
That's fine;
go for the underpants.

410
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:32,533
Underpants. Underpants.

411
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,766
Underpants.

412
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,066
Okay, that'll do.
You can drop them now.

413
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,900
Okay, what say we spice things
up a little with the fingers?

414
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:43,733
Fingers?

415
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,266
Yeah, put your fingers in.

416
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,833
Chi?

417
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,233
No no no!
Not in there, not in there!

418
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,866
Fingers in where?

419
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,000
In between your legs.

420
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,866
Chi.

421
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,133
Stop.

422
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Is something wrong?

423
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,566
Stop?

424
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,500
Don't touch there.

425
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,366
Don't.

426
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:12,966
Touch.

427
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,733
There.

428
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:23,833
Take the next left turn here!

429
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,400
You idiot!

430
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,633
Sorry 'bout that!

431
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,000
Chi!

432
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:41,066
Hey, what's the
matter? Hey? Hello!

433
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,666
Well that's about it.

434
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,433
Remember this well.

435
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,433
You rebooted by pushing the
switch deep inside there.

436
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,300
And so, regardless
of what happens,

437
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,933
until the day someone
who truly loves you appears,

438
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,233
never let anyone touch you here.

439
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,300
Nobody.

440
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:17,366
That's right.

441
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:20,433
Don't let anyone
touch you. Anyone.

442
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,233
The building is
300 meters ahead.

443
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,566
Your destination
is the 7th floor!

444
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,900
There it is!

445
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:54,033
Come on, what's the
matter all of a sudden?

446
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,366
Didn't you understand
what I said?

447
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,766
It's simple, you know?

448
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,133
Let's give it a try.

449
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,433
Stop.

450
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,300
Are you running some
kinda special program,

451
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,566
is that what it means?

452
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,500
Come on, Hideki.

453
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:08,600
I guess I have to...

454
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,200
Here.

455
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,933
Like this.

456
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,333
W-What's that?

457
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:19,700
Chi!

458
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,666
Chi!

459
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:03,800
Ta-dah!

460
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,900
Now, which of the
following is a shady job?

461
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:06,900
Chi chi chi chi chi...

462
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:08,500
Convenience store clerk,
leaflet passer-outer,

463
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,100
dishwasher, manga drawing
assistant, traffic consultant,

464
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,466
waitress, paperboy, anime
producer, construction worker,

465
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,933
tutor, phone operator,
bartender, roadie, movie extra,

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,533
model, peep show stripper.

467
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,833
And the answer is:

468
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,933
it would have to be the
peep show stripper, right?

469
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,900
So, how in the world did you end
up there? Chi!

470
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,733
The next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Bewildered."

471
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,600
Chi found a good job
just like Hideki said.
