1
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,866
Welcome, come on in!

2
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,333
Right this way, please.

3
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,500
Here ya go: two beers!

4
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,233
Okay, order up over here!

5
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,866
Why was Yumi out
there that night?

6
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,300
She seemed to
know Mr. Ueda, too.

7
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,000
What was that all about?

8
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,066
Excuse me!

9
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,066
I'd like to order now,
if you don't mind.

10
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:17,733
Hello?

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,300
Oh, yes. It's my pleasure!

12
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,333
Here ya go.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,333
Also, some yakitori
and a plate of sashimi.

14
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,466
Oh, right! It's my pleasure!

15
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,866
Hm, still not here.

16
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,000
I wonder what's going
on with Miss Hibiya.

17
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,433
I'm back!

18
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,166
Welcome back!

19
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,866
Welcome back, Hideki.

20
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,000
Welcome back.

21
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:56,966
Hey, everybody.

22
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,566
Thanks for taking
care of the place.

23
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,800
When you hear the
sound of the stomach,

24
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,866
it means it's time to eat!

25
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,133
No, not now.

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Tonight, I think it's more
important that I study.

27
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,666
Do you mean to
say that you intend

28
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,666
to skip a meal, even
though you're hungry?

29
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,833
So what you really mean is

30
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,800
you don't have any money.

31
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,700
Now how did I know that?

32
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,600
Hideki's money is gone?

33
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,700
Then Chi will cook again
using her money from Tirol!

34
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,900
Chi wants to see Hideki smile.

35
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:32,900
Chi.

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,366
Chi?

37
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,100
Yeah, so I found this
really great place.

38
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,200
Really?

39
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,833
Yeah, I'm sure you're
gonna love this restaurant.

40
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
It's got nice atmosphere,
and of course,

41
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,966
the food's incredible.

42
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,466
That sounds great; I'm starved!

43
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,833
So what kind of food is it?

44
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Oh, it's a combination
of Russian and...

45
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,200
Chi? What's the matter?

46
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:05,400
Hideki why are those people
shaking hands like that?

47
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, they're not shaking hands.

48
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,600
They're holding hands.

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,500
Why do they hold hands?

50
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,233
Oh, well, because they like it,

51
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,566
and they feel happy
when they do it.

52
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:16,366
Happy?

53
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,566
So you can feel happy

54
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,666
if you hold hands with someone?

55
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,700
Well not just with anyone.

56
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,500
You see, it only works
with somebody you love.

57
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,533
Happy holding hands.

58
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,166
Here we are.

59
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,366
Let's go in.

60
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,200
Hello there!

61
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,933
Anybody here?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,666
Anybody here?

63
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,633
Huh, that's weird.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,600
I wonder why
there's nobody around.

65
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,866
Are you back there? Mr. Ueda?

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,566
Oh, there you are.

67
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:12,766
Uh? Wha...? Oh, Motosuwa.

68
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,366
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,266
I guess I must've surprised you.

70
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,233
No, not at all.

71
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,600
I was just sort of
spacing out, I guess.

72
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,166
Please let Chi help!

73
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,166
Chi came here to work, Manager.

74
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh, thank you very much, Chi.

75
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,000
Then you'd better
go into the other room

76
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,866
and get changed
as soon as possible.

77
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,033
Chi!

78
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:39,300
So uh, is something
wrong, Mr. Ueda?

79
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,300
Huh?

80
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:43,066
Well, I have to admit
you look a bit run down.

81
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,866
Chi?

82
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:46,433
Thanks.

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
But I'm fine, Motosuwa.

84
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:50,033
You know, I'm really
lucky to have Chi

85
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,900
to help out around here;
she's a very good worker.

86
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,900
Then, I guess everything's fine.

87
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,700
But listen.

88
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,566
If there is ever anything
you need help with,

89
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,133
you know where
to find me, right?

90
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,500
Motosuwa.

91
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:04,433
I was a total wreck
after Chi disappeared,

92
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,166
and you were there for me.

93
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,433
I felt so much better
after talking to you.

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
So, I'd like to do the same

95
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,366
if you need someone to talk to.

96
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,533
But don't take it the wrong way!

97
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,866
It's not just to pay
you back, of course.

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,900
I really appreciate it.

99
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,900
But I'm serious: there's nothing
the matter with me at all.

100
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,300
I just tend to be a
little awkward sometimes.

101
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,633
Huh?

102
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,166
I always want to see
a smile on the face

103
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,966
of the one I care about
the most in this world.

104
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,900
But somehow or other,

105
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,833
they always seem
to end up crying.

106
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,933
Mr. Ueda...

107
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,066
Chi changed!

108
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,966
Chi?

109
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,833
Ch-ch-ch-Chi , that outfit!

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,966
Um, Chi, that-that's
not the right one.

111
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:54,800
Huh?

112
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,166
This is wrong?

113
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,433
Yes Chi, I'm afraid
that's the wrong uniform;

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,333
that was made for someone else,

115
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,766
but I just couldn't bring
myself to get rid of it.

116
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,566
Huh?

117
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,400
Did Chi make a mistake?

118
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,166
Oh no, I'm the one
who made the mistake;

119
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,600
I should never have left it out.

120
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,033
I'm sorry about that, Chi.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,633
Why don't you come with me, Chi,

122
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,466
I've got your uniform over here.

123
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,033
Yumi!

124
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,533
Huh?

125
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm sorry, can you watch
Chi for me, please?!

126
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,100
Motosuwa, you shouldn't...

127
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,033
Yumi!

128
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:03,600
Yumi!

129
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,733
There's one thing I'm good at,

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,733
and it happens
to be running fast.

131
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,800
Y-Yumi?

132
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,266
So are Persocoms really
the best after all?

133
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,300
They're better than
real women, aren't they?!

134
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,466
Better than any woman, anywhere!

135
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,100
He told me he made
that outfit just for me.

136
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,700
But n-now a Persocom's...

137
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:31,400
Huh?

138
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,500
So does this mean the new dress

139
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:35,766
that Chi put on was actually
meant for you to wear?

140
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:43,433
Does it hurt?

141
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,700
Huh?

142
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:47,433
Do you hurt right here?
Is it an injury?

143
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
I'm not injured, Chi,
but thanks a lot.

144
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,166
But Chi doesn't understand.

145
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,400
Manager had a painful face.

146
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,033
It's still there.

147
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,433
Why does it always come to this?

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,900
I just made her cry again.

149
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,633
Not only that, I hesitated

150
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,566
when I should
have gone after her.

151
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,533
But Manager, it's different.

152
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,900
Yumi cried because
of Chi this time.

153
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,433
When she looked at Chi.

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,733
No, it's my fault.

155
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,433
Her goodbye was perfectly
clear last time.

156
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,433
Goodbye?

157
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,266
But no matter what I do,

158
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,033
somehow I just can't
seem to get over her.

159
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,566
Telephone!

160
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,833
Telephone! Telephone!

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,233
No answer.

162
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,133
Switching from telephone
to voice mail mode now!

163
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,300
Recording completed,
recording completed!

164
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,966
Hm...

165
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,066
May I help you?

166
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,266
Where's my applause?

167
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,233
Huh?

168
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,266
An ovation!

169
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,066
Sumomo has just done a fine job!

170
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,433
There should be applause!

171
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,233
Why do I even bother?

172
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,300
So what about my applause?

173
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,633
Yay! Woohoo!

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,433
Sumomo got applause!
I got applause!

175
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,033
What is it with
this place anyway?

176
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,100
All the Persocoms around here
are so strange, including Chi.

177
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,533
Hey! They're back!

178
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,933
Welcome back!

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Is this person a guest of yours?

180
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:37,333
Yeah. So can you guys
keep it down for a while?

181
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,833
Aye!

182
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,966
Goodbye means, you can't
stay by their side anymore.

183
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,000
You won't see them anymore.

184
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,033
Goodbye is...
Goodbye is very hard.

185
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,566
Oh, Chi.

186
00:10:56,633 --> 00:11:00,233
Manager feels the hurt
because of the goodbye.

187
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,500
So, was it Yumi who said
the goodbye to Manger?

188
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,500
Yes.

189
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,266
Does it hurt right
here no matter

190
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,433
who says the goodbye?

191
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,633
Do all goodbyes
feel the same way?

192
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,400
Well, it's true
that you feel lonely

193
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,966
whether you're the one
who says goodbye or they do.

194
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,000
But it's- it's the
goodbye that comes

195
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,866
from the one you
love the most...

196
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,433
that's the one that ends
up hurting you the most.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,166
Well, you see,
I used to work at Tirol.

198
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,633
Mr. Ueda is a very nice person.

199
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,966
When he wasn't busy,
he'd even teach me

200
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:35,133
how to bake cakes
and cookies and things.

201
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,766
It's amazing what a sweet

202
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,700
and wonderful guy he can be.

203
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:46,233
He blushes easily,
and he's really cute too.

204
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,766
And so...

205
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,433
Well, I fell in love.

206
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,666
And one day, I summoned
up all my courage,

207
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,100
and asked him out.

208
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,633
I love you.

209
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,266
Uh, I uh, love you, too.

210
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,833
R-Really?

211
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,600
Y-Yes.

212
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,000
Really for real?

213
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,866
R-Really, for real.

214
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,566
I had that outfit made
just for you, Yumi.

215
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,200
Well, I thought it would be nice

216
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,066
if you could keep working here,

217
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:29,066
but, do you think
this is a good idea?

218
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,866
I mean, I'm a lot older
than you are, Yumi.

219
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:36,200
And, not only that,
but I was married before.

220
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,933
You were married?!

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes, but my wife passed away.

222
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,633
Is that a problem for you?

223
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,766
N-No, that doesn't
matter one bit.

224
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,566
But, it sort of
stuck in my mind,

225
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,533
and I got curious
about what kind of person

226
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,166
he'd been married to.

227
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,733
So, without telling him,

228
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,200
I used a Persocom
and did a secret search.

229
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:05,100
Senpai, I was
wondering if you'd mind

230
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,400
doing a web search
for me right now.

231
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,366
Huh? Oh, no problem.

232
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,700
Can you do that, Sumomo?

233
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:13,066
Aye! Please give
me the keywords!

234
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,600
The terms I'd like you to look

235
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:19,766
for are "Hiryoyasu Ueda" "cake"
and "Tirol" and "marriage."

236
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,600
158 entries have been found.

237
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,366
How many of those are news
sites with video files?

238
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,600
There are two of them.

239
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,300
Um, I'd like to
show them on the TV.

240
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:31,433
Do you mind?

241
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,833
Uh, Sumomo!

242
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,333
Aye! To do that, please
connect me to the TV now.

243
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you sure it
will actually work

244
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,933
with the connection
in a building like this?

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,233
Huh?

246
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,966
Do you really think it's
going to be a problem?

247
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,700
It takes an
exceptionally high bandwidth

248
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:45,933
to download video files in

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,733
any reasonable amount of time.

250
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,766
Therefore, it's
unadvisable to attempt to-

251
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,466
Huh?

252
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:52,700
Well that's a relief!

253
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:53,966
It looks like it's working.

254
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,400
Playing back the first file.

255
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,766
Did you have any
specific concerns

256
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,266
when you first decided
to marry a Persocom?

257
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,766
Oh, well I had some
reservations, or course.

258
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,800
For one thing, I was concerned
whether her marrying me

259
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,600
would really make
her happy or not.

260
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,966
But then, there all kinds
of different marriages

261
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,533
out there in the world,
and even though this one

262
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,533
may seem a little
unusual to some people,

263
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,866
I thought we'd be
able to build on

264
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:19,066
our happiness together and
it would develop over time.

265
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,366
Oh, I-I'm sorry!

266
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:22,866
I'm sure that must have
sounded very strange!

267
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,566
Playing back the second file.

268
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:28,233
Now that your marriage,

269
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,966
to a Persocom, has ended so
abruptly in a traffic accident,

270
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,633
how does that make you feel?

271
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,933
Is it true that the Persocom

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,533
protected you in the accident?

273
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,466
Would you ever consider
marrying another Persocom?

274
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,166
Do you plan to
cremate the Persocom?

275
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,400
Or are you just
gonna throw it out?

276
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,566
Mr. Ueda, apparently,
the Persocom

277
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,800
actually saved your
life, is that right?

278
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,300
She's not just a Persocom.

279
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,066
Please don't generalize and
diminish her life like that.

280
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,866
My wife had a proper name.

281
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,433
If you don't mind,
her name was "Yumi."

282
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,966
Huh?

283
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,666
Yumi?

284
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,200
I knew when I saw this,

285
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:06,433
that I would never be
able to measure up to her!

286
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,233
Yumi.

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,733
Yumi looked hurt too.

288
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,166
She had lots of water
coming from her eyes.

289
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:21,033
Water? You mean tears.

290
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Why do tears fall out?

291
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,033
Tears flow from happy times
and from sad times.

292
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,633
So Yumi's tears were flowing
out because she is happy?

293
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,366
No, I'm sure those were
because she was sad.

294
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,633
She said that it
just made her sad

295
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,733
whenever I was around her.

296
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,466
There's really no
other way to explain it:

297
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,000
she must hate me, that's all.

298
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,266
What is hate?

299
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,266
It means that she doesn't
want to be together.

300
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Why was Yumi out there,
looking inside the store?

301
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,833
She wants to be close
to someone she hates?

302
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,866
Well, not really...

303
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:56,000
Yumi is always looking
inside the store from outside.

304
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,066
Huh?

305
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:59,700
Over there; she was
always watching you,

306
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,500
and her face looked painful.

307
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,400
But she was different
a few minutes ago.

308
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,866
When Chi put on this outfit,

309
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:09,200
lots of tears came
from Yumi's eyes.

310
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,600
Right after she
saw these clothes.

311
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,533
That outfit is Yumi's.

312
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,533
Why does Yumi look
like she feels hurt

313
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
when she sees
this outfit on Chi?

314
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:22,133
Now Manager has a painful look.

315
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,733
Painful is very hard.

316
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,133
What would be best to do?

317
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,100
What does Manager want to do?

318
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,966
What do I want to do?

319
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:33,433
I guess I...

320
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:38,966
Chi, I need to ask
you a favor of you.

321
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,066
So when it hit me like that,

322
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,433
that I'd be somehow
be compared to her...

323
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,033
the idea was just too awful.

324
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,300
Because, well
Persocoms always do

325
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,333
everything so perfectly.

326
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
I thought it was
better to say goodbye

327
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:54,600
before I disappointed him.

328
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,266
But it's just no good.

329
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,233
It's even harder now than
it was before we broke up!

330
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,500
I understand.

331
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:10,300
It was tough for you, wasn't it?

332
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:13,933
Because by then you cared
about Mr. Ueda too much.

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,566
You're like a big brother.

334
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:20,433
So I'm like your big brother?

335
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,533
But anyway, I'm sure it was
just as tough on Mr. Ueda,

336
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,066
And even though his
first wife was a Persocom,

337
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:29,133
I'm sure it wasn't just
some decision he made lightly.

338
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,166
You're right. I know
that he wouldn't do that.

339
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,466
Yeah.

340
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,800
And if he was acting
that way towards you,

341
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,100
it can only mean
that you must've been

342
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,266
very special to him, Yumi.

343
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
What happened to
her was terrible,

344
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,300
and it must have been
the hardest time

345
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:45,466
in his whole life.

346
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,900
And yet, in spite of everything,

347
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,633
he was somehow able
to fall in love again.

348
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,900
I think that's just amazing.

349
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,000
So the truth is, I don't think

350
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,633
he'd ever compare you
with someone from his past.

351
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:58,966
But what about you?

352
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,700
Wouldn't it bother you
just a teeny bit, Senpai?

353
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,033
Me? Well,

354
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,533
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess I would.

355
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,666
But, I wouldn't make any
comparisons like that.

356
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,300
Why do you say that?

357
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,300
Because I think
I can imagine how

358
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,466
I'd feel if someone
did that to me.

359
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:19,766
He couldn't do something

360
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,400
like that anymore than I could.

361
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,133
He's not that type of person.

362
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,200
Thank you, Motosuwa.

363
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,566
Chi!

364
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:28,766
Manager!

365
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,066
But how did you
know we were here?

366
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,733
Well, actually; I got
a little help from Chi.

367
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,500
She did me a really big favor;

368
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:37,033
she was able to
locate Yumi by accessing

369
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,866
the number to
her mobile Persocom.

370
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,366
And here we are.

371
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,900
How could that be?

372
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't get it; it never rang.

373
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:47,066
Huh?

374
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,933
I'm sorry to intrude
on you like this.

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,833
No, please come on in.

376
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,333
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

377
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,666
No, you didn't do
anything, Manager.

378
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,800
That's easy to say,
but it's not true.

379
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,566
It is my fault; if I had
explained it to you properly,

380
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,933
I'd have spared you
every one of those tears.

381
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,700
The reason that
I decided to ask Yumi

382
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,633
to get married to me
in the first place was

383
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,333
because of who she was.

384
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
It wasn't just because
she was a Persocom.

385
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:26,566
And that's just how I felt

386
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,600
when I fell in
love with you, Yumi,

387
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,233
because of who you are.

388
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,533
Yumi, somehow you think that

389
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,000
that "Yumi," the
Persocom, was perfect.

390
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:40,466
But believe me;
it wasn't like that.

391
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:41,633
There are things
that they can do

392
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,000
because they're Persocoms,

393
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,400
but there're some
things they can't do

394
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,466
because they're Persocoms.

395
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,066
It's really just
the same as people

396
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:53,200
having certain things they
can or can't do, that's all.

397
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:57,966
I thought that I'd never
be able to fall in love again.

398
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,233
Especially that I'd
never be able to fall

399
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,766
in love with another Persocom.

400
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,533
But, you know,

401
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,000
even if you were
a Persocom, Yumi,

402
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,700
I think I would have fallen
in love with you anyway.

403
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,433
Oh, Yumi, I'm sorry!

404
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,533
What have I done?
I made you cry again!

405
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,233
Chi?

406
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,833
C-Chi?!

407
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,933
Chi made a mistake.

408
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,233
Here. Manager said that
this outfit belongs to Yumi.

409
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,566
Thank you.

410
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:37,033
Manager, I, um, I'm sorry.

411
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm really sorry.

412
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:44,000
I was... I just...

413
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,600
Thank you for falling
in love with me!

414
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,233
Chi?

415
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,000
There are things
that they can do

416
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,500
because they're Persocoms,

417
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:20,900
but there're some
things they can't do

418
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,633
because they're Persocoms.

419
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,733
It's really just the
same as people having

420
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,200
certain things they can
or can't do, that's all.

421
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,666
Even if you were
a Persocom, Yumi,

422
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,866
I think I would have fallen
in love with you anyway.

423
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,200
Chi.

424
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,200
Hideki.

425
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,566
Happy holding hands?

426
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,100
Chi...

427
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,933
Ah, it looks like The One
Just for Me has been decided.

428
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,933
I guess I have no choice
but to go over there now.

429
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,100
I hope that this turns
out to be a happy ending.

430
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,433
Hm?

431
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,533
What's going on?

432
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,766
Nothing.

433
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,700
Hm?

434
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,200
One person completely
fills me up.

435
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:06,100
I'm happy when
that person laughs.

436
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,466
I'm happy when that
person is by my side.

437
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:13,633
Yes. I feel happy when
that person is happy.

438
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,733
Different from the others,
that person is my dearest...

439
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,233
my special one...

440
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,666
"The One Just for Me."

441
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,833
