1
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:55,333
Are you The One
that is Just for Me?

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,033
I, uh...

3
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,966
Chi is in love with Hideki.

4
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:03,666
Is Hideki in love with Chi?

5
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,666
Chi, I...

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,933
This is the...

7
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,366
It's a voice.

8
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,566
What is it? Is something wrong ?

9
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,666
Yuzuki!

10
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,633
Miss Sumomo!

11
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,600
Hm?

12
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:40,500
That voice again.
Uh, what is it?

13
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,333
Hey, come on, you two,
what's going on?

14
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,500
Hey!

15
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,733
Chi.

16
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,200
Chi, I...

17
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,533
I...

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,566
I'm in love with you, Chi.

19
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,700
Hideki.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,100
I found...

21
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,633
the person just for Chi.

22
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,566
Chi.

23
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,533
Chi?

24
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,833
I must do it. Myself...
and my other self.

25
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
Chi?

26
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,500
Chi!

27
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,166
Yuzuki!

28
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,666
Yuzuki!

29
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,066
Hey, are you guys okay?

30
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,400
H-Hey!

31
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,266
Chi has found.

32
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,300
The One Just For Me.
Chi's special person.

33
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,400
The one just for me.
Chi's special person.

34
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,300
The person just for Chi.

35
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,066
Chi has found.

36
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:29,933
The One Just For Me.
Chi's special person.

37
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,800
The person just for Chi.

38
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:34,833
What is that voice?!

39
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,333
Somehow it's echoing
directly into my CPU!

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,900
We're all hearing
the same thing.

41
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,866
Because that girl is
linked to all Persocoms.

42
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,100
You and I were
supposedly designed

43
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,866
so we'd be immune to it.

44
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,800
But we do come from the
same system after all.

45
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,233
Whoever the enemy is...

46
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,200
I don't care.

47
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,766
I'm going to do it
before it's too late.

48
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm going in!

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,333
Don't get in my way.

50
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,566
Surprising...

51
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,133
to be able to bounce Dita's
attack program like that...

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,733
If I can't hack my way in,
I'll connect directly!

53
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:14,933
Sorry about this,

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
but I'm gonna stop you!

55
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,633
Chi!

56
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,966
What are you doing?!
Get away from her!!

57
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,733
Hope you'll forgive me.

58
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,066
Let me go! Who are
you guys, anyway?!

59
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,700
And what are you doing to Chi?

60
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:40,900
We're Persocoms.

61
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,700
We were specifically
created to stop this girl.

62
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:44,966
What's that?!

63
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,066
She is a dangerous Persocom.

64
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,700
Dangerous? Chi?!

65
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,566
What are you doing?!

66
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,533
He's an outsider;

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
you're not supposed
to say things like that!

68
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,066
He's not an outsider.

69
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,166
He is "The One Just for Me."

70
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,166
This girl is
programmed to connect

71
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,533
to every Persocom in
the world, and then,

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,033
when she decides who
"The One Just for Me" is,

73
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,366
she's designed to
run a certain program.

74
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,666
What are you talking about?!

75
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,700
What is Chi supposed to do?

76
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,966
I can't answer that;

77
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:13,666
because I have no data
concerning what will happen.

78
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,633
We were created to
keep it from occurring;

79
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,066
not to predict what
the outcome might be.

80
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,866
We're designed
to stop the program

81
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,800
and make sure it
never runs again.

82
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,933
That means...

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,466
That we're gonna destroy
the OS and stop all functions.

84
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,266
We're going to annihilate her.

85
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,633
Stop it! Don't do it! Chi!

86
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,866
Lemme go!

87
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,433
Why in the world are you getting
so worked up over a Persocom?

88
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,966
Someone I care about's being
erased right in front of me.

89
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,166
You would, too, if you--

90
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,466
You forget: Persocoms don't
have those kind of emotions.

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,266
Nothing good ever comes out
of a romance with a Persocom.

92
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,966
Persocoms are too
different from humans.

93
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,633
Yeah, well whether she's
a Persocom or a human,

94
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
that just doesn't matter to me.

95
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,166
'Cause I fell in love with Chi.

96
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,000
Chi and nobody else.

97
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,400
Zima?!

98
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
Hey, what're you doing?

99
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,033
Chi!

100
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,200
What're you trying to do, Zima?

101
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,866
I want to see it now.

102
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:32,200
His... no, their future.

103
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,833
And the future of Persocoms.

104
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,600
I must do it.
Myself and my other self.

105
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,233
Chi!

106
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,133
Chi has found.

107
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,566
The One Just For Me.

108
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:53,200
Chi's special person.

109
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,266
The person just for Chi.

110
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,066
Hideki.

111
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,533
Darling...

112
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,366
Chi! Chi!

113
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,866
Chi, thank goodness!

114
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,066
Are you all right, Chi?

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,333
Chi?

116
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,633
Chi.

117
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,000
It can't be!

118
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,366
Hideki.

119
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,700
I am not Chi.

120
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:35,333
Chi?

121
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,600
I am...

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,666
Freya?!

123
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,866
I am Freya.

124
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,033
What does this mean?

125
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,433
I dunno.

126
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,366
CPU, hard drive, system...
everything's normal.

127
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,533
How 'bout you, Zima?

128
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Yeah...

129
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,466
Lord Minoru...

130
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,433
Yuzuki!

131
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,266
Are you all right?!
Anything wrong?!

132
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,833
No, everything's fine.

133
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,433
Was it the same voice as before?

134
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,633
Yes, but...

135
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,766
It was definitely the same,

136
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,566
but this time the
voice sounded very sad.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Huh?

138
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,300
You had me worried there.

139
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,966
So're you guys
back to normal now?

140
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:37,833
You okay?

141
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Aye!

142
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,600
That voice... there it is again.

143
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,866
Freya?

144
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Miss Hibiya.

145
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,733
Freya!

146
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,000
Mama.

147
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:57,966
What is it?
Why did you come back?

148
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,466
Freya, where is Chi?
Where did she go?

149
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,266
Please tell me what's
happened to her?

150
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,500
But wait a minute.

151
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,533
Chi's original name
was Elda, wasn't it?

152
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Freya disappeared
because of her feelings

153
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,733
about your husband, right?

154
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,200
When the pain in
my heart made it

155
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:22,233
so I could no longer move,

156
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,266
and I thought that
I was almost gone for good...

157
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,533
Come to me.

158
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,200
Before you disappear, Freya,
transfer your heart inside mine.

159
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:45,433
I will protect you.

160
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,400
I will protect
your heart, Freya.

161
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:55,800
So please, come in.
And we can be one.

162
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:03,066
Freya. You were
there the whole time?

163
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,100
But what about Chi?

164
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,166
Tell me what happened to Chi!

165
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,833
Miss Hibiya, can you
explain this to me?

166
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,333
You know I don't know
much about Persocoms,

167
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,566
and I have no idea
what's going on!

168
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,333
Chi has disappeared.

169
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,666
Disappeared?

170
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:22,066
Chi has found
"The One Just for Me."

171
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:25,933
She was doing what she had
to do once she found him,

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,366
but she stopped in the middle.

173
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:31,400
Why did she stop?

174
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,166
Because she found out,

175
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,800
that even if Persocoms
fell in love with people,

176
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:41,233
there were things
they just couldn't do.

177
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,866
Even if "The One Just for Me"
were to fall in love with me.

178
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,466
I couldn't do anything.

179
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,466
I don't know much,
but I know you're wrong.

180
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,700
There's no difference between
humans and Persocoms

181
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:54,266
when it comes to
things like this.

182
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,166
I know, because
I fell in love with Chi.

183
00:12:57,233 --> 00:13:00,900
Maybe so, but Chi didn't
think so for some reason.

184
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:03,866
Chi! Can you hear me?!

185
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,800
I know you're in there!
Ya gotta believe me!

186
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,333
Please come out!

187
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,266
Freya, we need to know
what happened to Chi.

188
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,566
I can't answer that;
because I'm unable access her.

189
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Mama, I'm afraid
there's no other way.

190
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,400
The time has finally
come to destroy us.

191
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,233
How can you say
something like that?!

192
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,833
I was in love with Papa.

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,266
When the pain in my heart was
so strong that I couldn't move,

194
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,333
I thought about telling
him my true feelings

195
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,700
when you weren't there.

196
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,300
But I couldn't do it.

197
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:46,666
You must face the facts:
we are a failure.

198
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,666
Darling...

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,033
Mr. Motosuwa, please forgive me.

200
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,066
Huh?

201
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,500
"Chobits."

202
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:05,400
Huh? "Chobits"?

203
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:06,400
Entered.

204
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:09,633
Password and voice
recognition are confirmed.

205
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,600
Miss Hibiya, what is it?

206
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,200
What are you going to do?

207
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,266
Well, isn't this an
interesting turn of events?

208
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,466
I guess it means that program
won't be running after all.

209
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:22,033
Standing by, master.

210
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,666
Please give me
your instructions.

211
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,066
No! Don't do it!

212
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:29,800
Deletion of all data, and
termination of your system.

213
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,266
Chi, don't!

214
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,533
Confirmed.

215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,266
Proceeding with deletion of all
data and termination of system.

216
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,200
No! You can't do this! Chi!

217
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,633
Initiate.

218
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,466
Chi!

219
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,533
Procedure completed.

220
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,566
"Chobits"!

221
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,933
"Chobits"!

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,066
"Chobits"! "Chobits"!

223
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:19,333
I'm afraid it won't work.

224
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,566
For it to be recognized,
the password has to be spoken

225
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,233
in either my voice
or my husband's.

226
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,066
Chi really was in love with you.

227
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,433
I'm pretty sure you know that,

228
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,666
but I just wanted
to say it anyway.

229
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,400
And that was why she
decided to pull away

230
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:34,100
from you like that in the end.

231
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm sorry, it looks
like the only thing

232
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,900
I brought to you was
sadness, Mr. Motosuwa.

233
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:45,566
So it's all over.
We should get going, huh?

234
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,933
It's too bad.

235
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,900
I thought he might have actually
be able to change things.

236
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,566
I'm sorry, Chi.

238
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,933
I guess I really
didn't understand

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,333
anything about you after all.

240
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,166
And in the end, all I did
was bring you so much pain.

241
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,000
I never even got the
chance to teach you

242
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:19,033
what true happiness really is.

243
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:22,533
Hey, if Chi is still
in there somewhere,

244
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,000
do you think it would be
possible for you to teach her?

245
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,133
Teach her about happiness,

246
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,533
and how it's about
being together

247
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,100
with the person you
truly love no matter what.

248
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,433
And also about how there're
going to be lots of hard times

249
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,033
and painful times, too,
you can't avoid them.

250
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,133
But that stuff doesn't
matter at all in the end,

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
because just so much
better to be together

252
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,033
than it is to be apart.

253
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,433
All I want to do
is make Chi happy.

254
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,766
What is it?

255
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:05,333
A long time ago, something
very bad happened to me.

256
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,166
It still makes my heart ache.

257
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:13,666
It made me very, very, very sad.

258
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,500
It was very painful.

259
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:19,266
It hurt a lot when
I lost something so dear.

260
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,566
But, I am searching.

261
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,366
For the person just for me,

262
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:31,866
someone who will love me
because I am myself.

263
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,600
And, I found him.

264
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:43,200
But that was the beginning of
something even more painful.

265
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,866
It is painful to be next to him,

266
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,066
though I could not do anything.

267
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:55,166
It is painful to see
him go through pain.

268
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,266
That is why I decided
to stop being

269
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,466
in front of him and disappear.

270
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:05,233
I disappeared
because I loved him.

271
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,966
And yet, it's even more painful
being unable to see him.

272
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,800
And even more painful
not being able to meet him.

273
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:22,333
I parted ways with him
because I loved him.

274
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:26,100
You parted ways
though you loved him?

275
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:30,133
Because that meant
happiness for him.

276
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,566
What is happiness?

277
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:36,366
Happiness is...

278
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:43,400
Hideki.

279
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,033
Is this your happiness?

280
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,866
My happiness is right here.

281
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,633
My happiness exists
only inside him.

282
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,266
Even if it's painful?

283
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,233
Even if it makes
your heart ache?

284
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,900
Even if it makes my heart ache,
I want to be with him.

285
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes.

286
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,933
I found it.

287
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:32,766
Chi's happiness.

288
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,700
Chi.

289
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:38,833
Chi!

290
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,600
Yuzuki!

291
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,800
I hear a voice again.

292
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:47,033
But it seems to be
different from the last one.

293
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,066
The voice seems very pleasant;

294
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,533
and somehow kinder and warm.

295
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,933
Oh, not this again!
Come on, you guys!

296
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:10,866
Hey, wait a minute.

297
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,333
Zima!

298
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,833
Do you think she might have...?

299
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,733
Yeah.

300
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,566
Uh-oh! Let me check it out!

301
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,466
It's all right.

302
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,333
Oh, Zima...

303
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,366
Why are blushing like that?
After all, you're a Persocom.

304
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,966
Hideki.

305
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,433
Hm?

306
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,733
Chi is a Persocom.

307
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,333
That's right.

308
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,300
Chi is not human.

309
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:46,666
There are things
that Chi cannot do.

310
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:47,633
I know.

311
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,300
But Chi wants to be
together with Hideki.

312
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,000
I know, Chi.

313
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:56,266
I want to be together
with you, too.

314
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,633
Darling...

315
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:13,633
This town is full of people.

316
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,866
This town is full of them.

317
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,000
Everyone falls in
love with someone,

318
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:24,166
and is in turn loved by someone.

319
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,633
All sorts of people,
and all sorts of them,

320
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,800
live in all sorts of places.

321
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,366
Oh, sorry about that.

322
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:36,333
Among lots of people...
and lots of them,

323
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,200
he had found me.

324
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,366
Good morning.

325
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:40,900
Good morning to you.

326
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,000
He had fallen in love with me.

327
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,000
Lord Minoru,
I brought you some tea,

328
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:45,833
would you like to take a break?

329
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,600
I am here right now.

330
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,900
Thank you, Yuzuki.

331
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,500
I am here together with him.
