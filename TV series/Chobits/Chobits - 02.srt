1
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,333
Mmm.

2
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
It's so bright.

3
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:12,466
I really oughta get
some curtains in here.

4
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:16,466
But before I fix this place,
I gotta clean it up.

5
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,466
Chi.

6
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,533
Oh, that's right!

7
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,933
I forgot, I found a
Persocom last night, didn't I?

8
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,833
Hm?

9
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,066
Chi. Chi.

10
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,166
Look at how cute she is!

11
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,333
I can't believe it;
she's so incredibly cute,

12
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
and she can do everything!

13
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,833
Oh, this is gonna be great!

14
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,566
Games! Online shopping!

15
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:11,466
Personal ads! And Internet porn!

16
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,366
That's right!

17
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:18,766
Now at last
I get to have it all!

18
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:26,500
Hey, what're you...

19
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,500
Yah! Why am I getting
so excited in the morning?

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,366
Motosuwa!

21
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,866
Hm?

22
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,766
Please pardon the intrusion.

23
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,333
Oh, well ah, this uh...

24
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,166
Well now, what have we here?

25
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,866
Hardly even settled in
and you've already

26
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:42,366
had a girl over for the night.

27
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,433
That's not too shabby,
I gotta say.

28
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,833
Not too shabby, I've gotta say,

29
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,533
not too shabby, I've gotta say.

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,266
It's not like that!

31
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,200
Oh really? Then what is it like?

32
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,100
It's, well, take a
good look at her!

33
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,466
She's a Persocom!

34
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,933
Hm?

35
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,433
Oh, I see what you mean.

36
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,333
See? No matter
how you look at her,

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,066
she's a still just a Persocom.

38
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:05,300
I see. But then again,
you gotta admit,

39
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,200
she's a really cute Persocom!

40
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,633
So this must be what
you were hiding last night.

41
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,633
Huh?! So that's what it was.

42
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,066
I thought you
were hiding something

43
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,333
when I came over.

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,766
Uh, well, uh, I uh...

45
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,833
You didn't have to
hide her, you know.

46
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,366
Yeah, you're right,
I suppose not.

47
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,033
Wait a sec.

48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,333
Didn't you tell me that
you didn't have a Persocom?

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,733
Well, uh, it's because I...

50
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,033
Well, to find a computer
like this for free,

51
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,166
I'd have to say
you're nothing less

52
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,666
than incredibly lucky!

53
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,733
You really think so?

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,166
Oh yeah, absolutely,
and she's a really cute one.

55
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,766
I see, well I guess I did
get pretty lucky in that area.

56
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,466
So what exactly
can a Persocom do?

57
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,800
The real question is more like:

58
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,166
what do you want her to do?

59
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,100
Huh?

60
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,233
Well, I guess,
among other things,

61
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,466
I wanted to try
going on the Internet.

62
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,500
To get to the net, there's a
little connector right in here.

63
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,166
Chi...

64
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,400
That's all she says.

65
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,633
Hmm? Well, maybe she's broken.

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,333
Course, I don't know
anything about computers.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,966
We can use that monitor there.

68
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:07,233
Monitor? This screen
right over here.

69
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,933
Oh! You mean the TV?

70
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,600
So far so good; it's got
ports for an RGB cable,

71
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,566
so at least we can make
the connection there.

72
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,933
Now in just a second here,

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,766
we should be able to
see the default specs

74
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,600
for the system as well
as the CPU speed

75
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,400
and what version the OS is.

76
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,033
I see. Hmm.

77
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,633
I didn't know
anything about that.

78
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,066
Actually, I don't have a
clue what he's talking about.

79
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,366
Oh wow, that's great.

80
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,366
You did it! What's "No Data"?

81
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:39,200
"No Data" can only mean
that it's all been lost

82
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,566
or there's hasn't been
anything installed on it yet.

83
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,233
Oh, I see.
I don't get it at all.

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,633
I don't get it. Huh?

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,800
It doesn't make sense.

86
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,366
If she doesn't have an OS,

87
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,933
how can she move?

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,300
So they need to
have this "OS" thing

89
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,933
or else they can't move?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,166
Yeah, OS means Operating System.

91
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,866
And unless a computer has system

92
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,300
software installed,
it can't function.

93
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,733
It's a mannequin. I get it now.

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,833
And to get the right software,

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,333
I'm gonna have to buy it.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
And it costs a lot? Yep.

97
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,033
But, which version of the OS

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,600
are we supposed
to install in this model?

99
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,600
Hey, can I mess with her?

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,033
"Mess with her"? Mess where?

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,066
Let's see. That's strange.

102
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,600
I wonder what brand she is.

103
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,666
If she's from PCN,

104
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,266
she'd have her model
number right here.

105
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,333
W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wait!

106
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,333
Now as I recall... Waah!

107
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,233
What are you doing?

108
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,700
No, it's: what are you doing?!

109
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,266
Finding the model number.

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,766
Hey, get a grip
on yourself, willya?

111
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,766
Are you gonna be able
to handle a Persocom?

112
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,400
What do you mean?

113
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,033
Hey, she's only a computer!

114
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,933
It's no problem;
I'm gonna be fine!

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
All right.

116
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll let Sumomo check her out.

117
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,033
I'll just connect
them together here.

118
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,600
It's up to you, Sumomo. Aye!

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,966
Hm?

120
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,900
Ah! Wait, what's
the matter with her?

121
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:20,833
She's gone crazy!

122
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,400
Huh?

123
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,200
Oh, my poor little Persocom!

124
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,666
Sumomo's broken!

125
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,033
What's going on?

126
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,100
She's a goner. Oh Sumomo oh!

127
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,600
Oh I see.

128
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:39,100
This is turning into
a great big mess.

129
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,600
Anyway, I guess I should go meet

130
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,933
this guy that Shinbo
said I should see.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can walk there;
it's really close.

132
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,333
Uh, by the way,

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,266
what do you mean
by "custom-made"?

134
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,966
I've never seen
anything like this model,

135
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:57,533
and she seems to have
a really monster CPU.

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,000
You have to figure that
someone made her by hand.

137
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,566
There are Persocoms
that are made by hand?

138
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,666
Yeah.

139
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,000
This guy's a really
top-notch Persocom specialist.

140
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,266
He might be able to
help you out somehow.

141
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,700
"Custom made," he says.

142
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,533
Anyway, we should go see him.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Chi.

144
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,933
Oh, hello, Mr. Motosuwa
and Miss Persocom.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,333
Hi there.

146
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,566
Chi.

147
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:33,133
Oh dear, aren't those
clothes awfully loose on her?

148
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,466
Hm?

149
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,033
Well, I-I just got
her last night;

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,166
I couldn't get her
any clothes yet.

151
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,600
It's not like I'm a weirdo
dressing her like a man

152
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,866
like some pervert or something!

153
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:41,966
I see.

154
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,433
Well, if you don't mind
hand-me-downs,

155
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,166
I can let you have
some of my clothes.

156
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,266
Huh?

157
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,733
Are you sure about that?

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,933
Thank you very much!

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,700
Chi.

160
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,166
You're entirely welcome.

161
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,633
You can just drop by
my apartment any time.

162
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,566
Great!

163
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,266
Well then, we'll be on our way!

164
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,933
Chi!

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,666
Have a nice day!

166
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,366
Well that would
really be a big help.

167
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:07,100
I'll bet women's clothes
are incredibly expensive.

168
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,400
If they're Miss Hibiya's
hand-me-downs,

169
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,900
then that's also gotta mean
that she used to wear them.

170
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,466
Huh? Hah?! Oh no, no!

171
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,600
I can't think those things!

172
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,400
This Persocom is going
to wear these clothes!

173
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:24,966
Chi!

174
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:35,933
According to the map,

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,333
it should be somewhere
right around here.

176
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Hm?

177
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,900
Hm?

178
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,900
Is this is the place?!

179
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,566
Okay, now I'm starting
to get a bit irritated.

180
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,066
It's like they think
I'm gonna get all impressed

181
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,966
because he's rich
and everything.

182
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,066
Yes, Kokubunji residence.

183
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,666
Uh, my name is Motosuwa.

184
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,700
Um, is Mr. Minoru in?

185
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,666
Oh yes, we heard
you were coming.

186
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,066
Please come in.

187
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,500
Uh, excuse me.

188
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,366
Don't get a nosebleed
over just a few Persocoms.

189
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:46,800
You must be Hideki Motosuwa?

190
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,500
Uh, yeah. And you're...?

191
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,733
I'm Minoru Kokubunji.
How do you do?

192
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,433
Ah, Shinbo said
that he knew someone

193
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,066
who was an expert on
custom-made computers.

194
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,533
It can't be. You just look so...

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,533
You expected
someone a bit older?

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,633
Umm, sorta.

197
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,533
Yes.

198
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,533
Well then, enough
of the pleasantries.

199
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,500
Won't you join us inside?

200
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,766
Please attend to him.

201
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,833
Huh? Attend to--

202
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:11,966
Hello there.

203
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,000
We'll take off your shoes now.

204
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,266
Huh? Wha?!

205
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,933
Try not to get all hot

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and bothered by my Persocoms.

207
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,400
Oh, whatever;
just don't soil them.

208
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:28,100
Wait, just a minute! Hey!

209
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,966
Wait! Stop that!
What are you...!

210
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,133
Chi!!

211
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,333
No Chi, you don't have
to do what they do!

212
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Okay okay, that's enough,

213
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,633
just stop it already.

214
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,333
Willya knock it off?
I can't take it.

215
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:43,466
It's this girl.

216
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:44,033
Huh?!

217
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,433
The mysterious Persocom.

218
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,300
She's the one that
Shinbo was talking about.

219
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,466
Chi?

220
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:55,566
She's somehow moving
without an Operating System.

221
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,400
W-What's going on here?!

222
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,366
I hope you can repair them.

223
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,900
I thought you said
just a quick check-up.

224
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:10,866
Hmmm...

225
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,833
I guess my equipment's just not
powerful enough to analyze her.

226
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,933
Four life-size computers
aren't enough?!

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,633
Would you like me
to give it a try?

228
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Huh?

229
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:27,233
Yuzuki.

230
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,333
Please excuse us.

231
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,833
My name is Hideki Motosuwa.

232
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,300
Welcome to our home.

233
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:35,233
How do you do?
My name is Yuzuki.

234
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,433
So, you would be
Mr. Kokubunji's elder sister?

235
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,333
Oh no. I'm a Persocom

236
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,833
who was custom
built by Lord Minoru.

237
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,200
Gah?!

238
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,533
Lord Minoru?

239
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,733
But.

240
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,266
You are curious to find
out her capabilities, right?

241
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,900
It's a pleasure to know you.

242
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,466
Chi.

243
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,766
Are those sounds
coming from her?

244
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,133
Chi?

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,400
That's enough! Yuzuki!

246
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,500
A portion of my data
seems to have crashed.

247
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,266
Which data?

248
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,700
Household chores,
some stock information.

249
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,833
Not your personality data?

250
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,533
No.

251
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,033
Hey, is she okay? Is she hurt?

252
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,166
Chi?

253
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:01,400
I'm just fine.
There are no ill effects.

254
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,466
Don't worry.
You may rest assured.

255
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,366
Well, that's a big relief.

256
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,633
Chi.

257
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,500
I guess there's not much
chance she'd break, huh?

258
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:10,500
For starters, she doesn't

259
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,966
even have one of
those OS things, right?

260
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,200
That isn't true.

261
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,000
Huh?

262
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,400
I can't tell you
with any certainty

263
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,533
whether there's been an
Operating System installed

264
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,066
in your computer
or not, Lord Motosuwa.

265
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:22,566
So you don't know?

266
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:26,033
No. Her data's
protected very well.

267
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,366
Huh?!

268
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,566
Protected? What's that?

269
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,266
Are you sure you're
going to be alright?

270
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,266
Thank you, I'll be fine.

271
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,933
Lord Minoru has made
the corrections already.

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,866
But you said some of
your data had crashed.

273
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,900
Since that data
was all backed up;

274
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,066
we can simply reinstall it
and it will be fine.

275
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,800
And that data in question
was a very small amount.

276
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,400
Oh, I see.

277
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,400
Hm?

278
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:56,466
Hm? What?

279
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,266
Oh, um, it's nothing at all.

280
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:02,133
Well, she might be a "chobits."

281
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Chobits? And what
does that mean?

282
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,800
Hmm.

283
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,066
Chobits?

284
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:10,833
I guess you might call
them legendary Persocoms.

285
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,166
Legendary?!

286
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,433
It's like an urban
legend that's been

287
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,033
floating around on
the Internet for awhile.

288
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,533
Rumor is: there was a series

289
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,400
of Persocoms secretly developed
under the codename "chobits."

290
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:24,800
Lots of Persocoms are developed
all over the world, right?

291
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,000
After all, you make 'em too,
don't you Kokubunji?

292
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,200
Call me Minoru.

293
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,533
Oh, sure.

294
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,200
"Chobits" are
Persocoms that have

295
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,066
the ability to move entirely
of their own free will.

296
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,500
Huh? Can't Miss
Yuzuki do that too?

297
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:41,066
She volunteered to do the
analysis for us earlier.

298
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,500
Not really.

299
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,000
Yuzuki merely moved the way

300
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,866
I programmed her, that's all.

301
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,400
She followed the program
that I installed in her.

302
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:50,200
It tells her what's
right and wrong,

303
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:53,066
and how to perform various
functions effectively.

304
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,966
All of her actions are
based upon calculating

305
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,166
what she's been programmed.

306
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:00,366
Of course, she does have her own
automatic learning program.

307
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,033
But then, even those actions

308
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,433
that seem like free will
are actually dependent

309
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,400
upon the learning program.

310
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,133
She can break and on occasions

311
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,133
she'll even freeze up,
but without a program,

312
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,833
she can't do anything.

313
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,800
But, that's not how
the "chobits" are.

314
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeah!

315
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,033
So then she's an amazing
Persocom, unlike any other!!

316
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,833
But I'm sure it's just a rumor.

317
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:24,766
Chi!

318
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,200
It's just one of
those urban legends.

319
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:28,166
It's comes from a
desire for something

320
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,100
human-shaped that
isn't actually human

321
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,700
and subject to
all our limitations,

322
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,766
yet has free will and emotions.

323
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,600
Is that so?

324
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,333
Chi?

325
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,133
Is she different?

326
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,366
Yes.

327
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,300
She doesn't resemble
any past or currently

328
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:51,400
produced computer model
in any available database.

329
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:54,666
Then she must be custom made.

330
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:56,600
I'll see what I can
find out about this.

331
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,000
There's also a forum for
custom-built computers.

332
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,433
I can always write in and see

333
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,533
if there's anyone who
might have a clue about it.

334
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,533
Thank you.

335
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
But what do you
mean by a "forum"?

336
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,566
What's your e-mail address?

337
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,633
I'll write you later on.

338
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,066
Uh, well I don't have one.

339
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,533
Why don't you call me?

340
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,633
Let's see, something
to write with...

341
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,466
Just can just tell Yuzuki
your phone number.

342
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,666
Please say it,
and I'll record it.

343
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,233
You may start.

344
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,700
Uh sure. Let's see.

345
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:30,366
It's area code 03-688-2852df3

346
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,466
Hm?

347
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,700
Recording completed.

348
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,066
That's amazing.

349
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,400
Mr. Motosuwa,
why don't you ask yours

350
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,100
to repeat your number for us?

351
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:42,900
Huh?

352
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:43,666
Why?

353
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,200
Just do it.

354
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:46,533
So tell me:

355
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,133
what's the number of
my telephone at home?

356
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,533
03-688-2852df3

357
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,233
She spoke!

358
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
She didn't just say "chi"!

359
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,433
Well that means
she's already had

360
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,100
her learning software installed.

361
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,166
Really?!

362
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,466
You said you found her
in a dumpster, didn't you?

363
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,666
I wonder if she was
formatted before that?

364
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,033
Either way, her learning
function seems to be working.

365
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm sure she'll speak,
if you teach her,

366
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,766
and learn to do all sorts
of other different things.

367
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,733
You think so?

368
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,266
If you treat her
properly Mr. Motosuwa.

369
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,266
Me?!

370
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh yes, Mr. Motosuwa.

371
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,266
Since you are her current owner,

372
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,366
she will move, relate, and
respond just as you teach her.

373
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,466
Respond just as I teach her.

374
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,800
So that means I won't have
to get any software then?!

375
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,300
No, you'll have to buy some.

376
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,133
I knew it.

377
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,933
Don't worry.

378
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,066
I don't know what
kind of software

379
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,266
you can install in her.

380
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,600
This'll take some time.

381
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,100
But as she continues
learning more,

382
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,433
I'm sure she'll wind up
telling you herself.

383
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Ah, I get it now,
well thanks for everything!

384
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,366
No problem.

385
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,366
Sorry to bother you.

386
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,566
Please come again when you can.

387
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,466
Mr. Motosuwa!

388
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,300
Huh?

389
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,633
Even if she begins
to speak and manages

390
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,066
to learn various other things

391
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:06,133
you never thought were possible.

392
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,833
No matter how nice she is,
no matter how cute...

393
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,666
For your own sake,
don't fall in love.

394
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,633
Huh?

395
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,066
If you don't want to cry.

396
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:22,666
But, that's...

397
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,433
Chi.

398
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,800
Well, let's go home.

399
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,600
Chi.

400
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:45,366
She's only a Persocom!
To fall in love, there's no way.

401
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,966
Chi.

402
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,933
She's just so incredibly cute.

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,500
Hmm. But, now to teach her.
How'm I supposed to do that?

404
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:58,933
Chi.

405
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:05,966
Here you are.

406
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, I just hope they're
the right size and all.

407
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,866
Don't worry!
Thank you very much!

408
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,633
I hope I didn't
trouble you at all.

409
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,466
Uh, no, of course not.

410
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,433
What are you talking about?

411
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,800
It's exactly what we
needed, really. Right?

412
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,233
Chi!

413
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,533
That's great.

414
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,466
Oh wow. That's nice.

415
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,166
Why don't you try this one on?

416
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,500
Chi.

417
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,233
Hey, hey, wait a minute!

418
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,533
Chi?

419
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,100
If you go stripping
like that... oh man.

420
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,466
I'll just have to
look the other way!

421
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,300
Is it all right?

422
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,166
Chi.

423
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,266
You look great!

424
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,766
Chi.

425
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,100
You're so cute.

426
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,933
Okay now, so how can
I start to teach you?

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,766
Hmm...

428
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,466
Chi.

429
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:42,166
Hey, that's it: your name!
Shinbo and Kokubunji, well,

430
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,600
they both have names for
their computers, don't they?

431
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,300
Chi.

432
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,866
Hey, that's the way. Right?

433
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,400
The first thing we've gotta
teach you is your name.

434
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,733
Chi.

435
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:53,833
Chi.

436
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,733
Chi?

437
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Chi, huh?

438
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:57,700
Chi?

439
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,066
That's it! That's your name!

440
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,033
From now on, your name is Chi.

441
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,533
You understand, Chi?

442
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,000
Chi!

443
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,533
Nah!

444
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,566
Well, I might not know just what

445
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,366
the best approach
is for teaching,

446
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,200
but I promise
you I'll keep trying.

447
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:19,000
Well, let's do our best
together, right Chi?

448
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,533
Chi!!

449
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,666
For starters,
I guess we should get

450
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,433
you some underwear.

451
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,866
Chi.

452
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,366
Chi, what do you say
when someone's going out?

453
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,366
"Take care."

454
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:07,300
What's my name?

455
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:08,500
Hideki.

456
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,266
Good! Okay, and what's that?

457
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,566
Hideki.

458
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,566
Uh, no. It isn't. It's a kettle.

459
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:14,400
Hideki.

460
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:15,066
A kettle.

461
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,233
Hideki. Hideki.

462
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,466
That's a table
and a rice cooker.

463
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:21,566
Hideki. Hideki. Hideki. Hideki.

464
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,266
Chobits next episode:
"Chi Learns."

465
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,500
There are so many Hideki's here,

466
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,233
but the only Hideki that can
make money to live is me?
