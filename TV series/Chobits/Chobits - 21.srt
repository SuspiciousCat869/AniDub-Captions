1
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,800
There we go.

2
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,666
Well, that the last of it.

3
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,500
Are you sure you haven't
forgotten anything?

4
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,266
Oh, well lemme just make sure.

5
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,933
Oh, thanks!

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
Chi!

7
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,733
Shinbo decided to move out so he

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,700
and Miss Shimizu
could live together.

9
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,900
Well, we've pretty much
got everything, I'd say.

10
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:25,266
The whole kidnapping
incident's over now,

11
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,266
and things are back to normal.

12
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,966
I still go to prep school,

13
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,300
and I still work at
the pub, My Pleasure.

14
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:38,766
But even though everything
looks the same as before,

15
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,466
something just seems a
little different somehow.

16
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,266
Chi's gone back
to work at Tirol.

17
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,866
And she looks as happy as usual,
as if nothing had ever happened.

18
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,133
As if nothing had ever happened.

19
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,833
Hey, Motosuwa!

20
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,466
Is anything wrong?

21
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,733
Oh, I'm sorry,
that looks like it!

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,833
Okay, that does it.

23
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,233
Thanks a lot for all the help.

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,266
Well then Motosuwa,
see ya 'round.

25
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,700
Sure, I'll see you at school.

26
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,333
Yeah, something is different.

27
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:25,366
Something, enough to make me
want to find out more, I guess.

28
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,900
Excuse me, but why did you
put your hand on my head?!

29
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,800
So Sumomo and Kotoko
are the same size?

30
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,200
Aye! Sumomo's
16 centimeters tall!

31
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,300
That's not what I asked!

32
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, hi, this is Motosuwa.

33
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:43,733
I was just sort of wondering
how everything's going.

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,866
Yeah, I guess so.

35
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,800
Okay, I'll head on over. See ya.

36
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,133
Hideki, going out?

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,300
Yeah, I am.

38
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,600
You wanna come with me, Chi?

39
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,766
Chi will go with you!

40
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,900
So, Chi...

41
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:00,766
Chi?

42
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,033
I was wondering,
do you enjoy working?

43
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,800
Chi enjoys working.

44
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,100
What's so fun about it?

45
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,600
Chi works, Hideki is happy.

46
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,366
No, that's not what I meant.

47
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,733
You know, like the
stuff you do there;

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,433
do you have fun doing it?

49
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Chi prefers now more than work.

50
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,700
Huh?

51
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,766
Together with Hideki.
Chi has fun.

52
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,433
I see. Well, it's still
sorta strange to me.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,133
Even now, I just really don't
know that much about Persocoms.

54
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,366
But as far as I can see,
their owners really do seem

55
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,500
to be something
very special to them.

56
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,200
Or maybe it's just
that she was programmed

57
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,933
to be that way by
her previous owner.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,133
Chi?

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,833
This must be the destination!

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
This is the place!

61
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,833
This address is registered
in Sumomo's map data!

62
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,000
Is this correct?

63
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,066
Yeah.

64
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,500
This is Mr. Minoru
Kokubunji's house!

65
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,566
Yes?

66
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,966
Welcome, Mr. Motosuwa.

67
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,100
Oh, hello there, Yuzuki.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,800
Please come in.

69
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,566
This place amazes me every time.

70
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,566
Mr. Motosuwa.

71
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,566
I'm afraid we're
all busy right now,

72
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,633
so there's nobody
free to greet you.

73
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,633
Sorry about that.

74
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,066
But would you be so kind
to join me in my study?

75
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,733
Uh, sure.

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,666
Amazing.

77
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,866
A PA system in a house.

78
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,600
Oh, and please watch your step.

79
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,800
Huh?

80
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,233
What's this?

81
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:35,900
What are they doing?

82
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,633
They must be doing research.

83
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,133
Research.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,833
Please come in.

85
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,066
Hey.

86
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,766
Sorry to bug you
when you're so busy.

87
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,200
That's all right. I see
you brought Miss Chi.

88
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,600
Yeah, I was a little concerned

89
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,733
about leaving her at home alone.

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,900
Has anything else happened?

91
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,100
Oh, no, not at all;
nothing like that.

92
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,933
I see. Well, I'm glad.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,600
I think I'll take
a short break now.

94
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,100
You should rest, too, Yuzuki.

95
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,300
Thank you.

96
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,700
I've put together all my
research so far about Miss Chi.

97
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,833
I'm still working on it, though.

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,733
Oh, thank you.

99
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,100
I don't suppose you have a
quieter way to wait, do you?

100
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,600
Nope. This is how
I was programmed!

101
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,133
Even after all this,

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,500
I still don't have any idea
what kind of Persocom Chi is.

103
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,900
Until now, I didn't really
think it was such a big deal.

104
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,100
But someday,
if something like that

105
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,533
or even worse were to
ever happen to Chi again,

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
I wouldn't be able to
do anything about it.

107
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,133
I need to know.

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,933
I want to find out as
much as I possibly can.

109
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,066
If there's anything
I can do for you,

110
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,133
I'd be happy to help.

111
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,366
And about the contents
of this envelope...

112
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,133
From what I've pieced together

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,300
there seems to have
been a very hidden side

114
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,200
to the development
of the "chobits" series.

115
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,266
Hidden?

116
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, this goes deep in
the realm of Urban Legend,

117
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,100
so try to keep that in mind.

118
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,233
Intriguing story, though.

119
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,833
"Chobits," said to be
the ultimate Persocoms,

120
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,500
are also supposedly influenced
by a certain syndicate.

121
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,733
When Persocoms were
first being created,

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,766
it seems that there was
some sort of a disagreement

123
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,000
between the developers
of the Persocom

124
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,966
and their client, the syndicate.

125
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,233
The constant interference
from the syndicate

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,366
apparently made the developers
more and more irritated.

127
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,333
As a result,

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
unbeknownst to the syndicate,

129
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:38,000
the developers created
a special Persocom.

130
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,700
And that's--

131
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,500
"Chobits"?

132
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,500
That's right.

133
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,066
And from what
I can tell, it's serious,

134
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,766
because the existence
of "chobits" puts

135
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,933
the syndicate at a
severe disadvantage.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,066
So then, what's
their real purpose?

137
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,333
Well, I haven't gotten that far.

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
I see.

139
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm sorry, Motosuwa.

140
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:56,733
Huh?

141
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,300
Oh, you don't have
to apologize, Minoru.

142
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,833
You've been incredibly
helpful since all this started.

143
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,500
Nevertheless, the fact remains

144
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,166
that it was my carelessness that
got her kidnapped the other day.

145
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,400
So please allow me
to do whatever I can do

146
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,000
to help you, Motosuwa.

147
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,100
Minoru.

148
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,833
Well, no, actually,
I'd like two of you to be more-

149
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:17,833
Yuzuki!

150
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,700
I brought you some tea.

151
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,166
Why are you serving the tea?

152
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,266
The maid Persocom is currently
being used by the system.

153
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,533
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,833
Yuzuki, you're the center
of that system, aren't you?

155
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,933
Why don't you sit
down and take a rest?

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,233
I'm sure you're very
tired from all this.

157
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,400
Lord Minoru,

158
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,266
thank you very much.

159
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:46,466
I can handle this on my own;
I want you to try to relax.

160
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,533
Huh?

161
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,633
Minoru!

162
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,666
Lord Minoru?! Lord Minoru?!

163
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,166
Well, I'm glad to know
that all he really needs

164
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,700
is a good night sleep.

165
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:10,066
But to be so exhausted that
he'd just collapse like that...

166
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,766
Does that mean he hasn't
been getting any sleep lately?

167
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,700
Yes.

168
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,066
It must be because
of all the research

169
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,833
that I asked him to do for me.

170
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,833
Please, Mr. Motosuwa;
it isn't your fault.

171
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,133
I'm afraid that I'm just
not powerful enough.

172
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Don't say that!

173
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,700
There's no denying that if my
processing speed were faster,

174
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:33,833
I wouldn't have put Lord Minoru
under such extreme stress.

175
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,466
If only I was just...
more useful.

176
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,600
Miss Yuzuki.

177
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,600
If only there was some
way for me to do something.

178
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,366
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

179
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,800
Kojima?! What're you...?!

180
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,500
Boy, you've got a
lot of nerve, doncha?!

181
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,466
You creep!!

182
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:53,233
That hurt.

183
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,766
What the heck do you think
you're doing here? Huh?

184
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,166
Hey! Hold on a second, man!

185
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,500
"M" just wanted to borrow
my Persocoms, that's all!

186
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,900
"M"?

187
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes, it's true:

188
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,033
Lord Minoru asked for
some help with the research.

189
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,000
Mr. Kojima not only owns them,

190
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,366
but has a lot of
knowledge about Persocoms.

191
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,000
And I really do feel bad
about what I did the other day.

192
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,666
My curiosity just
got out of control.

193
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,833
So I'm helping out to
try to make up for it.

194
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,633
Oh yeah?

195
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,933
And how are you going to that?

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Well, you've heard
about the syndicate

197
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,066
that was involved
in the development

198
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,800
of the "chobits" series,
haven't you?

199
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:25,900
What about it?!

200
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:28,033
If you really
wanted to find out,

201
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,666
the easiest way is to hack
directly into the syndicate's

202
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,933
main computer and
have a look around.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,400
Hack into the...

204
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:38,866
And just what are
you trying to say?!

205
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,466
Do ya hafta get so upset?!

206
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,666
Hacking is a term, which means

207
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,566
to find your way
through security systems

208
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:47,000
and illegally enter a computer
without access privileges.

209
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,200
That's right, it basically means

210
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,600
that you're tapping into
someone else's computer.

211
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,533
Can you really do
something like that?

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
Absolutely.

213
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,033
At least we know who it
is that we're dealing with.

214
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,333
Then again, there's
always gonna be risks.

215
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,833
Risks? Like what?

216
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,033
We're not dealing
with an ordinary server.

217
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,300
There will definitely be

218
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,333
a lot of security walls
to get through.

219
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,433
You never know, they might
bring on a full system crash.

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,066
Wait, a crash is just...

221
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:15,033
It's when data gets lost, the
memory gets wiped out, you know.

222
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,966
And if it's really bad, the hard
drive can actually be destroyed.

223
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,233
Yeah, well that
sounds pretty awful!

224
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,433
You want to put Miss Yuzuki
through something like that?!

225
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,866
Hey, did I say that?! Come on.

226
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,966
Actually, "M" was
totally against it.

227
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,600
Lord Minoru was?

228
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,933
Yeah, it's true, When I
suggested that he just oughta

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,400
take a chance and
let Yuzuki hack into it,

230
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,300
he just suddenly...

231
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:37,200
Don't you ever say that again!

232
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,733
I won't let it go next time.

233
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,433
Well, nothing else is
gonna be as effective.

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,866
I know that!

235
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,433
I'm aware of that.

236
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,900
But I will never let
Yuzuki take that risk.

237
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,500
Lord Minoru.

238
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,533
I never expected that reaction.

239
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,566
It just wasn't like him.

240
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,500
I mean, "M" is usually
the first one to jump

241
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,800
at an opportunity for a
new piece of information.

242
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,033
It makes sense to me.

243
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,366
Miss Yuzuki is a lot more than
just another Persocom to Minoru.

244
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,100
So now, since we
can't go with that plan,

245
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,866
we're using methods that just
aren't getting us anywhere.

246
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,466
He's bound to end up
stressing himself right

247
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,300
over the edge at this rate.

248
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,600
Well to take some of
the strain off Minoru,

249
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,866
I suggest that you do your best
to figure out something else.

250
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:20,666
Got that?!

251
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:21,666
Huh?

252
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,666
You've gonna work twice,
no, three times as hard!

253
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,400
And I'm gonna be watching you,
so don't try to slack off!

254
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,200
I think we'll stay here tonight.

255
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,300
I'm still a bit worried
about Minoru anyway.

256
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,466
Hey, come on, man!

257
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,733
All right, so which
room are you working in?

258
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, okay, whatever
you say, just let go of me!

259
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,266
He's sleeping.

260
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,833
Back to work!

261
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,333
Don't forget, you were the
one who programmed me

262
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,833
so I wouldn't be able to
speak anything but the truth.

263
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,566
Yeah, I know. I'm working!

264
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,733
Kotoko. That's right, most
Persocoms don't tell lies.

265
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,300
That's because they
were programmed that way.

266
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,800
So then, when Miss Yuzuki...?

267
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,466
If only I was
just more useful...

268
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,900
So if that's the truth,

269
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:28,433
then there's something...

270
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:34,233
Miss Chi.

271
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,733
Hideki said to
check how things are.

272
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,233
Everything's fine
just at the moment.

273
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,933
Yuzuki?

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,700
That's Lord Minoru
with his elder sister.

275
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,933
Elder sister? Not Yuzuki?

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,666
That's right. I am different
from his elder sister.

277
00:13:56,733 --> 00:14:00,166
I was made to be just like her,
and I've been programmed

278
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,766
with a great deal of
data about her, too.

279
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,300
But I am simply not her.

280
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:08,700
His real elder sister would've

281
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:12,933
been much more helpful to
Lord Minoru, I'm afraid.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,966
Miss Chi, tell me:

283
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,766
if you knew that you needed
to help Mr. Motosuwa,

284
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,500
would you do
anything for him?

285
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,133
Anything for him?

286
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,800
For example,
would you do something

287
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:25,600
even if it could possibly
cause you to break?

288
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,500
Chi is always glad
when Hideki is happy.

289
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,400
If it made Hideki happy,

290
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,100
Chi would!

291
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,800
Yuzuki?

292
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,300
What the...?

293
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:05,133
What's with the Persocoms?

294
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
If the power keeps
fluctuating like that,

295
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,400
it could cause problems
with our operation.

296
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,800
All right, let's
see what's going on

297
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,366
with the house security system.

298
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,233
Hm?

299
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,066
What's wrong?

300
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,233
That's strange.

301
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,833
All the power in the house
is concentrated in one spot.

302
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,433
Looks like there's
someone using the system

303
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,866
in the study right now.

304
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,633
The study? Minoru's?

305
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,600
Hm?

306
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,966
All right, who's that
so late at night?

307
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,133
Someone's trying to get in.

308
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,633
Yeah.

309
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,666
Well, well, this is interesting:

310
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,033
someone's breaking
through my security system.

311
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,733
Whatta ya think? Is it her?

312
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,266
Nah, although I gotta admit it;
it's a pretty good Persocom.

313
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,366
I'm connecting.

314
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,266
Minoru! Are you in there?

315
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,700
Come on, the doctor
told you to take it easy!

316
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,100
What's going on?

317
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,400
Minoru?!

318
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:54,233
Huh? Then who's in the study?

319
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,366
I don't know; I'm the only one

320
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,733
who can use the system
in there, except...

321
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:03,100
Yuzuki! I know you're
in there; answer me!

322
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,100
Huh?

323
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,100
Yuzuki! Open the door!

324
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,466
Lord Minoru.

325
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,500
Yuzuki! What are you doing?!

326
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:12,933
Open this door!

327
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,966
Why would Yuzuki do something
like this without telling him?

328
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,100
Lord Minoru.

329
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,333
Miss Yuzuki?!

330
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,000
She's tied to the PA system.

331
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,333
Mr. Kojima said that
it might be possible

332
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,466
to hack into the
syndicate's server.

333
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,333
I am attempting to do so.

334
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,933
I am currently deciphering
the fifth password.

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,700
Yuzuki, as soon as
you crack the password,

336
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,266
the Security program
will kick in,

337
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,600
and you'll be targeted
immediately!

338
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,833
You see, I wasn't
able to understand

339
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,666
how you felt, Lord Minoru.

340
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,800
Yuzuki?

341
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:47,066
Even though you knew
this was the best way,

342
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,933
you were concerned about me,

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,766
and took it all upon
your own shoulders.

344
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,200
But, I'm sure that
your real elder sister

345
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,066
would have understood
completely.

346
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,666
What are you
talking about, Yuzuki?

347
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,566
Why are you doing this?

348
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,933
That's right, why would you
believe something like that?

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
Is it because you're
programmed with her data?

350
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,933
You believe it doesn't matter
what might happen to you,

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,233
as long as you do what
his sister would have done?

352
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Is that how she's
been programmed?

353
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:18,133
It just doesn't
seem right somehow.

354
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,700
I just want to be
helpful to Lord Minoru,

355
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,333
like his elder sister was.

356
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,833
No, Yuzuki; it's not the same.

357
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,633
It's not the same!

358
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,066
You're not my sister, Yuzuki!

359
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,700
Decryption complete.

360
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:38,166
Commencing data download.

361
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:53,900
Yuzuki, no!

362
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:56,966
The lock!

363
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,400
Yuzuki!

364
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:02,333
Yuzuki! Yuzuki!

365
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Boy, that's a rough
way to send 'em off.

366
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:11,633
I have no sympathy for anyone
who tries to enter Zima.

367
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,133
Why, if I didn't know better,

368
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,466
I'd say you sound
a little bit jealous.

369
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,166
Except that we're
Persocoms, of course.

370
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:22,766
Yuzuki.

371
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,100
You're awake.

372
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,466
Lord Minoru. Everyone.

373
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,100
No, don't get up.

374
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,766
Okay, I'm done with the tests.

375
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,866
It doesn't look like there was
any serious damage done to her.

376
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,066
That's good.

377
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,300
You gave us a real
shock, Miss Yuzuki.

378
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,133
You're pretty lucky this cable
burnt through as fast as it did.

379
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,366
I'm sorry to worry
you all like this.

380
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,200
I'll do a self-scan now.

381
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,733
Lord Minoru,

382
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,700
Yes?

383
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,433
I'm afraid some data
was lost in the crash.

384
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,766
Data about your elder sister.

385
00:18:58,566 --> 00:18:59,966
Minoru.

386
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,933
Could you please
re-enter the data

387
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,866
that pertains to your sister?

388
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:08,933
Anything else?

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,033
Huh?

390
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,933
It seems the rest of
my memories appearsto be fine.

391
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,666
I see.

392
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,833
Well, I won't enter
any data about her.

393
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,333
Huh?

394
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,333
When my sister died,

395
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,733
I wasn't able to
bring myself to accept it.

396
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,566
Actually, I didn't
want to accept it.

397
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:30,566
And that's why,
I made you, Yuzuki.

398
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,633
I tried to make you as much
like her as I could remember,

399
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,433
but you're not
my older sister, Yuzuki.

400
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:42,966
I'm terribly sorry, it's
because I'm not good enough.

401
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:43,966
That's not true.

402
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,700
Nobody could ever realy
take my sister's place.

403
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:49,966
And believe me, nobody
could replace you either.

404
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,233
Nobody could ever replace me?

405
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,666
That's right.

406
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,833
That can't be true;
I'm a Persocom.

407
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,533
Yes, but I could never think of

408
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,166
another Persocom the way
I think of you, Yuzuki.

409
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,333
And it doesn't
make any difference

410
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
that it's all
been programmed in.

411
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:07,033
Yuzuki is Yuzuki.

412
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,833
So I won't be entering any
more data about my sister.

413
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,366
The time I spent with
my sister is something

414
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:16,566
I'm sure I'll always
cherish deep in my heart.

415
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,466
But the times I've
spent with you, Yuzuki,

416
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:22,200
are very precious memories, too.

417
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,400
And that's why I want to
go right on making them.

418
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,733
Not as a replacement
for my sister.

419
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,000
I wanna spend time with you.

420
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,500
With Yuzuki.

421
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,700
I can stay by your side,
Lord Minoru,

422
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,766
even if I cannot be a
replacement for your sister?

423
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,166
That's exactly what
I'm trying to say,

424
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,466
Yuzuki: I want you by my side.

425
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,500
Lord Minoru.

426
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:55,566
Oh boy, how did it get
to be morning already?

427
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,266
Yuzuki.

428
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,333
Huh?

429
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,066
Yuzuki looked happy.

430
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,700
Yeah, she did.

431
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:02,366
Chi is happy too.

432
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,233
Hm?

433
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,166
Hideki, what are memories?

434
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,200
Oh, well, let's see...

435
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,766
They're special things that live
deep within the heart. I guess.

436
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,933
I mean, they're
really not like data;

437
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,266
you can't just replace
or reenter them.

438
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,800
Do Chi and Hideki have memories?

439
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,700
Oh, yeah!

440
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,233
Chi!

441
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:27,566
Things that can't easily
be reentered or replaced...

442
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,200
They're something... different.

443
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,200
Mr. Motosuwa.

444
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,733
Oh hi, Minoru,
is everything all right?

445
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm sorry to have
troubled you with all this.

446
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:39,433
No, no, please don't apologize.

447
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm the one who
asked for your help.

448
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,300
Don't worry about it.

449
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,033
I'll keep up the investigation.

450
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,166
Thank you.

451
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,733
But try not to get too
stressed out over it, okay?

452
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll try.

453
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:49,933
This might help.

454
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
Huh?

455
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:54,433
It's a compilation of the data
that Yuzuki managed to download.

456
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,700
Oh, I see.

457
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:58,500
I haven't had time to do more
than just skim over most of it,

458
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:01,333
but it's a list of the people
who developed the Persocom.

459
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,966
There was a picture that
may very well surprise you.

460
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,766
Miss Hibiya! Miss Hibiya!

461
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:10,900
Where could she be?

462
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:14,866
My guess is that she was
one of the main people

463
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,866
on the development team.

464
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:20,866
But, now I really
don't understand.

465
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
Miss Hibiya!

466
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:01,300
Hideki, when do you feel happy?

467
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:02,233
Let's see...

468
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,400
Well, when I eat a
really delicious meal.

469
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,766
Or when I get a good score
on a prep school exam

470
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,766
And, I guess, well, uh...

471
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,466
When you hold hands?

472
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:15,366
Well, yeah, I feel happy
when I hold hands, I guess.

473
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:18,033
But why are you
asking me that, Chi?

474
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,733
Chi.

475
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,733
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Wears, Then Takes Off."

476
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,033
Everyone is happy
when they hold hands!

477
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,266
Chi!
