1
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,900
Good afternoon, may I help-

2
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:04,466
Oh, hello, Motosuwa.

3
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:05,933
Hey there, nice to see you.

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,700
I came by to get Chi.
Is it time?

5
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:10,033
Yeah. Thanks for coming.

6
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
Chi, come on out!

7
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,133
Chi.

8
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
Hideki!

9
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:17,933
Hideki!

10
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Hey, Chi, calm down!

11
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,066
Hideki, look, look!

12
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,133
Huh?

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,300
Pretty good, huh?
Chi made it all by herself, too.

14
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,166
Huh?

15
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,666
Chi made that?

16
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,100
Chi is a very quick learner,

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,633
so I thought I'd let her try.

18
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,333
And I think she did
a really great job.

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,933
Yeah, that's great Chi.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Chi.

21
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,933
Please go ahead and
have some, if you'd like.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,733
Huh?

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,133
Are you sure it's all right?

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Of course.

25
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,933
Well great! Then I think I will.

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,000
Chi?

27
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,633
It's good!

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,233
This is delicious, Chi!

29
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,666
Chi!

30
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,966
This is really great!

31
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,733
Ah, you two seem to get
along so well together.

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,366
Oh, well...

33
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,200
Chi.

34
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,766
Oh, so she even learned
how to bake a cake, huh?

35
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,766
That's right!

36
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,366
Ya don't say...

37
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,933
You know, that could be handy.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,033
Maybe we can find a way

39
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,733
to teach ours to
make the appetizers.

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,366
I think we should
be able to do that.

41
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,533
Well, ya gotta admit...

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,466
These things are an
incredible invention.

43
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,733
They look just like humans,

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,066
they're really cute, and they
follow instructions to a "t."

45
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,066
They never give you any guff,

46
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,533
and they can do
just about anything.

47
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,500
Pretty much.

48
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,400
Hey Manager, the truck's here!

49
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:46,900
Oh, okay, just put
it in the back.

50
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,700
Come to think of it...

51
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,966
hey Yumi, didn't you
say you had a Persocom?

52
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,366
Ah, yes.

53
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,400
Well, that's a small one.

54
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,900
Oh, I had a human-shaped
Persocom for a while,

55
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:05,366
but I found that it
made me sort of sad.

56
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,166
It's true that Persocoms
can do all sorts of things.

57
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,766
In many ways, they're better
than humans will ever be.

58
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,700
There're a lot of 'em out there:

59
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,500
people who think Persocoms
are better than humans.

60
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:17,766
But, at this rate,

61
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,400
no one'll want to stay
by anyone's side anymore.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,333
I didn't mean to
get into all that.

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,533
Oh, it's okay.

65
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,433
"At this rate,

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,733
no one'll want to
stay by anyone's side."

67
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,333
Human beings and Persocoms...

68
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,166
It's morning!

69
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,800
It's morning! It's morning!

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,966
Aw man, is it really
time to get up?

71
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,400
Good morning, Hideki.

72
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,933
Oh, good morning.

73
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,333
Chi?

74
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,966
Let's start with the
wakey-wakey exercises today!

75
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,133
Why's this such a big
surprise to me every morning?!

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,033
I should've gotten
used to this by now!

77
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,233
She's a Persocom! A Persocom!

78
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,233
Chi.

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
You're so enthusiastic!

80
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:59,366
Ok! Leg exercises!

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,066
I'll be going now.

82
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,800
Take care of yourself.

83
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,700
Oh, yeah, about your
job at Tirol today...

84
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,900
Chi?

85
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:12,833
I have to go to the library
after prep school gets out,

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,000
so I don't think
I can make it in time

87
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,666
to walk you home.

88
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,866
You're gonna have to come home

89
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,700
by yourself this time
if you don't mind.

90
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:19,533
Is that okay?

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,533
Hideki.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,766
Hm?

93
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,533
Hideki tired? Out of energy?

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,333
Huh?

95
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,700
Too much exercise?

96
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,133
No, I think it's a bit
more complicated than that.

97
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,166
Hideki sick?

98
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,366
No, it's not like that.

99
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,533
It's just a little early
for that much stimula-

100
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
No! I-

101
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,066
It's all right.

102
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,933
I'm not sick or anything.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,833
Hideki sure?

104
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,666
Positive.

105
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,433
So don't worry
about it; I'm fine.

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,166
Chi is glad.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Oh, Chi.

108
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:02,000
That makes Chi very glad.

109
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,733
Uh, hey!

110
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,133
When Chi thought
Hideki was sick...

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,633
Chi's heart felt like
it was twisted tightly.

112
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,166
Chi.

113
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:37,333
Time to go; time to go!

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,566
Time to zoom out
of the house now,

115
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,633
gotta get going!

116
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,933
Yeah, um, well, at any rate...

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,533
I'll be going now!

118
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,966
Hideki.

119
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,266
What am I doing;
am I out of my mind?

120
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,033
But Chi is so
innocent and honest.

121
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,400
What am I supposed to do?

122
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,133
She looked like she
felt so badly, and...

123
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,466
Anyway, she's very-- 

124
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,866
In many ways,

125
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,066
they're better than
humans will ever be.

126
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,933
There're a lot of 'em out there:

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,900
people who think Persocoms
are better than humans.

128
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,100
But, at this rate...

129
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,833
But after a while,

130
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,400
her husband only seemed
interested in the Persocom.

131
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,233
Miss Shimizu's husband
got all obsessed

132
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,166
with Persocoms too.

133
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,266
At first, I wondered
if something

134
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,500
like that was really possible.

135
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,833
But it's happening
more and more.

136
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:51,066
I admit that Chi is really cute.

137
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:54,366
When I look at her,
my heart races,

138
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,233
and I can't help smiling.

139
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:00,200
But, she's not human.

140
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:07,300
Still, I- I can't think of Chi
as just a Persocom anymore.

141
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:10,933
So, how am I supposed
to think of her?

142
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,133
No one'll want to stay by
anyone's side anymore.

143
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,266
Chi goes to work,
making sure Chi isn't late.

144
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,100
Chi?

145
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,566
Continues from other book...

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,766
Ch-

147
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,033
I just can't take it!

148
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,133
I need to get ready
for my entrance exams;

149
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,866
I don't have time to
think about relationships

150
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,200
between humans and Persocoms!

151
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,566
Well, there's nothing I can do

152
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,833
about it now anyway.

153
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,600
Besides, if I let
myself get all worried,

154
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,433
I'm just gonna wind up
getting Chi worried too.

155
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:45,900
Hm?

156
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,833
I'm home.

157
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,533
Chi?

158
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,666
Well that's strange...

159
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:01,066
She should have gotten
off work ages ago.

160
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,300
Telephone! Telephone!

161
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,600
Please answer the telephone!
Please answer the telephone!

162
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,600
That's right.

163
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,200
I forgot that Minoru
helped me set it up

164
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,300
so my home phone
would forward calls directly

165
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,133
to Sumomo when I wasn't in.

166
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,900
Go ahead, Sumomo.

167
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,466
Aye!

168
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,266
I'm sorry to call so late.

169
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,266
Is this the Motosuwa residence?

170
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,466
Manager Ueda.

171
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,766
Oh, Mr. Motosuwa.

172
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,133
You've got great timing.

173
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,533
I was worried about Chi.

174
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Huh?

175
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,766
Well, I was wondering
what had happened to her.

176
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,766
Huh?

177
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,566
Actually she never came
in to work today at all.

178
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,566
I was getting worried,
so I decided to call.

179
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:37,866
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,433
Are you saying she
never even showed up?

181
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah. That's right.

182
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:46,100
Hey, Mr. Motosuwa?

183
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,066
I'm sorry!
I'll call you back later!

184
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,166
Wah!

185
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,466
Mr. Motosuwa? Mr. Motosuwa?!

186
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,300
Miss Manager! Miss Manager!

187
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,866
She's not home.

188
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,433
It certainly looks that way.

189
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:29,666
Where are you going?

190
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,133
Where could she be?

191
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,533
I hope she's not
mixed up in something

192
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,133
like that peep show again.

193
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,266
She's just so innocent;

194
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,333
I can't help thinking
something's gotta be up.

195
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,733
Oh, hey, you're
the guy who bought

196
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,733
the other books of
that series, aren't you?

197
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,133
Uh, yeah.

198
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,733
Yeah, you were in a while ago

199
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,066
with that little
long-haired Persocom.

200
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,166
Yeah, that was me.

201
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,200
Well anyway, this morning,

202
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,433
I saw her taking
a look at the new one.

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,333
And I thought I might just
say "hi" and talk with her.

204
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,666
But I was in the
middle of something,

205
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,133
and before I knew it,
she was gone.

206
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,166
She was gone?

207
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,833
Well, actually to
tell you the truth,

208
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,866
I am missing one
of those books now.

209
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,533
Oh, that's right,
I almost forgot.

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,366
I found this, lying on the
ground right over there.

211
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,033
Chi.

212
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Where is this?

213
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,433
Somewhere Chi doesn't know.

214
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:38,000
This is not Hideki's room.

215
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,333
Why is Chi in a
place Chi doesn't know?

216
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,500
You were kidnapped, that's why.

217
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:49,800
Chi?

218
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,800
Chi was "kidnapped"?

219
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,366
It means that you've
been abducted,

220
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,333
...taken against your will!

221
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,166
So Chi was abducted?

222
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,866
Should Chi like that?

223
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,400
What's that supposed to be?

224
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,800
Some kinda punch line
from a comedy routine?

225
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,000
Chi?

226
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,900
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

227
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,300
Boy, oh boy.

228
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,200
You really don't know much
of anything, do you?

229
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,666
Chi doesn't understand
many things.

230
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,133
Hideki always teaches Chi.

231
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,066
Hideki?

232
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,300
Yes, Hideki.

233
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,900
Hideki picked up
Chi from the garbage.

234
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,633
Hideki took Chi
back to his apartment.

235
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Hideki teaches Chi
all sorts of things.

236
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,666
I knew you had to
be the same Persocom.

237
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:42,333
Who's that?

238
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,433
Yoshiyuki Kojima.

239
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,566
Yoshiyuki Kojima.

240
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,366
Just call me Yoshiyuki.

241
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,900
Where is this?

242
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,633
You're at my place.

243
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,200
Yoshiyuki's place?

244
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,633
That's right.

245
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,500
Just now this thing was--

246
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:58,600
How dare you!

247
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,566
What do you mean by
calling me "this thing"?!

248
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,700
I have a proper name, you know!

249
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,566
My name is Kotoko,
do you understand?

250
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,333
Chi understands.

251
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
This thing is Kotoko.

252
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,133
That's not right;
I keep telling you:

253
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I'm not a thing,
so stop saying it!

254
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,366
I guess you really
don't understand

255
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,166
anything yet, do you?

256
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,500
Chi is here because
Yoshiyuki kidnapped Chi?

257
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,166
"Because you were kidnapped"?

258
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,566
I guess you could say that.

259
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,433
But why do you say that?

260
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,633
From the very first moment
that I found out you existed,

261
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,000
I've never stopped
thinking about you.

262
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:39,500
I finally found you.

263
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,333
And in the bookstore,
when I saw you standing there,

264
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,566
I knew immediately
that it had to be you.

265
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going to start
analyzing you now.

266
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,900
Because you must be
a more special entity.

267
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,100
Yes...

268
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:57,700
You could very well be
one of the Chobits series.

269
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,033
Chobits series? So Chi is...

270
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,433
What's Chi?

271
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
Chi is Chi.

272
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,433
Chi is the name
Hideki gave to Chi.

273
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,233
Yeah, but why "Chi"?

274
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,133
In the beginning,

275
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,266
the only thing Chi
could say was "chi."

276
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:18,466
That sounds like
the kind of name

277
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,066
you'd give to a dog or a cat.

278
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,400
Anyway, I'll analyze you

279
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,166
and tell you
what you really are.

280
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:32,233
If you need anything,

281
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,800
feel free to tell Kotoko,

282
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,533
and I'm sure she
can take care of it.

283
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,633
Okay, I'll see you later.

284
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:43,300
But...

285
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,233
Hm?

286
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,600
"Chi" is the name
that Hideki gave Chi.

287
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,900
Hideki gave this name to Chi...

288
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:56,433
Hideki gave, that's
why Chi loves this name.

289
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:06,566
Oh?

290
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,566
I'm sorry, Chi.

291
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,966
I made a promise that
I wouldn't do anything.

292
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,200
A promise I made to him.

293
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,700
I never expected that something

294
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,200
like this would come up.

295
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,166
Well, I failed again.

296
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,900
No matter how many times I trace

297
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:22,600
the sender of this image,
it's always a dead end.

298
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,766
Whoever it is, they've
done an awfully good job.

299
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,400
Huh?

301
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:29,500
I don't believe it's possible

302
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,966
for my present
configuration to handle this,

303
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,733
so I'll stop.

304
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,600
It's not your fault, Yuzuki.

305
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm afraid I'm just not
experienced enough.

306
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,500
But then, I was made
to be helpful to you,

307
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:43,033
and if I can't do what
you ask me, I'm not.

308
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,233
To think that I can't
do what I'm asked to do.

309
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,500
Huh? Lord Minoru?

310
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,433
You are very helpful
to me, Yuzuki.

311
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
So much so in fact,

312
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,833
that sometimes it
actually troubles me.

313
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,666
When you were much
younger, Lord Minoru,

314
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,633
if anything ever made
you sad for a while,

315
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,000
your sister was
always right here,

316
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,733
to do something like this.

317
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:08,100
Yuzuki.

318
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:08,966
It's been a while

319
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,533
since the last
maintenance was done,

320
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,133
but there still hasn't
been any new data entered

321
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,433
regarding your elder sister.

322
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,366
In order for me
to be closer to her

323
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,100
and serve you better,
Lord Minoru,

324
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,966
please enter more
data about your sister.

325
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,433
You know I-

326
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,966
Lord Minoru?

327
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,266
A telephone call.

328
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:32,966
Who is it?

329
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,566
It's Mr. Motosuwa.

330
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,133
At this time of night?

331
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,333
Connect me.

332
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,233
Connecting.

333
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,833
Minoru! I can't
find Chi; she's gone!

334
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
She disappeared;
I don't know what happened!

335
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,033
That sounds serious.

336
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,533
Do you have any leads?

337
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,466
There was a guy at the bookstore
who found her hairclip,

338
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,033
but somehow she just
suddenly disappeared!

339
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,166
I looked all over for her,

340
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,100
and I can't find
any sign of her.

341
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:58,066
Shinbo's not around,

342
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,433
so I don't know what to do.

343
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,566
You're the only one
I can turn to, Minoru!

344
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,466
Okay, try to calm
down, Motosuwa!

345
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,466
I don't know.

346
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,966
I've just got a really
bad feeling about this!

347
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:06,833
Yeah, I understand.

348
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,333
Just meet me at the Duklyon.

349
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
I'll be right over.

350
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,300
The connection has
been terminated.

351
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,633
I'm going out now.

352
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,633
There's a chance I might
need to look something up

353
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,566
when I'm out with
Motosuwa later on.

354
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,033
Would you like to come with me?

355
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,700
Sure.

356
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,833
Yuzuki, you always seem

357
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,733
to have the same exact
smile on your face

358
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,033
whenever we're going to
do something together.

359
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,133
It's because I know I'll be
by your side, Lord Minoru.

360
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:40,833
Well, shall we go?

361
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,966
Yes.

362
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,600
Chi.

363
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:51,066
But after a while,

364
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,733
her husband only seemed
interested in the Persocom.

365
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,433
Do you find
Persocoms attractive?

366
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,400
Is it more fun to be

367
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,700
with a Persocom
than with a human?

368
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:04,933
No one'll want to stay by
anyone's side anymore.

369
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,633
That's beside the point;

370
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,666
I still have to look for Chi.

371
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:10,733
Let's go, Sumomo!

372
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,866
Aye!

373
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,366
Chi, please be alright!

374
00:23:58,766 --> 00:23:59,533
Okay.

375
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,666
Let's say my wallet disappears.

376
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,566
The missing wallet's
not gonna be worried

377
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,833
or lonely or anything like that.

378
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,600
And, of course, contents aside,

379
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,366
I'm not gonna be worried
about the wallet either.

380
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,466
Chi is a Persocom.

381
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,366
She might not feel
doubt or loneliness.

382
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:19,700
But not me; I'm super
worried about her!

383
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:23,566
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Waits."

384
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,333
Is something wrong with me?
