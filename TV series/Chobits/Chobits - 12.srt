1
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,633
Wow! For real?!

2
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,766
I can really borrow
your DVD player?!

3
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,900
Man, this is great,
thank you so much!

4
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:56,766
Yeah, well.

5
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,133
You're about that
age now, Motosuwa.

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,433
You have needs.

7
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,166
You know?

8
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,233
Huh...

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,133
But um, keep this
quiet from Yumi, okay?

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,966
I promise. I will.

11
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,400
The little shop near
the train station

12
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,866
has plenty of good titles.

13
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,666
And, all this week, they're
having a sale- 20 to 50% off!

14
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,000
For real?!

15
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,200
Also...

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,500
And...

17
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:18,600
Ohh!

18
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,600
That's not all.

19
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,833
Oh, Senpai!

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,433
Waah!

21
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,933
Oh, what's going on, Dad?

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,733
Are you lending
that to my senpai?

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,500
Uh, yeah. I am!

24
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,733
He-he said he didn't have
a DVD player, so I, uh...

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,500
Oh, I see...

26
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:37,366
So, what kind of
things you gonna watch?

27
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,333
Well, let's see, um...

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,666
Probably action flicks.

29
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,000
Or maybe they have those shows

30
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,400
to help me with English.

31
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,166
And all sorts of...

32
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,233
That's right!

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,000
You're going to be watching
all sorts of things!

34
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,533
Yeah. I am!

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,666
Hm?

36
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,733
Come to think of it,

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,666
if it's a DVD it ought
to be really easy

38
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,300
to choose the good scenes.

39
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:03,566
And, I guess I won't
have to rewind it.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
Okay, which one should I go for?

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,366
Oh yeah. Oo-la-la.

42
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,166
This one looks good.

43
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Motosuwa.

44
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,700
Wah!

45
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,400
It's good to see you
again, Mr. Motosuwa.

46
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:35,433
Well, if it isn't
Minoru and Yuzuki!

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,533
What a surprise!

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
What are the two of you
doing in a place like this?

49
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,000
We're here to buy a new net-game

50
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,533
that just came out today.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,900
A new net-game?

52
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,366
It's an online game.

53
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,900
A game where you
use the Internet

54
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,266
to play with many
different people.

55
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,933
You can play games
on the Internet?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes.

57
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,133
You can play with
many other people,

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,633
and you can also play
along with your Persocom.

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,600
What?

60
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,833
So you mean that Chi
and I can play together?

61
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,800
That's right.

62
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,433
If you have the
hardware and software,

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,433
all you need to do is to connect
your Persocom and you can play.

64
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,333
Oh wow, imagine that!

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,833
To play a game with Chi...

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,133
Would you like
to play this game?

67
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I'll give you one if you like.

68
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,100
This is a special promo package,

69
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,100
and comes with an
extra game disc.

70
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,033
Wow! Oh yeah, that's cool.

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,200
But I don't have any hardware...

72
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,000
You have a DVD player there.

73
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,566
You can play net-games on that.

74
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,866
Huh, really?!

75
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,066
Certainly.

76
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,833
I'll go on ahead to the checkout
and pay for these things.

77
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,266
You can look for
DVDs of that nature

78
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,300
as much as you want,
Mr. Motosuwa,

79
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,366
Thanks!

80
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:35,300
What?

81
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,600
Wait, I uh, you've
got it all wrong!

82
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,233
I wasn't really actually
gonna get one 'o these.

83
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,666
Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,466
Hideki, what is this for?

85
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,666
Oh, that's software
for a net-game.

86
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,633
I borrowed it today from Minoru.

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,666
Borrowed from Minoru?

88
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,466
Yeah. It's a game you can play

89
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,433
with all kinds of different
people using the Internet.

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,066
Can play with all
kinds of people.

91
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:12,400
Can Chi and Hideki play, too?

92
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,266
Oh, yeah.

93
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,833
He said you and
I could play together.

94
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,766
Together with Hideki.

95
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:19,666
Whew.

96
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,500
There, I'm all done setting up!

97
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,800
Alright, Chi, do you wanna
play the net-game with me?

98
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,900
It'll be lots of fun.

99
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,700
Yes!

100
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,533
Chi will play the net-game
together with Hideki!

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,033
Okay!

102
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,033
There you go!

103
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,666
And here we go!

104
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:47,533
Game, game, play with Hideki!
Game, game, play with Hideki!

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,500
Whoa calm down!

106
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,600
Alright Chi, we'll get
started right away.

107
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,766
Chi!

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Hm? Connect to the network?

109
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,666
Huh? Login ID?

110
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:04,100
Hm?

111
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,000
Hmm...

112
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,733
Chi?

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
Oh, Mr. Motosuwa...

114
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,666
Good to hear from you.

115
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,600
Have you tried out
that game yet?

116
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,733
Well I'm trying.

117
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,233
But when I look at
the instruction manual,

118
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,933
it's full of things I don't
understand.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,900
So I can't seem to get started.

120
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,266
The screen says
something about needing

121
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,700
a login ID and some
sort of password.

122
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,033
Oh, I see.

123
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,133
Have you gotten yourself
an e-mail account yet?

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,066
Well, no.

125
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,400
I don't have anything like that.

126
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,633
Just as I thought.

127
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,466
Mr. Motosuwa,
I'm afraid you can't play

128
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,966
a net-game unless you sign up

129
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,233
with an internet
service provider

130
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,966
and get set up with
an e-mail account.

131
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:40,366
What?! Really?
Well, what do I do?

132
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,633
Where do I sign up?!

133
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,666
At the back of the
instructions manual,

134
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,266
they should have a phone
number for a service provider.

135
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,066
Just try hooking up
to that number directly

136
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,566
from your screen.

137
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:50,666
Got it!

138
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,666
Wha...? That's strange...

139
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,233
What do you mean? What's wrong?

140
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,733
It says, "unable to
connect due to user error."

141
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,166
Well, of course it does.

142
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,066
Mr. Motosuwa, you're
using your phone line

143
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,500
to talk to me right now.

144
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,033
Uh...

145
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,500
Well then, I guess
I'll just try to do it

146
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,500
by reading the
instruction manual!

147
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,066
All right. Good luck.

148
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,100
It looks like it's
going to be quite

149
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,300
a while before he
gets the game started.

150
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,700
Huh?

151
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,366
There's a license fee
to play this game?!

152
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,966
What the...?!

153
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,866
They want 1,000 yen a month?!

154
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:28,866
Oh!

155
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,900
It says right here that
the first month is free.

156
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,333
Huh? I don't get it.

157
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,066
I wonder what a
broadband adaptor is.

158
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, well.

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,833
Huh! Wrong password?!
I don't understand!!

160
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,233
Let's see now...
How about if I...

161
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,466
It's awfully bold of him
to sleep in class.

162
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,566
I really don't know what to say.

163
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:55,900
Agh! I got another
wrong password again.

164
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,166
You know you really
could've at least

165
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,233
done the basic network
set up by yourself.

166
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,366
I'm sorry!

167
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,733
I tried to read the manual,

168
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,666
but I just didn't
understand it at all.

169
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,166
Here you go. It's done.

170
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,200
Huh?

171
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,866
So you mean that it's
already connected up?

172
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:13,800
That's right.

173
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,733
Chi and Hideki can
play game together now?

174
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,900
It looks that way.

175
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:20,166
I should've asked
Shinbo to help us

176
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,433
right from the beginning.

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, I guess we should go
ahead and get started then.

178
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,900
Chi.

179
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,200
Have fun! See ya.

180
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,200
Good night! Enjoy the game!

181
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,866
Hey! Wait!
Don't go back home yet!

182
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,000
You should stay and
play with us for a while!

183
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:33,933
What?

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,066
I was thinking about checking up

185
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,400
on the prep school course
materials for tomorrow...

186
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,666
One day off can't hurt!

187
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:39,966
It's just a little breather!

188
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,100
Come on, Shinbo, sit down!

189
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,400
Let's play, alright?

190
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:44,400
Uh...

191
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,333
Geez, you're really
hopeless, you know that?

192
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
You're really hopeless!

193
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,533
Chi, you ready?

194
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,733
Chi.

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,933
All right!

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,433
Start the game!

197
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,433
Wow! Here I am! How cool!

198
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,966
Jump! Jump!

199
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:05,900
Look- a sword!

200
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:08,166
Hey, it even changes
facial expressions!

201
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,266
This game is amazing!

202
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,400
Man, you're such a newbie.

203
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,400
This game reacts to the
sound our voices and changes

204
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,900
the facial expressions
and actions accordingly.

205
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,566
Waah! Miss Shimizu!
I'm so sorry!

206
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,666
I'll stop playing the
game right away! I promise!

207
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,866
You idiot. It's me. Shinbo!

208
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,700
Huh? Shinbo?

209
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,666
How come your character looks
exactly like Miss Shimizu?

210
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,466
It's just a coincidence.

211
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,166
I made this character in a rush.

212
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,300
Huh...

213
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:36,900
But, that face with that voice,
is really kinda weird.

214
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,266
I'm sorry you had to wait!

215
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,200
Now, let's head out
to the adventure!

216
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:41,633
Why's she so huge?

217
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,100
You get to choose your own size
when you create a character.

218
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,300
Yeah! I can see that!

219
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,233
Huh?

220
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,566
What's wrong?

221
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,533
Chi... Chi's not here!

222
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,466
Chi!

223
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,066
Where are you!! Chi!!

224
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,266
Hey, Chi?! What's wrong?!

225
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,000
Where did you go?!

226
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:03,966
She won't answer.

227
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:05,233
When a computer
is playing a game

228
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,000
it always shuts down every
other program and function.

229
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,066
I didn't know that.

230
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,900
Well then, tell me
what happened to Chi?

231
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,333
Why is Chi the only one
of us that's not here?!

232
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,766
I'm sure that she just somehow

233
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,800
got connected to a
different server.

234
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,033
Well, looks like you finally
got connected, Mr. Motosuwa.

235
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,733
Oh, Minoru.

236
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,833
Let me explain.

237
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,933
This game uses a whole
bunch of different servers

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,733
in order to limit
the number of people

239
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,400
that can play together
simultaneously in each city.

240
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,366
In other words,

241
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:33,400
the city we're in is
probably already full,

242
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,366
so there is a distinct
possibility that Miss Chi

243
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,766
was forced to enter
the game in another city.

244
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,166
That is a huge problem!

245
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,500
I have to hurry up
and find her then!

246
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,066
Calm down, would you?

247
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,433
Look, I said there
are other cities,

248
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,700
but you've got to
realize that there

249
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,833
are 20 servers always working,

250
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,666
and each server contains
at least 15 cities,

251
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,433
for a total of--

252
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,800
Listen, I don't care about that!

253
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,400
I can't leave Chi
wandering all by herself

254
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,566
through some game!

255
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,733
I've gotta to go!

256
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,033
Oh, sorry about that.

257
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,333
You know, you complete
newbies are so...

258
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,066
You're a guy?

259
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,966
It gets so much harder
to play this game

260
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,933
when people like you
decide to show up.

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,733
So, please, try not to do
anything strange, will you?

262
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
W-What was that?!

263
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,066
It's alright, Mr. Motosuwa.

264
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,800
After all, it's not
like this game

265
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,666
was created especially for you.

266
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:20,433
There should be freedom for
anyone who wishes to play it.

267
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,966
So, I suppose that you'll
always to be an idealist.

268
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,500
Right, Kokubunji?

269
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,600
Wait a minute.
Do you know who I am?

270
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,233
You are pretty famous
on the net you know.

271
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,266
Well, I'll leave you to
get better acquainted

272
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,633
with all the newbies!

273
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,100
Bye, bye!

274
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,366
What's up with that guy?!

275
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,500
Unfortunately there
are mannerless people

276
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,000
like that all over the net.

277
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,733
I hope I don't run into them.

278
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,666
Wait, I don't have
time for this right now.

279
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:49,733
I've gotta get going!

280
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,366
Chi! I'm coming!

281
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,666
Hey wait, Motosuwa, stop!

282
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:57,766
Chi! Chi, where are you?!

283
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,400
Chi! Where are you?! Chi!

284
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:12,966
Hang on, Chi!
I'm coming to find you!

285
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,666
Outta my way!

286
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,533
Huh?

287
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,700
Hey, wait! It's unfair
to attack me like that!

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,100
Huh?

289
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,266
I guess you didn't
know that swords

290
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,766
don't work against them.

291
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,133
You should read the instruction
manual more carefully!

292
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,166
Oh, so that was it.

293
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,566
Can it be that this
is the first time

294
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,566
you've played this sort of game?

295
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,700
That's right,
it's my first time.

296
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,500
When I was in high school,

297
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,033
I was busy taking care of cows
and didn't have time for games.

298
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,533
Then going out on
adventure by yourself

299
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,066
is way too much for
you! It's reckless!

300
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,766
You'd be a fool to try it!

301
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,866
Shut up!

302
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:04,900
Hey! That's why we're
telling you not to go alone!

303
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,933
I know that there
are plenty more

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,533
dangerous monsters around!

305
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,400
And that's all the more reason
I can't leave Chi alone!

306
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:14,400
But it's only a game.

307
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,300
That's right, it's only a game.

308
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:22,700
No! Get way from me!!

309
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:25,066
Leave me alone! No!

310
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:34,500
Hm?

311
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,366
Wah!

312
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,300
Aah! Hot!

313
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,166
Ah, he's really is
a newbie, isn't he?

314
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,733
This really is too much to bear!

315
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,033
It's totally reckless!
He's really acting stupid!

316
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,033
Shut up!

317
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,300
I-I couldn't find her
after all that work.

318
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:09,700
The game is now over.
Good job today.

319
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,066
Chi.

320
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,200
Chi?

321
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,366
Oh hey, Chi.

322
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,000
Where were you in the game?

323
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,033
Chi does not know.

324
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,033
But, Chi heard Hideki's voice.

325
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,533
You mean you could hear me?

326
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Yes, but Chi was not
together with Hideki.

327
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,666
Hey I know!

328
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,400
How about we play
again tonight, Chi!

329
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,733
This time, I'm sure
we can play together!

330
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,300
Chi!

331
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,166
Good morning!

332
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,466
Oh yeah, right.

333
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,900
Good morning.

334
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,766
Have a good day you two.

335
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh, I don't believe it.

336
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,200
They both have got some
nerve sleeping in class again.

337
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,066
Oh, Chi, where did you go?

338
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,266
This isn't good.

339
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,966
I ended up falling asleep
during class again today.

340
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,533
Am I really going to make it

341
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,133
through the entrance
exams like this?

342
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,166
Hey, Motosuwa.

343
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,033
Hm?! Yes?

344
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,133
It's my pleasure!

345
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,633
Mm-hm So, how was it?

346
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,333
Huh?

347
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,700
Are you enjoying it?

348
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,666
Uh...

349
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:18,866
What are you talking about?

350
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,866
You know, the DVDs!

351
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,100
You don't look like
you've had any sleep.

352
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,733
Have you been up all night
watching them you dog?

353
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,233
Uh, no! I haven't had
the chance to buy any.

354
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,066
You what?!

355
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,700
You haven't even
watched any yet?!

356
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:31,933
That won't do!

357
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
You can borrow these!

358
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,133
Sir, are these what
I think they are?

359
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,266
Yeah, they're from
my private collection!

360
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,666
You can return them
whenever you want.

361
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,133
Wow! Oh thank you!

362
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,666
Hey there! What are
you guys doing?

363
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,433
Waah!

364
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Oh, I see you've got some DVDs!

365
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,833
What kind of movies
did you borrow, Senpai?

366
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,966
Action flicks!
Yeah, that's right!

367
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,100
I borrowed some action flicks!

368
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,833
Yeah! Those are from
my private collection

369
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,533
of special action flicks!

370
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,600
Hm?

371
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:04,166
Oh boy.

372
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,566
I'm sure that Chi
is looking forward

373
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,566
to playing that
game again tonight.

374
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,200
This time, I'm sure
we can play together!

375
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,200
Chi!

376
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,533
Of course I did say that.

377
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I really can't be playing games
every single night of my life.

378
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,833
All right!

379
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,566
I feel bad for Chi, but I'll
get a good night's rest tonight,

380
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,566
and study hard
starting tomorrow!

381
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:28,433
Magical... Life Healing...
Player Items...

382
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,933
I'm home, Chi!

383
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,033
Welcome home, Hideki!

384
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
Play game again today!

385
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:36,666
This time, together with Hideki!

386
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,133
Uh... Yeah, okay I guess.

387
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,233
Uh, explain to me why
it is we're here again?

388
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,166
Aw, come on Shinbo,
it's gonna be fun!

389
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,733
I mean, the more
the merrier, right?

390
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,966
And today, Chi is going
to be with us, too.

391
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,033
Chi.

392
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,900
Okay, let's start the game!

393
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,633
Huh?

394
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,833
Ah!

395
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Where is Chi! Why isn't
she with us again?!

396
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,266
This is pretty strange.

397
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,166
The server really isn't
all that crowded today.

398
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,933
Maybe it isn't the
number of people.

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then where is she?

400
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,633
Is she in some other city again?

401
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,233
There are cases
in which a computer

402
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,733
will not be allowed
to play the game

403
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,700
if the task-handling skills of
the computer are too high

404
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,866
and puts extra
pressure on the servers!

405
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,933
Darn!

406
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,900
Hey, wait!

407
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,766
Hey Chi! Hey Chi!
Where are you?!

408
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,366
Don't worry! I'm coming!

409
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,533
Warning, warning!
Danger! Danger!

410
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,800
Do not act alone!
Repeat: do not act alone!

411
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, shut up!

412
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,166
No, that's not it!

413
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,333
You can't go that way!

414
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,300
Darn it! Take that you...

415
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,533
Ugh!

416
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,866
That's why I keep telling you
to not to use magic so much!

417
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,366
Wait for me, Chi!

418
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,566
Hi... de... ki.

419
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,166
Wha...

420
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,500
What the heck is that thing?

421
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,933
That thing is the boss monster!

422
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,666
We'll never be able
to defeat him.

423
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,300
Why? Is he really that strong?

424
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:27,866
Yeah. I've seen info in
magazines and on the web.

425
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,133
Nobody has been able
to defeat him yet.

426
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
Warning, warning!
Danger, danger!

427
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:36,233
Everyone, please
evacuate immediately!!

428
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
But if we can
get by him somehow,

429
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,533
we can go on to
the next city, right?

430
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,166
Hey wait, are you serious?

431
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,233
Don't do it.

432
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,233
There's no way you can
win against this guy.

433
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,266
Yeah but...

434
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,233
Chi might...

435
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Chi might be somewhere
waiting for me!

436
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,966
Motosuwa!

437
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh man, that guy is hopeless!

438
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:03,900
Sumomo!

439
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,166
Aye!

440
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:08,466
Carbonara!

441
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:09,366
Chorizo!

442
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,233
Ahh!!

443
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,633
Ahh!

444
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,666
Ah, man. We're finished already?

445
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,333
Chi!

446
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,766
Chi? Is that you?

447
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:33,533
Chi? Chi? Is it you?

448
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,633
Dah! Hey! Hey wait minute!

449
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,600
Chi was right there!

450
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,666
I was touching her hand!

451
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:53,933
Hey, rewind it, will ya?!

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,100
What are you talking about?

453
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,466
This isn't a
videotape, you know.

454
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,633
But, that light.

455
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,966
I wonder what it was?

456
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,900
It sure did seem like Chi...

457
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,500
The game is over!

458
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,733
Good job everyone!

459
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,333
Chi?

460
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,366
That was great, Chi!

461
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,500
You totally defeated
the boss monster!

462
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,900
Chi doesn't remember anything.

463
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:16,900
Huh?

464
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,400
What do you mean by that?

465
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,533
Chi?

466
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Chi, started out missing,

467
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,166
but then she appeared
as a different character

468
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,600
and defeated the
invincible boss monster.

469
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,433
Perhaps that means
that Miss Chi has

470
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,000
so much task-handling power

471
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,400
that she surpasses
the game servers?

472
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:36,333
Well, if that's really the
case, her CPU is on par

473
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,800
with the fastest
supercomputers ever built.

474
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,266
Hideki, no more games tonight?

475
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,100
No, Chi, we've already
finished this one,

476
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,366
and it would be really bad

477
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,433
if I lost track of
you in a game again.

478
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,800
Chi could not play game
together with Hideki.

479
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:59,233
Hey, how 'bout we play
a different game then!

480
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,833
One where we don't have
to connect to the internet!

481
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,333
Chi.

482
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,033
Chi?

483
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,266
Here. Different game.

484
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,100
That's not a game!

485
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,866
Hideki, let's play
this together!

486
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,666
C-Chi! Don't! Please!
That's not a game!

487
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:18,800
Not a game?

488
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,933
Um, well, no it's...

489
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,866
What is it?

490
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:23,766
Wah!

491
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,566
Don't make it into college

492
00:23:58,633 --> 00:23:59,833
and you have no vacation!

493
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,833
It's study, study,
and study some more!

494
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,733
Hideki, what is this?

495
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,133
That's a beach parasol.

496
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,833
"The word 'parasol' is Italian."

497
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,800
And this?

498
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,133
An inner tube.

499
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
The buoyancy of an
object in water is equal

500
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,766
to the mass of the water
the object displaces.

501
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,600
This?

502
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,433
A swimsuit.

503
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,200
To wear, wears,
wore, worn, wearing.

504
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,100
Where is this?

505
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,100
The beach.

506
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,066
Wait a second!

507
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,066
Why am I at the beach?!

508
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:24,466
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Goes to the Ocean!"

509
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,433
This is a problem.
I'm having fun!!
