1
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,233
That's Hideki's magazine.

2
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,533
That's also Hideki's magazine.

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,833
Aye! Those are
Hideki's magazines!

4
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,800
Understood!

5
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,966
Oh, there are some
more behind you!

6
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,366
Look, they're all
over the place!

7
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,466
Chi.

8
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,033
Hideki will be home soon.

9
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,133
I see, then!

10
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,266
So he usually comes home
around this time of day!

11
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,100
Understood!

12
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,466
It's Hideki, he's here!

13
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,866
When he comes in,
we say "Welcome home!"

14
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,066
Understood!

15
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,766
Hideki, welcome home!

16
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Chi?

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,333
Hideki has no energy.

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,000
I also could be in big trouble.

19
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:59,466
At this rate, I won't get
into college next year!

20
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,533
Chi?

21
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,766
Huh?

22
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,400
Hideki, what's wrong?
Something happen?

23
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:18,500
Yes, actually.
At prep school today...

24
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,200
No, it's nothing to get all

25
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,900
that worked up about, Chi.

26
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:31,900
That's right, telling Chi
won't really help anything.

27
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh great.

28
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,866
And the summer session's
already started, too!

29
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,500
Chi.

30
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,500
Oh, it's the telephone!
It's the telephone!

31
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:43,366
Who is it?

32
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,266
It's a telephone call
from my master.

33
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,833
Shinbo? Great, put him on.

34
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,833
Aye!

35
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,066
Yo! So how's it goin'?
Everything okay?

36
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,100
Well you seem to
be doing just fine.

37
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,433
Hey, of course I am!

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,133
I'm with the person I love!

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,500
Oh, that's right.

40
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,266
You have no idea what
kind of day I'm having.

41
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,200
What's the matter?

42
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,566
You don't sound
all that chipper.

43
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,033
No, I guess not.

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,200
So what's going on?
Why'd ya call me?

45
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh, right, just a minute.

46
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,733
Hello there, Motosuwa?

47
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Miss Shimizu, is that you?

48
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,300
I wanted to ask you something.

49
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,633
I believe you should be

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,366
getting your grades
about now, right?

51
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,900
Oh, sounds like you've
already gotten them.

52
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,566
So, how were they?

53
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,700
I got straight Es.

54
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,733
I see. That's what I thought.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,733
What you thought?

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,433
But what do you mean by that?

57
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,366
You're not a bad student.

58
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,833
It's just when
it comes to exams,

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,433
your grades tend to
drop off, that's all.

60
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,133
In other words,

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,100
you just don't test very well.

62
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,366
And it's a shame,

63
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:49,666
because you've got
the power to do it

64
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,333
when you really want to.

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,733
Really?

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Motosuwa, why
don't you try taking

67
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,466
the national mock
exam that's coming up?!

68
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,300
Huh?

69
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,700
A national mock exam?

70
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,266
Yeah. It's just a practice run
to get ready for the real one.

71
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,300
A mock exam would probably
be a good opportunity

72
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,766
for you to check up on
your current skill levels.

73
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,200
Miss Shimizu...

74
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:13,233
Well, I'm happy you still
consider me your instructor.

75
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,566
Although it's only fair to say

76
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,066
that I wasn't always
an effective one.

77
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,633
Well, thank you
for all your help,

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,033
and I think I'll take your
advice about the exam.

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,266
That's great. Do your best!

80
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,566
Talk to you soon, man. See ya!

81
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,366
Okay guys, thanks for callin'!

82
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,500
All right! Nothing
is gonna stop me!

83
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,733
I'll show 'em what I can
do when my mind's made up!

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,266
Do your best!

85
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,333
Chi.

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,333
Chi.

87
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,733
Let's see. If the
length of the tangent

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,500
to the circle from
point K, KT, is beta,

89
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,900
then beta must either
be both of them or...

90
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,033
Hideki.

91
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,166
Good morning, everybody!

92
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,800
Another day begins with
the wakey-wakey exercises!

93
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,433
From the front, reach up high!

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,833
One, two, three, four, two,
two, three, four, three-

95
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,300
Hey, Sumomo...

96
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:16,533
I'm sorry, no exercises today.

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Really?

98
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,366
Are you really sure about that?

99
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,500
Oh, what a shame.

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,900
Chi.

101
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,366
Huh?

102
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,333
You're taking time off
starting tomorrow?

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
I have to.

104
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,133
The mock exam's coming up soon,

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,066
so I asked if I could
take about a week off.

106
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,200
Well, it's just seems so sudden.

107
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,833
W-what's this all about?

108
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,833
Is she thinking about me?

109
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,766
Well, you know, I...

110
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,233
Well I'll be rooting
for you, okay?

111
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,000
You just do your best, Senpai.

112
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,233
Huh?

113
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,500
Thank you, Yumi.

114
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,166
Hideki, taking time
off from work?

115
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:43,900
Yeah.

116
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,066
But don't worry,

117
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,333
I'll still be able to come
pick you up after work, Chi.

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,033
Chi.

119
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,866
All right!

120
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,333
From now on,
it's nothing but study!

121
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,933
Nothing can stop me!

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,633
I'm just gonna
go buy some dinner.

123
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,666
Chi.

124
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,133
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,133
That's strange.

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,566
Hideki, something wrong?

127
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,700
My wallet... it's gone.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,033
Chi.

129
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,733
Gone.

130
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
Vanished.

131
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,533
That was all I had,
I cleaned out

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,766
my bank account to make
it through the week!

133
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,166
Chi.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,666
Here you go.

135
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,900
What am I going to live
on 'til my next paycheck?!

136
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,666
It's a whole week away!

137
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,166
Chi.

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,566
The exam's almost here,
what am I gonna do?

139
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,733
I'm so hungry.

140
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,266
I can't study when
I feel like this.

141
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,133
Hideki, still no energy.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,800
My grades go down,

143
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,800
and my wallet goes
along for the ride.

144
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,500
Insult to injury!

145
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,400
Hideki.

146
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,533
It is now time for Chi to
go to work at the bakery!

147
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,933
Chi.

148
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,500
I'll be going now.

149
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,166
Okay. Be careful.

150
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,966
Thank you very much.

151
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,433
Very much!

152
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,600
Thanks for all the
hard work, you two.

153
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,566
Aye!

154
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,833
Chi, do you mind
telling me what's wrong?

155
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,666
Somehow, you don't seem

156
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,733
to be your usual
cheerful self today.

157
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,900
Chi doesn't understand.

158
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,100
But seeing Hideki not cheerful
makes Chi act like this.

159
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,900
Hideki lost his wallet.

160
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:11,000
His grades went down,
so he studies all the time.

161
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:14,833
But Chi can't do
anything for him.

162
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,966
Chi wants to do
something for him.

163
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,266
Chi wants to cheer him up.

164
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,400
Oh, Chi.

165
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:26,666
As long as you feel that way,

166
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,433
Motosuwa will know it,

167
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
and be happy no
matter what you do.

168
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,166
Chi?

169
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,466
Here, this is for the week.

170
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,900
Chi!

171
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,133
Got money for work.

172
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,666
If I give this to Hideki,
he'll be happy.

173
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,066
Aye!

174
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,633
Wha? You want
to give this to me?

175
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,600
Chi. This will make
Hideki cheerful.

176
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,633
Chi.

177
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,900
Chi.

178
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:12,533
I'm very happy,
but I just can't accept this.

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,866
But why not?

180
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,400
It's like I explained last time:

181
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,466
you worked hard for this money

182
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,566
and it belongs to you
and no one else.

183
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,633
It just wouldn't
be fair if I were

184
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
to take this money
from you, Chi.

185
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,666
You have to use this money
for what you want, okay?

186
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,100
Chi.

187
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,900
But, thank you so much;

188
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,233
I really appreciate
what you wanted to do.

189
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,666
And now: study, study, study!

190
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,766
Good morning, Mr. Motosuwa.

191
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:49,100
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't see you.

192
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,000
Good morning.

193
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,200
Oh my, are you all right?

194
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,833
Your eyes seem awfully red.

195
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,666
I'm sure I'm just fine.

196
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,800
Thanks for asking;
I gotta go now.

197
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,900
I sure hope he'll be all right.

198
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,500
Hideki.

199
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,033
Okay everybody, now
here's a particular type

200
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,700
of equation that
you're gonna find

201
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,666
pretty regularly
on entrance exams.

202
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:20,866
It's a little tricky at first,

203
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,900
but I'm sure you'll
get the hang of it.

204
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:25,266
Somehow they seem to think
it's particularly hard,

205
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,366
which it isn't,
or particularly useful...

206
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,966
I wish I didn't always
put up such a big front.

207
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,466
But I guess I'm just like that.

208
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:36,866
Hey, there!
Where are you going now?

209
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,066
Hideki said Chi should
use her work money

210
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,866
for what Chi wants.

211
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,966
So Chi will use it for Hideki!

212
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,366
So what will you do with it?

213
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,400
I will give Hideki a meal.

214
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,866
The other day, Hideki
was eating these things

215
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:52,566
that went round and round.

216
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,166
Hideki will like this.

217
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,166
Wow; you're amazing, Chi!

218
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,366
Chi.

219
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,000
Whoa, warning, warning!

220
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,266
Dangerous gasses!

221
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:13,233
Ventilate immediately,
please ventilate immediately!

222
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,466
Huh?

223
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,633
What's wrong, Chi?
Is something the matter?

224
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,300
Chi.

225
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:33,733
I see, so it was
for Mr. Motosuwa.

226
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,700
Chi wanted to
work to help Hideki,

227
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,466
but Hideki didn't
want the money.

228
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,166
Is there something
Chi can do for Hideki?

229
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,833
What to do to make Hideki happy?

230
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,266
Hideki always looks very happy
when he reads his magazines!

231
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,300
Let's go buy some of these!

232
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:57,566
Magazines!

233
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm sure you're
right about that.

234
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,100
But I know something he'd
like even more than that.

235
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,600
Chi?

236
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,366
I've never been
so hungry before.

237
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,433
It's impossible to study
when I'm like this.

238
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,800
Huh? Oh, that smell
makes my heart race.

239
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:25,900
This is no good.

240
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,066
I shouldn't even look at it.

241
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,800
This isn't gonna help me at all.

242
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,000
But if I don't get any
food into my stomach soon,

243
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,066
I won't be able to study.

244
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:37,733
No!

245
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,266
Mommy, look!

246
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,200
Come on, honey.

247
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:44,833
I'm so hungry!

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,366
Hey, I found the potatoes!

249
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,566
Potatoes go in. Next?

250
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:01,833
Carrots, red onions,
radishes, peppercorns.

251
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,166
That's right, that's the way.

252
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:08,233
Got that? The left hand
is a like a cat's paw.

253
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,433
Don't forget.

254
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Chi remembers.

255
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:14,100
Be careful handling
knives and cleavers.

256
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,233
The left hand is a cat's paw.

257
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,933
I will now prepare the potatoes!

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,933
Sumomo, it might be best

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,766
if you look after the hot water.

260
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,900
Rice not ready yet.

261
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:33,133
Oh no, don't; you don't want

262
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,933
to open the lid until the
rice is completely done, okay?

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,733
Chi, Understand.

264
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,466
I can't do that!

265
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:54,700
Bad idea! What am I thinking?!

266
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:57,566
I can't ask 'em for time off
and then try to get an advance!

267
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,800
To the right! Then to the left!

268
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,766
Chi, Chi.

269
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,300
Oh... That's starting
to smell really good.

270
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:15,300
Mind if I have a taste,
to see how it's coming along?

271
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,900
Mmm, tasty!

272
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,466
Does this mean Hideki
will be happy again?

273
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,866
Will it cheer him up?

274
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,933
Yes, I'm certain he'll be happy.

275
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,866
Chi.

276
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,866
Chi.

277
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,200
I haven't been able to get
any studying done at all.

278
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,100
What's gonna happen

279
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,100
if I have to take
the exam like this?

280
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,633
I've got no money.

281
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,000
I've got no food,
and I can't study.

282
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,633
What's gonna happen to me?

283
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,566
I guess Miss Hibiya
is having curry tonight.

284
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,466
Wait a second, what's
that wonderful smell?

285
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,400
Hideki, welcome home!

286
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,400
Chi, what is that smell?

287
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,033
But this is... How?

288
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,566
Chi and Sumomo
learned everything

289
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,733
from the manager;
she was very helpful.

290
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,633
Huh?

291
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,133
Hideki said Chi's
money should be used

292
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,133
for getting what Chi wants.

293
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,133
And so Chi made
a meal for Hideki.

294
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,433
That's what Chi wanted.

295
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
Chi.

296
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:48,300
Hideki hasn't been
very cheerful lately.

297
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,766
If Hideki isn't cheerful,
Chi isn't cheerful either.

298
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,500
So Chi wants to
give energy to Hideki.

299
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:02,200
Telephone! Telephone!

300
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:04,000
It's from my master!

301
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,233
From Shinbo?

302
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,766
Hey, how's the studying going?

303
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,566
Uh, well...

304
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,700
Huh?

305
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:13,133
Well, I guess I was just
a little worried about you.

306
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,300
Hey come on, it's not like

307
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:17,000
it's the first time I've ever
taken an exam you know.

308
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,233
Okay, maybe not,

309
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,433
but what about the first exam
we took at the prep school?

310
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,166
You forgot to even
put your name on it.

311
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:25,200
Just be careful
during the actual test.

312
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:26,366
You're the kind of guy who tends

313
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,800
to lose track of things
when the pressure's on.

314
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,133
Hmm...

315
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,500
Chi.

316
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,233
You're right; it's true.

317
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,733
I've been missing
all sorts of things

318
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,966
that are right in front of me.

319
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:45,033
See? Just stay calm on exam day.

320
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,333
Yeah.

321
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,300
Sorry about that.

322
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:51,533
Chi.

323
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,233
What are you apologizing for?

324
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,466
Oh, nothing!
Hey, thanks for everything!

325
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,233
Talk to ya later.

326
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,600
Well, yeah...

327
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
Left hand is a cat's paw.

328
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,100
Always skim the top.

329
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,200
Chi learned many things today.

330
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:11,333
Manager was nice;
manager said it was tasty.

331
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,266
Manager said that it
would make Hideki happy.

332
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,266
Oh, I see.

333
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,200
Hideki is smiling.

334
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,766
It's a long time
since Chi saw that.

335
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,800
Happy? Is Hideki happy?

336
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,700
Yeah, I'm happy, Chi.

337
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:33,300
Chi is happy when Chi
sees the smile of Hideki.

338
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,566
Wow, Chi it is tasty!

339
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:41,933
Chi.

340
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,200
Huh?

341
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, good morning, Hideki.

342
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,033
Good morning, Chi.

343
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,333
Chi! What are you
doing dressed like that?!

344
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,600
It's like the one Chi
saw in Hideki's magazine.

345
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,300
Hideki was very
happy looking at it.

346
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,766
Recorded into memory!

347
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,900
Sumomo will dress in the
same manner tomorrow!

348
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:16,600
Stop that!

349
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,366
Chi, please, listen to me:

350
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,800
you can't wear
something like that!

351
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:23,333
Chi. Is this bad?

352
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,033
Well no, it's not bad...

353
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,133
No, it's bad! It's really bad!

354
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Chi.

355
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:33,066
Well. I'll be going now.

356
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,733
Good luck out there!

357
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,100
Do your best! Do your best!

358
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,300
Hideki , do your best.
Do your best!

359
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:42,133
Do your best!
Do your best! Do your best!

360
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,433
Do your best! Do your best!

361
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,333
Chi?

362
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,900
Do you want to come with me?

363
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,133
Chi?

364
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,900
I was thinking maybe we could
go somewhere after the exam.

365
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,900
Oh, and of course,
Sumomo could come with us!

366
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,000
Huh?

367
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:03,833
Chi.

368
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:24,266
Hm?

369
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,333
Doesn't this belong to Senpai?

370
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,100
Hideki!

371
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,933
Let's get goin'.

372
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,100
Chi.

373
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,666
O-souji!

374
00:23:58,733 --> 00:23:59,300
Chi?

375
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:00,266
It makes it more important

376
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,600
when the prefix "o"
gets attached to a word,

377
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,600
even to cleaning!

378
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,300
Chi.

379
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:05,266
O-mori, O-iri, O-gomi, O-atari.

380
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,733
See, when you add the big "o,"

381
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,066
I feel like something
good happens.

382
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:08,733
Chi!

383
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,100
O-medama, O-gui, O-boke, OS,

384
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,933
Ole, O sole mio, Oh my god!

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,866
O-baka-san.

386
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:16,966
Eh?

387
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,566
O-baka-san.

388
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:19,966
Oh no!

389
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,333
Next episode of Chobits:

390
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,333
"Chi Helps."

391
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
By the way,
Miss Hibiya is O-ya-san.

392
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:26,633
O-baka-san.
