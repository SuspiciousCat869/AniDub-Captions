1
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:16,200
It's hot.

2
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,300
I always heard summers were

3
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:20,966
a lot hotter down here,

4
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,900
but I didn't think
it'd be this bad.

5
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,533
It's not supposed to be

6
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,733
this hot right after
the rainy season.

7
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,833
Air conditioning.

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,700
Huh?

9
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:37,266
Hideki... no energy.
Are you sick?

10
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,333
Don't worry.

11
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,900
It's not like I'm sick;
it's just summer fatigue.

12
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,033
Summer fatigue?

13
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,333
Yeah, it's when the
heat totally drains you.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,166
Hideki... no energy.

15
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,233
You could say that.

16
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,566
Well now I'm just wasting time.

17
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,700
At least it's air conditioned
at the prep school.

18
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,166
I can always go
in a little early

19
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,900
and try and get some work done.

20
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:02,766
Hideki.

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,700
Huh?

22
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,666
Do your best!

23
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,166
Yeah!

24
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,933
Why's it have to be like this?

25
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,800
They said that
they'll be all done

26
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,266
with the air conditioning
repairs in no time,

27
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,300
and that they'll have it
running by the next class,

28
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,966
so let's just get
through this hour!

29
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,100
Geez... What a bunch
of lightweights.

30
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,366
Okay, how about this?

31
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,733
I think it's time for a
little class participation.

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll ask you a question,
and then you just answer it;

33
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:47,866
if you get it right,

34
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,266
then I'll treat
everyone to snow cones!

35
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,433
Wow, really?

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,433
You serious?

37
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,400
I want strawberry!

38
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,100
Huh?

39
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,133
Hold your horses,

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,833
I said if you could
answer my question first.

41
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,933
So I'll choose one person

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,133
as a representative
to answer it now.

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,800
So, let's see. Well... Motosuwa!

44
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:03,900
Huh?!

45
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,133
Everyone's counting on you!

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,466
Do your best!

47
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,366
Take a look in your
textbook at page 25,

48
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,000
question number three.

49
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,800
Uh, let's see.

50
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,433
This is...

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Uh.

52
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,166
This is...

53
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,600
Something I don't know.

54
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,533
Aw man, no snow cones.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,433
Oh, you're hopeless.
It's rudimentary.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,533
All right then, anyway
I think the best way

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,333
to explain this
one would probably be

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,666
for me to use an
example like this.

59
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,733
Huh?

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,700
Now in this case,

61
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:42,333
you'll often find that
they use this form--

62
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,433
You're late.

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh man, it's hot in here.

64
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,700
Yeah.

65
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:55,466
The air conditioning's broken.

66
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh!

67
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,133
So I guess you're the
one who broke it then?

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,166
Why me?!

69
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,000
'Cuz you look depressed,
that's all.

70
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, there's been
a lot going on.

71
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,333
Huh.

72
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:08,600
Hey, by the way,

73
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,833
do you have any
spare time today?

74
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,333
Yeah, a little before work.

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,766
Well, I'd like to
look at your notes

76
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,800
from English class
if that's alright with you.

77
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,333
I'll treat you to
lunch if you want.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,566
Okay, that's cool.

79
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,733
I can't believe how
terrible your handwriting is.

80
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,666
Y-You think so?

81
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,000
What's this letter
here that looks like

82
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,700
an upside-down musical note?

83
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:35,766
Huh?

84
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,200
Oh, that's a "U."

85
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,666
You call that a "U"?

86
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,266
Come on, my handwriting
might not be great,

87
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
but I'm sure the
notes are still good.

88
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,700
Hm-hm...

89
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,433
Hey, Sumomo.

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,666
Aye!

91
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,733
I'd like you to translate
the English textbook for me,

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,466
starting with the sixth line
on page one-fifty-eight.

93
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,600
Roger, I understand!

94
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,333
Whether weakness should be

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,433
placed among the
causes of happiness

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,366
or among the
causes of unhappiness,

97
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,533
may perhaps be regarded
as a doubtful question.

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,166
It's just as I thought.

99
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,066
That's good, Sumomo.

100
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:12,833
Aye!

101
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,066
Hey, you got this all wrong.

102
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,933
What? Are you sure?

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,466
Sumomo is a
smart little Persocom.

104
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,733
Huh?

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,833
Oh, no, not really.

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,966
Sumomo's had English translation
software installed in her.

107
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,266
Huh, I didn't know
you could do that.

108
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,100
She can even give
sample problems;

109
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,266
it's very handy.

110
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,733
Wow.

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,366
Would you like to borrow her?

112
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,366
Huh?

113
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,566
I'd like to return
the favor for the notes,

114
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,033
so you could take her for a day.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
No, I don't think so.

116
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:43,966
Huh?

117
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,433
You know how it is.

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,866
It's just that I'd rather
do it on my own, that's all.

119
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:50,300
Working with a computer
is just so different.

120
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,733
But thanks a lot anyway.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,566
Oh, I see.

122
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,166
Time for me to go to work.

123
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:01,800
You can hold onto the notes,
just give 'em back to me later.

124
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,866
Well, thanks for the meal.

125
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,100
Hey, Motosuwa.

126
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,300
Hm?

127
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:09,266
In Miss Shimizu's class today,
did she say anything about

128
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,900
what she was going
to do tomorrow?

129
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,000
Huh? No, not really.

130
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,133
Oh, okay...

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,533
Well, see you later!

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,766
See ya.

133
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,433
I'm home.

134
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,433
Hideki, welcome home.

135
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,800
Oh, it's so hot.

136
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,366
Huh?

137
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,466
Oh, where'd you get that?

138
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,766
The manager brought it over.

139
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,366
She said to put it here.

140
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,933
I see.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,166
That takes me back;

142
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,733
getting a whiff of that makes
me feel like summer's here.

143
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,833
Summer?

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,333
This is summer?

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,666
No, no.

146
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm talking about the seasons.

147
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:58,233
The hot season is summer,
the cold season is winter,

148
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,333
and the warm season is-

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,500
Huh?

150
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,733
Who could that be
at this time of night?

151
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,633
Yes, who is it?

152
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,133
Well, good evening! It's me.

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,766
It's me!

154
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,166
What nerve, how could
you forget me?!

155
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm sorry!

156
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:17,866
I apologize;
I didn't mean anything.

157
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,433
It's not like I forgot
you or, I was distracted.

158
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
The summer, well a memory
of summer, that's...

159
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:21,966
I'm not taking you for granted,

160
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,100
it's just, that
I'm serious, I was just-

161
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,033
Did I surprise you?

162
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,266
Huh?

163
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,900
M-Miss Shimizu!

164
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,233
What is it? I don't get it.

165
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,600
What are you doing
here so late at night?

166
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,500
Can I stay over?

167
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,233
Huh?

168
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,433
Stay over? Stay over?

169
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,900
Huh?

170
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,733
So, this is what
Motosuwa's place is like.

171
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,866
Uh, she's fast!

172
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,133
It certainly feels like
a guy's room, all right.

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,866
Why are you doing
inside already?!

174
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:45,733
Hmm?

175
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh, I see, so you
really ARE a guy.

176
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,400
Hm?

177
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,200
Hey, you don't have to
do that; I don't mind.

178
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,700
Yeah, great; well I do mind!

179
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:55,733
Hm...

180
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,066
Huh?

181
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:57,866
Chi!

182
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,666
Let's see, wasn't
your name "Chi"?

183
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,766
Chi?

184
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,233
Good evening.

185
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,266
Oh, that's great:
you got it right this time!

186
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,233
Good girl!

187
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,033
Now we're gonna get
down and drink tonight!

188
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Hey, wait a minute,

189
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,200
how'd we get to
that all of a sudden?

190
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,900
Why, you've been
drinking already!

191
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,566
So, are you done cleaning up?

192
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,533
Yes, finally.

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,833
Hey, don't change the subject!

194
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,800
What are you up to?

195
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,966
What do you mean "stay over"?!

196
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,033
You mean I can't?

197
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,300
Well, it's not that you can't...

198
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:22,100
It's, well, it's more like

199
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,866
it's just not the
best idea in the world.

200
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:26,233
I guess there's no choice then.

201
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,233
If that's the way
you're gonna be.

202
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,400
I guess I'll just have

203
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:31,033
to spend the night
somewhere else.

204
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,266
What are you thinking?

205
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,266
That's even worse!

206
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,833
So, then you'll
let me stay here?

207
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,300
If anything happens,
it won't be my fault.

208
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,866
Motosuwa,

209
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,266
are you going to do
something with me?

210
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,433
No, I mean...

211
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:53,600
You really are a
nice guy. Aren't you?

212
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,566
Are you really going
to drink all this, ma'am?

213
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,466
Of course I am. Why do you ask?

214
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, so tell me this one:

215
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,766
Chi, what's that up there?

216
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,966
The moon! Hideki taught me that!

217
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:10,033
Good! And what do
you call that shape?

218
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,433
Chi.

219
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a smiling moon!

220
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh, she's so cute!

221
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,833
So anyway, what
I really wanted to do

222
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,600
was teach elementary school.

223
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,866
Elementary school?

224
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:27,200
So you really wanted to be
an elementary school teacher?

225
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,800
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

226
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:33,033
But then my husband...

227
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,566
He kept saying
that the work I had

228
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,733
to put in to teach all those
little kids would make it

229
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,266
so I wouldn't have
time for anything else.

230
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,900
Huh, your husband.

231
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:42,966
Huh?

232
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,333
Did what you just say
mean that you're married?!

233
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,733
Yeah, for the time being.

234
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,066
Uh, for the time being?

235
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:56,033
Hey, Motosuwa?

236
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,166
Yeah?

237
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:01,133
Do you find
Persocoms attractive?

238
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,466
Is it more fun to be

239
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,933
with a Persocom
than with a human?

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
But Ma'am, I...

241
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,966
Motosuwa, that look on
your face is so funny!

242
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,933
What's so funny about it?

243
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:29,000
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

244
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:31,366
t-ten!

245
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:34,066
Wow, amazing!

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Is Hideki all right?

247
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:39,533
Yeah, I'm okay.
Could you get off me?

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,366
Chi.

249
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,366
Uh, ma'am?

250
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,166
What do you say we just
stop and call it a draw?

251
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,100
Why?

252
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,466
Follow The King's a great game!

253
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,133
What's the matter,
aren't you having any fun?

254
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,433
I'm the one who keeps
getting ordered around,

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,900
so it's not much fun.

256
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,333
It's not my fault;
it's the luck of the draw.

257
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:54,733
Chi?

258
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Now, onto the next round!

259
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,233
Come on, don't be chicken.

260
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,800
Here ya go: draw!

261
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:01,933
And you can play, too, Chi.

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,133
Chi.

263
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,733
And...

264
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,833
Who shall be the King?!

265
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,233
Me!

266
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,933
Chi?

267
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,566
Okay, let's see.

268
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,266
Whatta ya say we
try to, I don't know,

269
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,766
get a little excitement going?

270
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,033
Excitement?

271
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,766
Number 2: it's time to...

272
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,466
Kiss the king.

273
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,866
K-Kiss?!

274
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,500
Now, number 2, raise your hand!

275
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,766
W-What number was I?

276
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,433
What a relief that is;

277
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,966
yet somehow it's a letdown.

278
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,466
Wait, that means she's gonna...

279
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,933
All right, Chi, time to smooch!

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,266
Smooch!

281
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:41,900
No! Don't do it!

282
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:42,533
You again.

283
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,366
Oh, hold your tongue;

284
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,900
the king's the absolute monarch,

285
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,533
and subjects need to submit.

286
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,733
Ma'am, it's just...

287
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
you're glaring at me.

288
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,266
It's time for the king,
ready or not, Chi.

289
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,500
Close your eyes.

290
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:55,766
Chi.

291
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:59,400
Oh, she's just the cutest thing.

292
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,400
I'll just leave it at that;

293
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,300
after all, she is
Motosuwa's Persocom.

294
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,233
Try to keep the
surprises to a minimum.

295
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,900
Chi?

296
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:29,933
Huh?

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,466
Hideki, lots of
energy down here.

298
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,600
Huh?

299
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
Yes, well, uh, it's just...

300
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:41,800
Hmm...

301
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,766
It's not like I was thinking

302
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,933
about anything perverted,
it's just, well,

303
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,133
you know, it's just that...

304
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,966
Hideki.

305
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,766
It's not that I...

306
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,500
Hideki.

307
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:48,466
Huh?

308
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,700
Miss Shimizu...
she just fell down.

309
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:53,300
Huh?

310
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,800
Miss Shimizu?

311
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:00,833
I hope there's nothing wrong.

312
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
Huh?

313
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:25,166
Oh, that's right, I fell asleep.

314
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,500
Motosuwa.

315
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:43,900
Huh?

316
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,300
Miss Shimizu?

317
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,500
Shh...

318
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,700
You'll wake Chi up.

319
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,066
Huh?

320
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,933
Motosuwa...

321
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:09,200
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

322
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,466
It was a dream.

323
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,400
But it was so realistic.

324
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,900
Mm...

325
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,966
Huh?

326
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,466
Morning already?

327
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,700
Chi.

328
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:32,333
M-Miss Shimizu...
in her lingerie...

329
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,466
just like in my dream.

330
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,433
That's impossible.

331
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,400
Oh, good morning, Chi.

332
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:41,066
Chi.

333
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,366
Huh?

334
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,000
Hideki, face is all wet.

335
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,166
Huh?

336
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,433
Well, that attire of yours...

337
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,333
Attire?

338
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,233
Oh, don't worry about it,

339
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,766
I didn't take advantage you.

340
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,933
Take advantage of me?

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,533
It's better if it's

342
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,166
with the one you
love the first time.

343
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,866
Don't worry, Motosuwa,
you're still pure.

344
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,000
It was just a little hot,

345
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,266
so I took off my clothes.

346
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,600
Same as you, Motosuwa.

347
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,733
Me?!

348
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,966
It's too late for that.
I saw it all.

349
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,100
All?

350
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,766
It was average size.

351
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,100
No!

352
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,766
Average size. Hideki is average.

353
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,733
Chi! You don't
have to learn that!

354
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,933
Chi.

355
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,566
Is it okay if I use your sink?

356
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,133
S-Sure.

357
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,133
But don't you need a
toothbrush or anything?

358
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,133
Got one of those right here.

359
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,633
I sort of knew I was going to be

360
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,933
spending the night out.

361
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,866
Huh?

362
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,033
You mean you knew
that you'd stay here?

363
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,233
Of course not.

364
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,033
Then, why are you here?

365
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,000
Because I'm just
a coward, I guess.

366
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,733
Well, Chi, see you later.

367
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
Time for me to go too. Bye, Chi.

368
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,766
Take care of yourselves.

369
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
I'll be going now.

370
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,466
Oh, that's right...

371
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,966
I wonder if Shinbo left already.

372
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,166
Motosuwa, we'll be late.

373
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,066
Okay!

374
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,366
Sorry to keep you waiting!

375
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,566
Good morning, Mr. Motosuwa.

376
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,833
Good morning.

377
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,366
Oh, hello.

378
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,100
I believe we met at
the beach last week.

379
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,800
Huh? Uh, well, this is, uh...

380
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,100
Yes, I remember;
I'm Takako Shimizu.

381
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:37,133
Oh, so you teach
at the prep school.

382
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,066
Well, that's great:

383
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,000
you must have been able

384
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,600
to get a lot of
studying done last night.

385
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,666
Well, actually, you know...

386
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,566
Yes.

387
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,766
Huh?

388
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,300
T-That's right.

389
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,300
Well, I'm very
glad to hear that.

390
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:52,766
Hey, come on,

391
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,700
what's with all the heavy sighs?

392
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,766
I wonder if she misunderstood.

393
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,733
Are you still
worried about that?

394
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,866
Well, don't be.

395
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,066
If you're that concerned,
I'll just go talk to her.

396
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,100
I wouldn't want to mess
up your private life.

397
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,666
I'm sure you don't want
anyone to think we're dating.

398
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,933
What are you talking about?

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,066
Aren't you the one
who should be worried?

400
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,533
I mean you're the one
who's married, right?

401
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,600
I see.

402
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,166
Well, that's true.

403
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:18,633
Miss Shimizu?

404
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,466
I don't know what it is that's
bothering you so much,

405
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,300
but it certainly seems
to be something.

406
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,533
I just want to say that

407
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,733
if you ever need someone
to talk about anything,

408
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,700
I'll always be happy to listen.

409
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,233
Motosuwa.

410
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,533
It's just like they say,

411
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,366
you really are a nice guy,
even if you are a virgin.

412
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,200
Wha--?!

413
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,500
Why'd ya say that?!

414
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,533
What's that gotta
do with anything?

415
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,066
Oh, man, I'm tired.

416
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,233
Shinbo.

417
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,600
Shinbo, Shinbo!

418
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,866
Mm?

419
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,000
What's the matter?

420
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,233
Did you come to
class early today?

421
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Huh?! Shinbo!

422
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,700
Huh?

423
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:07,500
You're a wreck.
Were you up all night?

424
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:08,833
Uh...

425
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,866
Oh, well, sorta...

426
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,366
Hmm...

427
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,166
You don't look so hot yourself.

428
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:23,100
Well, to tell you the truth,
last night, outta nowhere,

429
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,966
Miss Shimizu came to my room.

430
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,300
W-What?!

431
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,433
Geez, what the
heck's wrong with you?!

432
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,533
You don't have to yell. Huh?

433
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,333
Good morning, everyone!

434
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,133
Good morning!

435
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
Alright, please take your seats.

436
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,266
Time for class.

437
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,666
Oh, my notes.
Hey Shinbo, you got my...?

438
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:47,066
Oh?

439
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,433
What's with him?

440
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Alright, everybody,
let's get started.

441
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:55,266
Okay, let's take out our
textbooks and open to page 26.

442
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,200
Miss Shimizu?

443
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,533
I'm exhausted.

444
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,400
Today was not the greatest day.

445
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:11,033
First, Shinbo
gets all weird in class

446
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,200
and won't talk to me,

447
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,966
and then I can't stop
thinking about it all night,

448
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,033
so I made all those
mistakes at work.

449
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,200
Huh?

450
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,633
And now, rain.

451
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,133
I'm going straight to bed.

452
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:44,033
Don't cry.

453
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,733
I'm not crying.

454
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,400
Really? Then why
is my chest so wet?

455
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,300
It's the rain;
what else will it be?

456
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:57,833
Can't you even be a
little bit honest, Takako?

457
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm not honest!
I'm not attractive, either!

458
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,166
Yes, you are.

459
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,933
You're very attractive.

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,700
Tremendously attractive.

461
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,466
Look what I did;

462
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,566
I got makeup all over you.

463
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,300
That doesn't matter.

464
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,833
Just be quiet for a bit.

465
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,000
But why?

466
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:35,000
When women cry,
they just look so vulnerable.

467
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,566
All women?

468
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,600
You're the best, Takako.

469
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:45,766
I'm afraid someone
might be watching.

470
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,533
I don't care.

471
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:51,333
I told you, I've already
made my decision.

472
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,000
A person who teaches

473
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,666
at a prep school
is the instructor.

474
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,666
The people who study there
are the prep school students.

475
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,800
The prep school instructor
is Miss Shimizu,

476
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:07,900
and Miss Shimizu was locked in

477
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,800
an embrace with a
prep school student.

478
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,533
And that prep school
student is Shinbo.

479
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,766
Miss Shimizu is a married woman.

480
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,633
Shinbo is my friend,
and I, well I just...

481
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,833
Chi, what do you
think I should do?

482
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,933
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Doesn't Do Anything."

483
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,433
That's what I thought.
