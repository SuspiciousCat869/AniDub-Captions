1
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you love me?

2
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,800
Or...

3
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,700
Do you love me?

4
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,000
Or...

5
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,533
That was the worst night's sleep

6
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,633
I think I've ever had.

7
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,866
Just imagining Shinbo
having a relationship

8
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,333
with Miss Shimizu
is driving me nuts.

9
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,466
Ah! I can't stand it!

10
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:30,166
I'm so jealous of you, Shinbo!

11
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,366
Chi.

12
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,700
But, wait a minute.

13
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:35,866
I thought that Miss Shimizu
was married, isn't she?

14
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,033
But there's no way
Shinbo could be her husband.

15
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,200
So that means...

16
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,333
He's with someone else's wife?

17
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,333
What's a wife?

18
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,900
What do you mean?

19
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,266
The Sensual Wives at Night.

20
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,200
No, Chi!

21
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,300
You shouldn't read
stuff like that, okay?!

22
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,066
And to answer your question,

23
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,600
a wife is what you call a woman

24
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,300
when she's married to a man.

25
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:10,000
When she's married?

26
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:11,500
Huh? Um, well...

27
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,966
It's uh...

28
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,200
Huh?

29
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,000
It's morning!

30
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:20,200
Time for the
wakey-wakey exercises!

31
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,600
Okay, raise your arms
high up in the air!

32
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,466
What do you think you're doing?!

33
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,700
Scary!

34
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,166
Okay, I'll try it another way:

35
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:40,600
why are you here, Sumomo?

36
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,766
Here you go.

37
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,400
Please look after
her for a while.

38
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,266
Oh great, and for how long?!

39
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,600
He is scary, he is!

40
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,633
What's going on?

41
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,433
I can't deal with this,
this is totally insane!

42
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,100
5 minutes until departure!

43
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,733
There's never any time;
I just can't handle it!

44
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,700
I'm sorry, Chi!
I'll see you Later!

45
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,766
Chi!

46
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,233
I'm very sorry I'm late;

47
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,433
it won't happen again.

48
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Hey, what's up?

49
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,433
Miss Shimizu
hasn't come in today.

50
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,900
She gets here early
now and then,

51
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:28,066
but she's never late like this.

52
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,533
Yeah, I hope nothing's wrong.

53
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,933
Miss Shimizu never
did show up in class,

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,433
and neither did Shinbo.

55
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,866
I can't seem to get
this out of my mind.

56
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,033
What are they up to?

57
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,333
Chi?

58
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,766
Oh, I wouldn't get too worried;

59
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,266
it'll all sort out somehow.

60
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,766
Chi.

61
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:02,933
But, that's what I don't get...

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,133
Why would Shinbo
just leave Sumomo

63
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,500
with me like that?

64
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,100
Senpai!

65
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:10,966
Huh?

66
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,800
Senpai, what are
you doing? Watch out!

67
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:13,366
Huh?

68
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,166
Gah!

69
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh my god!

70
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,866
What's the matter with me?!

71
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,233
Is something
bothering you, Senpai?

72
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,766
Well, yeah, I guess
you could sorta...

73
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,133
Huh?

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,466
Would you like to make a change?

75
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,766
Because the proceeding event

76
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,066
is running longer than usual,
the show selected

77
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,166
for recording is now
delayed a half hour!

78
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,533
Hey, keep it down, will ya?

79
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,733
Sumomo!

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,433
I'm working here;
try to stay quiet?

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,166
Do you want me to adjust
the recording time accordingly?

82
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,666
Yeah, okay, sure, whatever.

83
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:50,766
Just get back into the bag!

84
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,933
Aye!

85
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,533
Shinbo!

86
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,766
Senpai... that Persocom...

87
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,800
Well, you see, I guess Shinbo
just went and put her in my bag

88
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:02,766
when I wasn't looking,

89
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,200
and now I'm supposed
to look after her

90
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,133
for some reason.

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,433
What do you think would have

92
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,133
made him leave her
here with me anyway?

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
She doesn't take up
much room at all,

94
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,033
and she usually keeps out
of the way most of the time.

95
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,700
Yes, that's very true.

96
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,166
You know a Persocom can
do pretty much anything,

97
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,166
and they can also
do about any job

98
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,400
you could ever want it to do.

99
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,633
I'm sorry, Yumi.

100
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,733
I shouldn't be bothering you
with something like this.

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,700
Oh no, don't worry about it!

102
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:30,866
I'm very happy to be able

103
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,766
to help my senpai
with his problems,

104
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,366
whenever he's in the
mood to share them

105
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,433
with me, that is.

106
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,733
Thank you, that's very nice.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,566
Today was a real disaster.

108
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:44,733
What a mess;

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,966
and it's all because
of Shinbo this time.

110
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,666
Telephone!

111
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,666
Answer, please! Answer, please!

112
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,966
Only five more rings,
and if you don't answer,

113
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,566
I will switch over
to voicemail mode.

114
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,966
All right, go ahead.

115
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:01,400
Aye! Making connection now.

116
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:02,966
Hey, what's up?

117
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,300
Wha-?!

118
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,666
Wait a minute!
That sounds like Shinbo's voice!

119
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,966
Where are you?!
And what are you doing?!

120
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm eloping with our teacher.

121
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,700
Where do I plug this thing in?

122
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,100
Chi?

123
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,833
I think it was this one.

124
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,200
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

125
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,666
What's wrong with this thing?!

126
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,700
Come on, let's go now,
show me something!

127
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:30,300
Chi.

128
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:33,500
Is this it? This one?

129
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,133
Okay, so this one,
then? This one?

130
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,100
Come on now!

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
I got it!

132
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,166
Hey, Motosuwa!

133
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,500
Shinbo!

134
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,033
So you managed
to get it hooked up

135
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,433
all by yourself, huh?

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,566
I guess I'm a better teacher
than I thought I was.

137
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,666
Enough with the small talk!

138
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:51,466
What's the deal

139
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,766
with this
"eloping" stuff, Buddy?

140
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,866
What are you doing?!

141
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,900
Just what I said.

142
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,466
I'm currently on the
run with Miss Shimizu.

143
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,333
Well, that's great!

144
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,366
But I wanna know
why you're running off

145
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,300
with a prep school
teacher all of a sudden!

146
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,366
I mean...

147
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,633
How long has this been
going on between you two?

148
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,366
Oh well, it's pretty close
to six months, I'd say.

149
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,366
Are you saying that this started

150
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,366
as soon as we
entered prep school?

151
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,733
Mm-hm!

152
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,433
You and our teacher,
without me ever knowing?!

153
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,600
Chi.

154
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,300
You didn't even tell me!

155
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, I didn't think...

156
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,500
Huh?

157
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh come on, not now!

158
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,133
Come on!

159
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,966
I guess there's
nothing I can do.

160
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,200
The TV's pretty old,

161
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,000
and it's a cheap
model to begin with,

162
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,600
and I'm sure I don't even
know how to wire up right.

163
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,500
This isn't the time to be
thinking things like that.

164
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:38,766
What do I do now?!

165
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,566
Hideki...

166
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,633
Chi, I'm gonna go
over to Minoru's house

167
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,133
and see if he
can be of any help.

168
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
I'll be right back soon.

169
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,700
You should just
stay right here, okay?

170
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,233
What does eloping mean?

171
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,566
Eh?

172
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,366
Is this good? Or is it bad?

173
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,066
Well Chi, I wish I knew.

174
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,033
That's a tough one. I'm sorry,

175
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,866
but I just don't know
how to answer that.

176
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,200
Hideki.

177
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,966
But I think I'll find out.

178
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,233
Chi.

179
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,533
Chi.

180
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,866
What's the matter with him,

181
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,600
is he out of his
mind or something?

182
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,300
Eloping with his teacher?

183
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,600
Shinbo, you idiot!

184
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,033
Mr. Motosuwa is here to see you.

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,800
What brings him here so late?

186
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,033
I'll go down

187
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,733
and make some fresh
tea for Mr. Motosuwa.

188
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,566
That's quite the
dramatic entrance.

189
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,533
I need you to connect this thing

190
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,066
to a phone line that
can show images!

191
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,366
Can you do that right now?

192
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:54,366
I presume what you're talking
about is live video feed.

193
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,633
Yeah, I guess it's
something like that.

194
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,600
How do I know?!

195
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,666
That's fine, but who
is it you need to call?

196
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,133
An eloper, that's who!

197
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,466
Huh?

198
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,733
Grrrr.

199
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,866
All right, it's connected now.

200
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,233
So it shows up here?

201
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,066
Yes, after a moment.

202
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,433
So, have you finally you
got it working, Motosuwa?

203
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,366
Shinbo.

204
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,133
Oh, so you're at
Kokubunji's house.

205
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,066
Hello.

206
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,466
All right, that's
enough of that, Shinbo.

207
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,533
Why didn't you
tell me anything?!

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,566
I didn't mind
telling you about it.

209
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:33,766
Huh?

210
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,600
I guess the truth is
I actually wanted

211
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,266
to tell you 'cause...

212
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,333
I really did think of
you as a close friend.

213
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,466
You know what I mean?
I hope you do.

214
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,666
Shinbo...

215
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,133
And I considered you
a close friend too;

216
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,766
that's why I wish
I'd known, that's all.

217
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,200
It's just that
Takako wouldn't say yes.

218
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,066
Takako?

219
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,966
That's Miss Shimizu's
first name.

220
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:54,066
I don't suppose you know
that Takako was married.

221
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,566
Yeah, I know about that.

222
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,900
She told me about
her husband the night

223
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,033
when she stayed over.

224
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,200
Her husband got hooked

225
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,300
on Persocoms right
after they got married,

226
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,866
and when she noticed,
it seemed like

227
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,833
that was the only thing
they ever talked about.

228
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,633
It didn't happen all at once,
and at the very beginning,

229
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,733
she thought it might even
help bring them together,

230
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,000
so she was happy about
buying a Persocom.

231
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,566
But after a while,

232
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,300
her husband only seemed
interested in the Persocom.

233
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,433
Eventually, it got so bad,

234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,966
he wouldn't even
bother to talk to her

235
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,300
when she was right there.

236
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,366
With a Persocom?!

237
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,166
You're kidding.

238
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,466
You're still pretty new to this,

239
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,266
that's why it doesn't
mean much to you.

240
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,666
But it's happening
more and more.

241
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:28,866
Come to think of it...

242
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,700
Do you find
Persocoms attractive?

243
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:34,333
Is it more fun to be with
a Persocom than a human?

244
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,833
Oh. So that's what
she meant by all that.

245
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,100
You know that little park
near the prep school?

246
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,100
You know the one
with all the trees?

247
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,033
Well, it was right after
the school year started...

248
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,400
It was early evening,

249
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:55,133
and I was just on my way home
through the park, and Takako...

250
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,566
Of course back at that time,

251
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,500
I wouldn't have even thought

252
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,166
of calling her
by her first name.

253
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,500
But anyway, there she was,
sitting by herself on a swing.

254
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,000
Huh?

255
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,833
She seemed to be
enjoying a private moment,

256
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,700
or getting in tune
with her inner child

257
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:12,833
or something, so
I just left her alone.

258
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,200
But then, after
I ate some dinner,

259
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:20,000
and it was getting
pretty late by that point,

260
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:24,366
I saw her again,
still sitting there.

261
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,866
And that just didn't seem right.

262
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,433
Miss Shimizu?

263
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,133
Oh, Shinbo.

264
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,233
Are you okay?

265
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,866
What are you doing out here?

266
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,166
I can't get in my apartment.

267
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,333
The door's locked,
so I'm sort of stuck here.

268
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,466
So what happened?

269
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,666
Did you lock your keys
inside your house or something?

270
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,466
No, it's not about the keys.

271
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,666
The chain is on,
so I can't get in.

272
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,400
The chain's on?

273
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,666
Then that means there's
someone inside, doesn't it?

274
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,533
Miss Shimizu?

275
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,866
That would be my husband.

276
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,166
Husband?

277
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:25,633
So, did you have
a fight with him?

278
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,666
A fight?

279
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,000
No, I haven't had a fight
with him in quite a while.

280
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,166
Huh?

281
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,766
Or rather...

282
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,233
we haven't spoken
in quite a while.

283
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,100
Hearing about all that
knocked me for a loop,

284
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,433
so I told her she
ought to be mad at him.

285
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
But she just shook her head.

286
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,333
Why?

287
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,600
The fact that he put the chain

288
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,566
on the door means that
my husband has now

289
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:55,600
completely forgotten that
I would be coming home at all.

290
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,666
I suppose what
it really boils down

291
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,033
to is it doesn't matter
if I'm here or not.

292
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,666
When I thought about it,

293
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,500
nothing seemed
to matter anymore.

294
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,033
Nothing seems to matter.

295
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:51,233
She said all this,
and yet she wasn't crying,

296
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,033
not a single tear had fallen.

297
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,300
Even though I knew
that deep down

298
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:01,533
in her heart,
she really wanted to cry.

299
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,900
But she was trying

300
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:05,900
with all her
might to hold it in.

301
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,666
So, now I'll know,

302
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,833
when bad or cruel
things happen...

303
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,633
that she's able
to cry if she has to.

304
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,666
That was when I fell in love.

305
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,533
And that's when
I started to push the issue.

306
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,200
At first, Takako
kept reminding me

307
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,700
that she was my teacher,
and I was her student,

308
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:27,700
and of course that
she was married,

309
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,500
and you know, all
those sorts of things.

310
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:35,333
But I pushed, and I pushed,
and I kept right on pushing.

311
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,933
And that's how we got
to where we are today.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,833
But why'd ya hafta elope,
can you tell me that?!

313
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,333
Is that the only
way you could do it,

314
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,566
is that's what's goin' on?!

315
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,933
First of all, we're still kids!

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Didja ever think about that?!

317
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,100
What are you gonna do now?!

318
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,366
It's not gonna be easy!!

319
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,966
Well, I guess ya got a point.

320
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,333
And I know it won't all be
easy; there'll be trouble.

321
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
So?

322
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,200
But then again:

323
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,333
this is what I decided,
and it is what it is!

324
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,766
Really? Decided?

325
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,866
Takako has pretty much
lost her trust in men.

326
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:07,366
So that even if they say
"I love you" at first,

327
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,500
if something that
works to their advantage

328
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:12,866
or suits their fancy,
like a Persocom, comes along,

329
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,833
they'll just turn
right around as if

330
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
nothing ever happened.

331
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,500
And even though I told her

332
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,633
countless times that
I wouldn't be like that,

333
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,033
she didn't believe me.

334
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
The other day,

335
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,533
when Takako went
over to your place,

336
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,933
That was the big day.

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
The two of us were
gonna get together and...

338
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,400
discuss our future.

339
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:35,733
But when it really
came down to it,

340
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,033
she chickened out
at the last minute.

341
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,466
Well, I guess a woman's
heart is sorta complicated.

342
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,266
That's why...

343
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,433
Why what?

344
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,666
I decided to take her away

345
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,166
to this old hot springs
resort in the mountains

346
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,033
where it's just the two of us.

347
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,366
It's a great place!

348
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:54,900
Lots of atmosphere.

349
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,466
You're just talking about
a lovey-dovey vacation!

350
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:58,533
I guess.

351
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,166
But it's still eloping to me.

352
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,900
Anyway, I don't plan
on coming back

353
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:05,033
until I can finally manage
to get Takako to say yes.

354
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,966
Say yes? To what?

355
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,466
To marrying me.

356
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,966
To marrying you?!

357
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:12,666
Married. Marriage.
So you're getting married?

358
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:13,600
That's all, right?

359
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,933
Yeah, so I'd
appreciate it if you can

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,333
hold onto Sumomo
a little while longer.

361
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,633
Yeah, I'm sure I could to that.

362
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,700
Who are you talking to?

363
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,366
To Motosuwa.

364
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,900
Oh. Ohhhhh!

365
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:32,633
Wow, Miss Shimizu is
much sexier than usual!

366
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:34,600
Okay, see ya, Motosuwa!

367
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,500
I'll give you a call
later when I have a chance.

368
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,400
Hey, wait a minute!

369
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:38,500
Huh?

370
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:40,566
Next time, if there's
something going on,

371
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,400
I want you to tell me.

372
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,733
Motosuwa...

373
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,533
I mean, it's not like I could
necessarily do anything;

374
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,366
I couldn't even
get into college.

375
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,400
But I'm not a moron,

376
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,100
and I could have
helped you somehow.

377
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,733
So you... you just...

378
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,366
you have to tell me next time.

379
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,500
Got that?
That's all there is to it!

380
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,700
Sure.

381
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,966
Shinbo.

382
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,766
He's such a big pain.

383
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,066
You know, Motosuwa
really is a nice guy.

384
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,933
Yep, he's one of the best.

385
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,233
But that's also a problem:

386
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,366
he's such a nice guy

387
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,333
that he has a hard
time getting a girlfriend.

388
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,700
And that's why he's a virgin.

389
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:26,866
That night...

390
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,200
You know, when I stayed
over at Motosuwa's?

391
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,466
Oh, yeah, that would
have been right about

392
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,733
when I was out looking
for you all over town.

393
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,633
I'm so sorry.

394
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,733
But that night...

395
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,666
Huh?

396
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,800
After I had made
such a big fuss,

397
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:41,400
I was really exhausted...

398
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,266
I woke up and found
Motosuwa leaning

399
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,033
against the wall,
and at that point,

400
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,000
it was hard for me to tell

401
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:48,433
whether he was
even awake or not.

402
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,366
So that's when,
I just had to ask him.

403
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,766
Do you think it's wrong
for a married person

404
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,800
to fall in love
with someone else?

405
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,500
Not if you can't help it.

406
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:09,733
Huh?

407
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,000
It's impossible to
control your emotions

408
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,900
when you truly fall in love.

409
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,733
But that kind of situation

410
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,933
is very hard on
everyone involved.

411
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,766
And the whole thing is
very painful for everybody.

412
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,000
So since everybody's suffering,

413
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,533
it's better to follow your heart
and do what's right for you,

414
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,233
than to live in confusion.

415
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,100
That's exactly what he said.

416
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,366
That's awfully wise for Hideki.

417
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,633
Considering he's a virgin.

418
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,800
But there was something
that really affected my heart.

419
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,100
He said everything's all right,

420
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
and I should do
what's right for me.

421
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,300
His words made me
feel indescribably calm.

422
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:52,200
And, so you can
do the right thing,

423
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:55,233
you're going to be with me, now.

424
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,266
But I haven't said enough yet.

425
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,100
"Yet" just means
that we're moving

426
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,033
in the right direction,
that's all.

427
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,300
Shinbo, you really
are a positive person.

428
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:06,466
Hold on, now.

429
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,733
So after all we've been through,
I'm still Shinbo to you?

430
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,600
Now, here's a question.

431
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,200
What would I like
you to call me?

432
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,700
Get it right,
and get a gold star!

433
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,900
"Hiromu."

434
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,433
Correct.

435
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,166
Mr. Motosuwa, it's true:
you really are a nice guy.

436
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,300
Oh, I'm not like that at all.

437
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,600
I'm so embarrassed by all this.

438
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,066
But nice guy or not,

439
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,733
you still don't
have a girlfriend.

440
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,766
Ah!

441
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,066
Oh, stop that, willya?!
Leave me alone!

442
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:55,900
A husband that got hooked
on Persocoms, huh?

443
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,166
Making a real girl cry.

444
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,033
He still prefers a Persocom?

445
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:00,566
A.

446
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:01,533
Well done.

447
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,366
B.

448
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:03,366
Pretty good.

449
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,266
C.

450
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,366
Average.

451
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,033
D.

452
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,800
You're in trouble.

453
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:07,433
E.

454
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,266
Do better.

455
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,433
F.

456
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,133
Do much, much, better.

457
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,866
G.

458
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,966
Do much, much, much better!

459
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:14,900
H.

460
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,266
Me!

461
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,566
Huh?

462
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,266
Next episode of Chobits: 

463
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,700
"Chi Provides."

464
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,000
Grumble.

465
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:22,966
Huh?

466
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,933
No, that was just the
sound of my stomach.
