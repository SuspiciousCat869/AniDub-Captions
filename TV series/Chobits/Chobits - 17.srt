1
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:19,900
Good morning everybody!

2
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,800
Let's do the
wakey-wakey exercises

3
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,066
with lots of energy today!

4
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,933
Time to get those arms
stretched way up in the air.

5
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,766
Uh... Sumomo I think
you can skip that today.

6
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,233
Aye.

7
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,900
Canceling wakey-wakey exercises.

8
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,733
Good morning, Hideki.

9
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,533
Good morning to you too, Chi.

10
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,100
Oh?

11
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,733
Uh? What was that?

12
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,933
Miss Hibiya?

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,033
Oh, hello Mr. Motosuwa.

14
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,466
I hope I didn't wake you;

15
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,200
I guess I was making
a bit of a racket.

16
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,233
No, don't worry;
I was already up.

17
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,066
So what are you
doing with all this stuff?

18
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,933
I'm doing a big cleaning today,

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,966
and I'm airing
out the tatami mats.

20
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,100
Oh, I see. That's quite a job.

21
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,200
Chi?

22
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,100
Are you sure you
really don't mind?

23
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,833
After all you've done for us?

24
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,966
Of course not!

25
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,033
Chi!

26
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,500
It might be helpful to
have a guy like me around

27
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,100
if you're cleaning up
the whole building.

28
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,033
Chi!

29
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,633
So if it's okay with you,
just let me know

30
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,266
what I can do
starting right now.

31
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,133
Chi!

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,900
Thank you, that's
very nice of you.

33
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,000
Then, I guess
I will ask you for help.

34
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,166
Just leave it to me!

35
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:44,300
Chi? Chi, chi, chi.

36
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,633
Hooray, hooray!

37
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,966
Go, go, go, go, go!

38
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,400
Dust! I see dust, I see dust!

39
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,133
Huh? Where is it, Sumomo?

40
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,766
Right there! Right there!

41
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,466
Oh.

42
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,433
There we go.

43
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,933
Over there, too!

44
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,200
Chi.

45
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,300
And that's how you do it.

46
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:13,366
You want to give it a try?

47
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,333
Chi!

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
All right, let's do our
best to clean them!

49
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,600
Chi will do her best!

50
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,733
It's time to get cleaning!

51
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,133
Chi.

52
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,033
Okay, and now we do the outside.

53
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,233
You just stay right
there and watch.

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,033
And I-

55
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,566
Is Hideki all right?

56
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,333
He fell.

57
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,400
Pull it, pull it, that's
the way, that's the way!

58
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,766
Pull it, pull it, that's the
way, that's the way.

59
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:12,400
Pull it, pull it, that's
the way, that's the way...

60
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,566
Yay, you did it! You did it!

61
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,966
That's the way!

62
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,800
Chi.

63
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,533
Chi. Chi.

64
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,233
Chi.

65
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,233
Here you are.

66
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,600
Ah, thank you very much.

67
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, that hits the spot!

68
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,900
Chi?

69
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh...

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,500
Chi.

71
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,866
Are you having fun, Chi?

72
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,500
Wah! Danger, danger!

73
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,766
This is crisis situation!
I repeat: a crisis situation!

74
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,533
Sumomo!

75
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,700
Somebody help me!

76
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,800
Um, sorry about that.

77
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:09,733
Chi?

78
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,633
Mr. Motosuwa?

79
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,566
Yeah?

80
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,266
I, uh, came across
a perfect outfit for Chi

81
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,266
when I was going through
some of this old stuff.

82
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you mind if
I have her try it on?

83
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,666
No, of course not.

84
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,066
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

85
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,500
This is great. Right, Chi?

86
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,933
Chi!

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,333
Well then Chi,
then do you have a minute

88
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,766
to come to my apartment?

89
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,300
Go ahead, Chi.

90
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:33,066
Just try not to cause
Miss Hibiya any trouble, okay?

91
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,166
Chi!

92
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,800
I think that just about
does it for this room.

93
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,033
All I have to do now is to bring

94
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,766
all those things
back in from the hall,

95
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,133
and I'd say we're done.

96
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,066
Hmm.

97
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,533
Come to think of it,
there's another door upstairs,

98
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
maybe that's a better place.

99
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,633
I'll be right back;
just wait here.

100
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,966
Chi.

101
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,200
Chi?

102
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,466
Sorry to keep you waiting.

103
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,366
Would you like to try this on?

104
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,633
Chi.

105
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,766
Okay, since that's
the door to the roof,

106
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,933
maybe this is a closet.

107
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,966
Excuse me, I'm coming in.

108
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,066
We're coming in!

109
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,500
Huh?

110
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,300
All done.

111
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,066
I knew that would
look nice on you.

112
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,300
Chi?

113
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:22,733
Of course, that outfit
was yours anyway,

114
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
so it should.

115
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:26,200
Chi's outfit?

116
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right, you've
forgotten everything.

117
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:34,466
Did Chi forget about something?

118
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,133
It's all right.

119
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,066
You should have; that's
the way he wanted it.

120
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,566
Chi?

121
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,833
What do you think is up
with all these cables?

122
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,866
Huh.

123
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,300
Well I guess I can
dust the place, anyway.

124
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,866
It could certainly use it.

125
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:59,666
Nothing strange is suddenly
gonna pop out at us, is it?

126
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,133
Time for your bath!

127
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,233
S-Sumomo!

128
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,866
Sumomo? Sumomo!

129
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:25,166
Come on, talk to me!
Sumomo! Sumomo! Sumomo!

130
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,533
Oh come on, Sumomo!

131
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,766
What do I do now?

132
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,733
It would be terrible

133
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,766
if Shinbo found out
that Sumomo was broken.

134
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:43,300
Uh, sorry, but it looks
like Sumomo sorta broke.

135
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,400
"Sorry" doesn't cut it.

136
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,733
Pay to have her fixed!

137
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,133
Hey, you gotta wake up,
Sumomo, come on!

138
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,533
Please!

139
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,200
Miss Hibiya! Miss Hibiya!

140
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:12,333
Mr. Motosuwa, is there
something the matter?

141
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,900
It's Sumomo:
she got electrocuted!

142
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,033
Oh!

143
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
I never know what to do
when things like this happen.

144
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:18,766
What do I do?

145
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,933
Mr. Motosuwa, please.

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,966
First you have to calm down.

147
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah. You're right
I gotta calm down.

148
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:26,066
That's right.

149
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,366
Now how about
some nice barley tea?

150
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:30,066
I know! I'll call Minoru!

151
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,866
He always knows what to do!

152
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:42,900
Mr. Motosuwa?

153
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:44,966
Oh, yes, hello,

154
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,633
is this the Kokubunji residence?

155
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,433
Uh, my name's Motosuwa,
is Minoru there?

156
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,933
He isn't home?

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,233
Oh, I see. Yes,
that's fine. No, no, no.

158
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,733
Thank you, thank you,
sorry to bother you.

159
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,300
Why now, of all times?

160
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,966
Is Hideki all right?

161
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,866
Oh , I'm all right,
but Sumomo...

162
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,100
Chi?

163
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,433
Aah, Chi!

164
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,166
What kind of an outfit is that?!

165
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,500
This outfit is bad one?

166
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:18,066
No, I wouldn't
call it a "bad" one,

167
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,033
as a matter of fact,

168
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,466
I think it's
actually quite pretty.

169
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,666
Chi is happy.

170
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,833
Oh.

171
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,700
So that must be the one
Miss Hibiya gave you just now.

172
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,233
Yes, Miss Manager handed to me.

173
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,666
I think it's all
right to actually say

174
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,833
that she gave it to you, Chi.

175
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,533
"Gave" is what you say
when you receive something.

176
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,066
That's right.

177
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,400
But this is Chi's.
It's Chi's outfit.

178
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,533
It's wrong to say "receive."

179
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,033
So what now?

180
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
Man, do I have to call Shinbo?

181
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,666
Yeah but the only one

182
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:50,333
who knows his number
is Sumomo, and she's...

183
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,233
Come on, Sumomo, wake up.

184
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,800
Um, Mr. Motosuwa?

185
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:58,566
If you don't mind,

186
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,066
I think I might be able to help.

187
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:00,933
Huh?

188
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,833
I can take a look
at Sumomo for you.

189
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:12,566
Let's see what's going on.

190
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,233
That's amazing.

191
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,400
Chi?

192
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,600
Well, that's good.

193
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,433
According to this,

194
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,866
it appears that
the surge protector

195
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,333
was functioning properly.

196
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,300
Surge protector?

197
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,733
She was designed to shut off

198
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,566
if there was any sudden
surge of electrical power.

199
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,100
So, as a result, all of
her data's still intact.

200
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,733
It looks like she just
passed out from the shock.

201
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,133
Sumomo? Does that
mean you're okay?

202
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:00,200
Good morning, everybody!

203
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,666
Let's do the
wakey-wakey exercises

204
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,133
with lots of energy!

205
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Somehow her clock reset
itself when she started back up.

206
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,200
I can set her to the
correct time for you.

207
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,033
Thank you; I don't
know what to say.

208
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,133
You saved the day!

209
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,666
I'm a total nitwit when
it comes to stuff like this.

210
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,733
Oh, everyone's like that
in the very beginning.

211
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,833
There, everything's fine now.

212
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,233
I'm glad you're okay, Sumomo.

213
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,800
It wouldn't be
very funny if you were

214
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,266
to break while I was taking
care of you, you know.

215
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,233
Did Mr. Shinbo go somewhere

216
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,833
on vacation or something?

217
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Well, yeah.

218
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,333
I guess you might say
that he's gone off

219
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,466
on a vacation of sorts.

220
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:38,666
I see.

221
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,933
Well, if you're planning
to keep her for a while,

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,266
I think it'd be a good idea
to set up a user password.

223
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,333
A password?

224
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,766
Yes. It's always a good idea.

225
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,066
That way, other
people won't be able

226
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,100
to use Sumomo
unless you let them.

227
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,766
As it is right now, she's set up

228
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,733
so that anyone can
use her, there's no way

229
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,200
for you to protect your
personal information.

230
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,333
Oh, I see what you mean.

231
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,366
Wow, you certainly know
a lot about Persocoms.

232
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:04,333
I suppose.

233
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,333
I used to deal with
Persocoms at my old job,

234
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,866
so I picked up a fair amount.

235
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,166
Oh, well that explains how you

236
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,766
could figure out what was
wrong with her so quickly.

237
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,600
So I guess that means that
you quit your other job?

238
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,466
That's right.

239
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,000
I see, and then
you became manager

240
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,666
of this apartment building.

241
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,633
I mean it's not like
this isn't important too,

242
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,600
but don't you think
you're wasting your talents?

243
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,100
There's a little more to it.

244
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,566
This building was originally
owned by my husband.

245
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,233
Oh, I see, your husband.

246
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,766
Miss Hibiya, you mean
you were married?!

247
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,900
Oh yes.

248
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:35,700
In fact my husband
and I used to work

249
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:38,400
in the same
Persocom-related field.

250
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:41,166
Miss Hibiya... married.

251
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,366
Chi?

252
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,000
My husband passed away.

253
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,233
I really wanted
to keep this place,

254
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,533
so I thought I'd
just manage it myself.

255
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,466
Because it was something

256
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,466
that he'd left behind.

257
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,933
Yeah, well, I can understand.

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,433
By the way...

259
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,633
If you're free tonight,

260
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,333
I'd love to have you come
over for dinner, Mr. Motosuwa.

261
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,033
Huh?

262
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,366
You were a big help today;

263
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,100
I'd like to thank you
for all the work.

264
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,000
Is that all right?

265
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,066
Well, sure!

266
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,833
I wouldn't want to pass
up an offer like that.

267
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,133
Chi.

268
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:18,666
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,566
This is all very ordinary.

270
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,366
Maybe to you, but
I only see this in pictures!

271
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,600
Do I actually get to eat this?

272
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,233
Please do.

273
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,666
Thank you; it's perfect.

274
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:37,466
Delicious!

275
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:38,800
Chi!

276
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,033
I'm so glad.

277
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,833
Hideki.

278
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,333
Oh, thank you very much, Chi.

279
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,333
Chi.

280
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,933
You know,
Mr. Motosuwa, I've noticed

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,966
that Chi seems to smile
a lot more these days.

282
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,033
Huh? You really think so?

283
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Chi?

284
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,600
Oh yes.

285
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,266
And I'm sure the reason is that
you take such good care of her.

286
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
Well...

287
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,966
Chi.

288
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:27,533
Chi is getting cuter
and cuter with every day.

289
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,066
But, because of that,

290
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,500
it's going to be
that much easier

291
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,333
for them to find her.

292
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,233
Man, that was a lot
of hard work today.

293
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,933
And I ate way too much
of that wonderful food.

294
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,933
Oh, that's right.

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I almost forgot:

296
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,500
Miss Hibiya said something
about a password.

297
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,466
Would you like to
set up a password now?

298
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,100
Oh, can I?

299
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,500
Yes, you can!

300
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:13,400
The mode is
currently set to public.

301
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,766
However, if you
register as a user,

302
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,400
you will be able to
block other people

303
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,066
from using Sumomo!

304
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,566
Would you like to create one?

305
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,633
It sounds like a good idea.

306
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,433
Fine.

307
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,966
Then please enter
a password now.

308
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,533
Well how about... "Motosuwa"?

309
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,800
I can't accept that password;
try something else.

310
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:34,833
How come?

311
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,533
Name, birthday,
telephone number, etc...

312
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,766
They're all bad.

313
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,233
It's imperative that
you pick something

314
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,400
that's not easy to figure out.

315
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,866
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

316
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,000
But you know,

317
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,600
if it's not something
easy to remember

318
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,300
like my birthday or
my phone number, how'm I-

319
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:55,733
Password now!
Password now. Password now.

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,966
Password now. Password now.

321
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,233
Password now...

322
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,466
Chobits.

323
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,033
Voice recognition.

324
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,866
Is that in hiragana?
Or in katakana?

325
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,100
Uh, what?

326
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,200
I don't recommend using

327
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,333
the same alphabet
for every letter.

328
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,466
I suggest you use
a mix of hiragana,

329
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:21,100
katakana, numbers,
and the English alphabet.

330
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,600
Oh, then let's use katakana
just for the "ch" part.

331
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:30,733
Your password is now registered!

332
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,666
Come to think of it...

333
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,800
I wonder if Chi has
a password, too?

334
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,166
Chi?

335
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:03,833
No doubt about it. That was it.

336
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,300
It's close.

337
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,233
It appears that
they're getting close,

338
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,833
just as I thought.

339
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,166
Why are Persocoms
shaped just like humans?

340
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,900
They can do almost
anything, they're helpful,

341
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,800
they're pretty, and
they're always by your side.

342
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:10,633
But then, they're
different from humans.

343
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,500
I don't get it!

344
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:13,466
Why's a guy like me

345
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,800
who couldn't get into
college and worries

346
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:17,166
all the time always finding
more things to worry about?

347
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:20,866
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Disappears."

348
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:22,333
Chi?

349
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,633
Chi. She's a
Persocom, too, right?
