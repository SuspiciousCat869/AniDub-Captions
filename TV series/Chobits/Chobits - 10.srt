1
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,833
Huh? A movie?

2
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,766
Yeah.

3
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,133
I was planning to go
with an old friend,

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,533
so I thought I'd splurge

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,233
and treat us to
some reserved seats,

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,766
but then the person
cancelled at the last minute.

7
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,966
So what you're saying is...

8
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:00,900
just you and me?

9
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,566
Yeah!

10
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh, but then
I'm sure you still have

11
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,800
to study even though you
don't have prep school, right?

12
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,166
No, I can go!

13
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,366
I mean, everything's
totally fine with me,

14
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,066
but it's just that
we'd be going alone,

15
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,533
if that's alright with you?

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,500
Is that a bad thing?

17
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:16,500
Oh no, not at all;

18
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,866
I mean as long as you're OK.

19
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,333
Oh really? Great! I'm so glad!

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
Here.

21
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,433
Okay, tomorrow it is,

22
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,033
and I'll meet you at eleven
in front of the movie theater!

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,766
Yeah, sure.

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,100
So... I guess that means...

25
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,533
A date?!

26
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,866
This is actually a date!

27
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,133
But, wait a sec...

28
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,500
This town is empty after all.

29
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:15,333
Every "person" is with "it."

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,866
They never awaken

31
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:20,000
from the fun dreams
they have with "it".

32
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,700
The time spent
with "it" are dreams.

33
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:28,800
Times so wonderful,
they feel just like dreams.

34
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:32,633
"It" will grant any
wish "people" have,

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,566
and behave however
"people" want it to.

36
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,133
"It" is not a "person,"

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,066
so "it" can become
a "person's" dream.

38
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:47,033
But, "it" has one thing
that "it" cannot do.

39
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,500
"It" cannot become a "person."

40
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,466
"It" can take a
"person's" place,

41
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,266
but never become a "person."

42
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,266
That is something
that "I" know very well.

43
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,700
"I" know, because "I" am "me."

44
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,466
I'm home, Chi!

45
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,366
Welcome home.

46
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,566
I'm sorry Chi,

47
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,300
but I need to ask Shinbo
something right now.

48
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:11,933
I'll be right back.

49
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,633
Shinbo? Hey, are you home?

50
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,833
Chi?

51
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,300
Tips, for a date?

52
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, like the ones they
have in the magazines,

53
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,233
you know what I mean.

54
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,833
What girls like,
and what they hate,

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,400
where they wanna go,
the best outfit,

56
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,633
what kind of underwear.
Things like that.

57
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,066
That's a good one.

58
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,300
Well, from my
experience, first...

59
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,300
Tell me.

60
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,266
The first thing you want to do

61
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,100
is do something about
your messed up hair.

62
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,966
Regardless of what
anybody says about it,

63
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,466
appearance is important.

64
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,900
Do something with hair.

65
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,300
When you're out on the date,

66
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,566
you've gotta compliment
her on her outfit.

67
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,200
Got it?

68
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,166
Like you really mean it!

69
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,200
Compliment her on her outfit.

70
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,633
Right, next step...

71
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,000
Get yourself a single red rose,

72
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,633
bite down on it
sideways like this,

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,633
and with a light tango step,
you do a one-handed handstand!

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,400
Single-handed handstand,
tangoing, and then?

75
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,900
It was a joke!

76
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:06,733
 Huh?

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,966
Are you for real?

78
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,333
Does that mean you've never
had a date with a girl before?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,700
So that means you're a virgin?

80
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:14,866
You think that's a problem?

81
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,100
No, it's just that now I see

82
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,733
why you're panicking like this.

83
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,966
But don't get all worked up,

84
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,133
there's only one foolproof
tip for a good date.

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,300
What is it?!

86
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:23,766
Just relax and act as much

87
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,900
like your regular self
as you possibly can.

88
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,200
Huh?

89
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,233
See, people just,
no matter how much

90
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,166
they might want to
change their personalities,

91
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,766
they can't be reprogrammed
like computers can.

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,166
Whatever happens is gonna
happen anyway, right?

93
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,566
And besides, don't you think

94
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,533
it's sorta rude to her
to be a different person

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,100
just because you're on a date?

96
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,500
That's true, but I-

97
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,533
Great. So just be yourself,

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,566
and see if you can
lose that old virginity.

99
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,600
Right.

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,600
But don't call me a virgin!

101
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,433
Be my regular self, huh...

102
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,900
Yeah, but while I'm at it,

103
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:58,300
it really wouldn't hurt to do
a little something with my hair.

104
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,566
Okay, how's that look?

105
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,133
Great, the teeth
are nice and clean.

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,133
Alright, that's not bad.

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,266
Handkerchief, wallet,
tissues, pocket map,

108
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,466
dating guide, antacids in
case of a sudden stomachache...

109
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:22,266
Okay, that should
just about do it.

110
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,966
I don't think I've
forgotten anything!

111
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,966
Hideki forgot something.

112
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,200
Huh?

113
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,433
Hideki forgot magazine.

114
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,966
Ah, no, I don't think I'm
going to be needing that, Chi.

115
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,200
Chi?

116
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,566
An entire day. Just Yumi and me.

117
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,133
It's still a little
early to get going,

118
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
but I really don't
want to be late!

119
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,900
Hideki looks happy.

120
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,266
Oh?

121
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,533
Is that how I looked?

122
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,233
Prep school makes you happy?

123
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,700
No, it isn't that.

124
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,433
I actually don't
have any classes

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,200
at prep school today, Chi.

126
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,433
I'm going out with
a girl from work.

127
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,666
Out with girl?

128
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,533
Well I know I said
I was going out,

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,633
but since it's
just the two of us,

130
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,566
I guess you'd say it's
really more like a date.

131
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,633
A "date"?
Chi doesn't understand.

132
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,200
Oh. Let's see...

133
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,066
It's when two people,
who are attracted

134
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,766
to each other,
get together and do stuff.

135
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,800
Attracted?

136
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:23,866
It means to like someone.

137
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,033
Well, I gotta go.

138
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,466
That means...

139
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,366
Hideki likes... this girl?

140
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,533
Huh?

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,833
Oh.

142
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,933
I wouldn't say "like,"

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
but she's a really great girl!

144
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,166
Okay. Well, gotta go.

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,233
Take care of yourself.

146
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:53,400
Oh, hello.

147
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,666
Are you going out by
yourself today, Mr. Motosuwa?

148
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:56,833
That's right.

149
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,333
I actually have
an errand to run.

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,500
Will Chi be staying home?

151
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:01,600
Well yeah.

152
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh... Does it look
weird or something?

153
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,800
No.

154
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,066
Well, see ya later!

155
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,466
Take care.

156
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,400
"I" begin my search once more

157
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,533
for the "one"
who's only for "me."

158
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,233
The "person" who will love "me"

159
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,833
because "I" am who "I" am.

160
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,233
The "person" who
will still love "me,"

161
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,400
even if "I" cannot
grant his dreams.

162
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,066
But...

163
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,800
Is there such a
"person" out there?

164
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,766
I hope there is.

165
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,700
Will he love "me" and only "me"?

166
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:52,300
Will he really not
seek anything from "me"?

167
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,533
If he can't love "me"
for being "me",

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,800
then he is not
the "one" for "me."

169
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:04,833
Really?

170
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,666
Really.

171
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,600
There really is someone?

172
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,500
Yes.

173
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,033
Then, where is he?

174
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,933
I'm sure he is
really close to "me."

175
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,166
Not so far away.

176
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:23,966
There must be someone
that "I" can fall in love with.

177
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,033
Chi.

178
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,633
That's strange.
Isn't this where she said?

179
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Senpai!

180
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

181
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,366
I don't know what happened.

182
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,966
No, I just happened
to get here a little early.

183
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,600
In fact, you're
right on time. See?

184
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,366
Huh?

185
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Oh, you're right!

186
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,266
Huh.

187
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,900
Look at that I wonder
how my watch got so fast?

188
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:52,966
Geez, I didn't expect that!

189
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,466
Yeah, all that
hurrying for nothing.

190
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,100
Oh, I suppose.

191
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,700
But then again,
it all worked out,

192
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:01,366
because at least I didn't make
you have to wait too long.

193
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,933
To think: my first date,
and such a cute girl, too.

194
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Life couldn't get any better!

195
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,066
By the way, Senpai,

196
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,633
isn't your hair a
little different today?

197
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,533
Yeah, um , is it weird?

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,633
No, it's nice.

199
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,333
I think it makes you
look more mature.

200
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,333
But if you ask me,

201
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
I kinda prefer it the
way you usually have it.

202
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:25,033
Oh, really?

203
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,700
Oh no, wait; please don't
do that on my account.

204
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:28,933
Oh, that's all right.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Believe me, I feel more
comfortable like this, anyway.

206
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,966
Do you mind...
if I hold onto your arm?

207
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,333
Huh?

208
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,666
I don't... want to
go home tonight.

209
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:03,966
What am I gonna do with her

210
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,833
if the whole thing
ends up like that?

211
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,300
Maybe I should take
her home anyway,

212
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,900
and tell her that her
father's gonna be worried

213
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,666
if she stays out
too late with me.

214
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,466
But wait, when a girl's
asserting herself that much.

215
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,100
And you're on a date...

216
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,866
Oh, I don't know!

217
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,000
Senpai, is something wrong?

218
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:24,366
Huh? Oh no, nothing at all.

219
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,000
But...

220
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,733
What if that "person"
doesn't love "me"?

221
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,233
What if he falls for
someone other than "me"?

222
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,500
A "person's" heart can't be
erased or copied like "it."

223
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:47,866
That's why it's hard to change
what a "person" has chosen.

224
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,600
I know.

225
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:54,433
A "person's" heart
may be easy to change,

226
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,833
but some cannot
be changed at all.

227
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,300
Feelings of love are
especially hard to change.

228
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,333
So, what would you do?

229
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,466
Then, "I" will have to decide.

230
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,433
Decide, and act upon it.

231
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,666
"I" will, with the other "me."

232
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,866
Chi hears it again.

233
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:47,266
It's calling now for Chi.

234
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:06,466
Who is it?

235
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,866
It's me.

236
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,500
Close your eyes.

237
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,666
I'll send you a vision.

238
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,266
Chi.

239
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,400
Is it "you" who
is calling to me?

240
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:29,266
Yes. "I" am the one
calling for "you."

241
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,466
Why do you have
the same face as Chi?

242
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:37,066
Because "I" am "you."

243
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Chi doesn't understand.

244
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,966
All your data is gone, isn't it?

245
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:50,133
Tell me. Who is at
"your" side right now?

246
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,233
Hideki. It was Hideki
who found Chi.

247
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,933
Chi? Is that your new name?

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
"Chi" is Chi's name.

249
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:02,566
Hideki gave Chi this name.

250
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,500
Is Hideki "the 'one' for 'me'"?

251
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:09,766
The "one" for "me"?

252
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:15,500
The "one" who will
love "me" and only "me."

253
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,433
I don't know.

254
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,466
Chi only knows things
Hideki taught her

255
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,700
after she woke up.

256
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,033
I see.

257
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,066
Then it's true: you really
have forgotten everything.

258
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:34,066
But, "I" still remember.

259
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:38,733
About "us."
About what "we" will decide.

260
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,300
Chi, "we" are now
connected again.

261
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:54,066
From now on, whatever
"you" see, do, or know.

262
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,633
Everything will come to "me."

263
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,066
"We" are together.

264
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,266
Always together.

265
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,766
I'll see you soon, Chi.

266
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,533
Wow. Boy, that's
really something.

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,466
Well, I felt I really should
put in a little extra effort,

268
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,366
Senpai, since I was
making them for you.

269
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,733
How 'bout a little coffee?

270
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,266
Oh, thanks.

271
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,066
Geez, going out to see a movie

272
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,200
with Yumi, and
then getting treated

273
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,166
to a homemade lunch
in the park, too.

274
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,533
Oh man, am I one
lucky guy, or what?

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,366
I'm sorry I'm late!

276
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,066
Hi. Alright then, you
can do the shopping now.

277
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:54,966
And when you're finished,

278
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,400
you can take it all
back to the house.

279
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,900
Yes, I understand.

280
00:15:58,466 --> 00:15:59,666
Hey, so what do you want to eat?

281
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:00,833
I'm starving!

282
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,933
How 'bout ramen?

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,700
You're kidding... again?!

284
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,100
No, I found this new place.

285
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,133
It's really good.

286
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Are you worried about something?

287
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,966
Huh?

288
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:10,966
What's that?

289
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,000
Chi, I mean.

290
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,166
That's her name, isn't it?

291
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,000
Isn't that your Persocom?

292
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,233
Now that you mention it

293
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,266
I guess I'm a little worried,

294
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,233
'cause she still can't do
much on her own yet.

295
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,033
But... she's cute, right?

296
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
Well, yeah... sorta.

297
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,966
I guess I'm a little jealous.

298
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:28,933
Huh?

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,666
It's just that Persocoms
are always so cute.

300
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,166
I wonder if you might start

301
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,666
to prefer Persocoms
more than people.

302
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:36,933
More than people?

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,366
But they're computers!

304
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,766
Of course, they're incredibly
cute and all that...

305
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,866
But they're...

306
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,000
They're what?

307
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,933
Humans are entirely different.

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,166
You think so?

309
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:47,300
Yeah.

310
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,233
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,900
That must have sounded strange.

312
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,333
Do you want to go out on a boat?

313
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,700
I'll pay for the rental
to make up for things.

314
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,066
Huh? That's all right.
Let me pay.

315
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,233
But I...

316
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,733
You already got the tickets
and made lunch for me.

317
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,100
At least let me do that. Okay?

318
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:06,900
Okay.

319
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,800
Senpai, isn't that hard work?

320
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:15,933
No, it's not very hard at all,
in fact, it feels really good.

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Huh?

322
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,533
Is something wrong?

323
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,033
Isn't that Minoru, over there?

324
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,766
Hey!

325
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,333
Hey!

326
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,666
I guess he can't hear me.

327
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,533
Hey!

328
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Senpai, watch out,
that's dangerous!

329
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,333
Hey!

330
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,666
Senpai!

331
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,533
Senpai!

332
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,866
Oh?

333
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,233
It's cold.

334
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,800
Are you all right?

335
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,266
Oh sure, I'm fine.

336
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,000
But you look so cold like that.

337
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,233
I know, I can go buy
you some new socks

338
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,733
and shoes so you won't be
wet for the rest of the day.

339
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,333
Yumi, hold on!

340
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,633
You don't have to do that!

341
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,866
I can accompany her
and guide her

342
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,900
to the nearest
appropriate store.

343
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,533
Oh, okay.

344
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,366
Go ahead. That's fine.

345
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,633
Right.

346
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,000
That girl is human, isn't she?

347
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,233
Huh? Yumi? Why, of course.

348
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,566
Why do you ask?

349
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:23,700
I'm glad.

350
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,366
Huh?

351
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:28,433
I say that because you
have such a cute Persocom.

352
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,233
I was worried you'd
become so engrossed with her,

353
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,733
it would blind you
to anything else

354
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,533
and you'd lose
interest in humans.

355
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Even you, Minoru?

356
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,100
Are you thinking the same thing?

357
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,266
The same thing?

358
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,966
That's exactly
what Yumi said to me.

359
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,466
That I might find
myself beginning

360
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,966
to prefer Persocoms
to actual people.

361
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,000
And, what did you say to that?

362
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:49,233
Well, a Persocom is
different from a human.

363
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,100
That's right.

364
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,900
I should know that...

365
00:18:54,966 --> 00:19:00,600
that computers...
are different from people.

366
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:05,000
When you say that,
do you mean Yuzuki?

367
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:05,833
What?

368
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,433
Oh, I don't mean
to pry or anything.

369
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,733
You don't have to talk about
it if you don't want to.

370
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
But you know, Minoru,

371
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,300
you do act a little differently

372
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,500
towards Yuzuki than the others.

373
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,300
Mr. Motosuwa, people often refer

374
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,933
to you as a
nice guy, don't they?

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,833
Huh? Well, I suppose.

376
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,466
But then, you're the
type who ends up...

377
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,333
the guy they like,
but not as a boyfriend.

378
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,633
Don't say that!

379
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Yuzuki is...

380
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,900
a Persocom I made to
resemble my older sister,

381
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,266
who died from an
illness two years ago.

382
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,233
Not just her appearance either,

383
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,500
but as much personality
data as I could input.

384
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,700
All my sister's habits
that I could remember,

385
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:54,766
what she hated,
what she loved...

386
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,500
Every memory of
my sister that I could find.

387
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,566
That's why Yuzuki is
just like my older sister.

388
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,033
So perfect... a resemblance...

389
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,900
Minoru...

390
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,866
But, no matter how
similar she may be,

391
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,200
it's nothing more
than a program.

392
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,066
And I know that
better than anyone,

393
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,400
because I'm the
one who made her.

394
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,200
But then, there are times

395
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:24,400
when I just want to forget that.

396
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:27,300
That Yuzuki is only a Persocom.

397
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,500
So then...

398
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,866
When we first met,
and you told me

399
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,600
to be careful not to fall
in love with a Persocom.

400
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,633
Yes.

401
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,866
That advice came
from my own experience.

402
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,133
Was I too intrusive?

403
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,033
Oh no, I didn't mean
anything like that.

404
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
Oh, that's okay.

405
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm sorry...

406
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:52,066
I never seem to know what
to say at a time like this.

407
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:56,300
That's because you
really are a nice guy.

408
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,000
By the way,
I wish you all the best

409
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,233
on losing your
virginity Mr. Motosuwa.

410
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,433
Oh, thanks.

411
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,633
Hey, wait a minute!

412
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,333
How did you find
out about that?!

413
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,266
I got an e-mail from
Mr. Shinbo last night,

414
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,966
in a font 6 times normal size.

415
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,233
That little...
Why did he hafta...

416
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,000
Seems like fun.

417
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,033
Yeah.

418
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm jealous of you, Miss Yuzuki.

419
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:18,300
Huh?

420
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:20,366
Senpai!

421
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,800
See you later.

422
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,566
So pretty.

423
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,533
Senpai?

424
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,000
There are times when he
just wants to forget about it.

425
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,366
Huh?

426
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,500
Huh? Yumi?

427
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,666
I'm home, Chi!

428
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
Welcome home.

429
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:09,966
Chi.

430
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,433
Hideki, welcome home.

431
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,700
Oh.

432
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,033
I'm home, Chi.

433
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,333
With bated breath,
I listened intently.

434
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,533
Yes, for some reason,
it wasn't after me anymore.

435
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,833
Somehow, I'd managed to escape.

436
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,066
With a sigh of relief,
I looked up into the sky,

437
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,200
and there was the living head

438
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,300
of a man floating
in mid-air, smiling!

439
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,100
Hideki? Hideki?

440
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,166
Next episode of Chobits:

441
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,266
"Chi Confirms."

442
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,100
It's alive. It's alive!
