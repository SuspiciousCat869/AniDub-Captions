1
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,533
Thank you very much!

2
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,533
I don't like the looks of that.

3
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,066
Boy, I wish I'd never
listened to that story.

4
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,733
It was a cloudy, muggy day,

5
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
with a darkness that
threatened rain any second...

6
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:05,433
The day that she was murdered.

7
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,233
She was lured by her
lover's jealous wife--

8
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,833
with his usual signal-

9
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,066
but instead of the
arms of her lover,

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,200
she found a violent
end to her life.

11
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,500
Her aching fury lives
on in that apartment,

12
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:23,533
and sends out its beckoning
signal on those same muggy days.

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,133
The signal for their meetings
that the man had used...

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,600
flashing the light on
and off, on and off,

15
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,400
waiting, even now...

16
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,966
for the arrival
of her next victim.

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,366
Hideki, welcome home.

18
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,633
Chi?

19
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,700
W-w-w-was... that story
about this apartment?

20
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,366
B-b-b-but that's impossible!

21
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,200
That's impossible!

22
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:10,566
Flashing the room
light on and off.

23
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,033
That was the signal for the
passionate rendezvous

24
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,433
of a married man
and his mistress.

25
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,000
One day, when she went
to the room as usual,

26
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,500
she found the man's
wife standing there,

27
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,700
with a kitchen knife
in clutched in her hand.

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,500
It was a cloudy, muggy day,

29
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:31,766
with a darkness that
threatened rain any second,

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,166
The day that she was murdered.

31
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,900
The woman tried to get help

32
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,833
from the man by dragging
herself toward the hall,

33
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,266
but the man had
not come for her,

34
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,633
and only her ebbing blood
ever reached the door.

35
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes, the woman was betrayed
by the man she loved.

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,266
The woman who fell to the
jealousy of her lover's wife,

37
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,500
lured by her lover's signal.

38
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,633
Her fury remains in
the room as we speak,

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,733
and sends out that signal
on those cloudy, muggy days...

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
days like the day
she was killed.

41
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,600
The signal for their
meetings that the man used...

42
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,700
Flashing the room light
on and off, on and off...

43
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:20,566
That is how she awaits for
the arrival of a new victim.

44
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:25,900
In room 104 of Apartment G.

45
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,533
Of course, most of the
stories on this website

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,466
are nothing but completely
unsubstantiated rumors.

47
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,200
But I'd have to say they do
sound pretty good

48
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,066
coming from a Persocom instead
of just some old monitor.

49
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,466
Wait, Mr. Motosuwa.

50
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,100
You asked me about the internet;

51
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,300
I thought you wanted to know.

52
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,700
Yeah, but I gotta go
to the bathroom...

53
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,000
Wait, that story's
just like the one I heard

54
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,466
over at Minoru's place.

55
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,266
Yeah, b-but that's impossible.

56
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,966
No matter how
cloudy it is today,

57
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,266
and even if the lights were on
in the empty room down there...

58
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,666
It just can't be.

59
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,466
Hey, Motosuwa!

60
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,400
Want to go to the baths?

61
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,133
Huh? Motosuwa?

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,533
Hideki over there.

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,033
Of all the things to do
on a gloomy day like this,

64
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,733
are you playing some
kinda creepy game?

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,666
Ready or not, here I come!

66
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,900
Master, he's scary!

67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,466
You mean that spooky
old story about Room 104?

68
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,333
Oh, sure, I've
heard about that one.

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
I've even seen the
website and everything.

70
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,766
But it's just one of
those urban legends.

71
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,766
Oh, you think so, huh?

72
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,500
But I saw it with my own eyes.

73
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:30,333
It was a flashing light in
that vacant room beneath us.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,933
And, it's apartment G.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,033
This is Gub Jogasaki after all,
that's a bit of a coincidence.

76
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,633
It's all in your mind.

77
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,633
For starters, you said it
yourself: it's a vacant room.

78
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,433
And I don't see
any lights flashing.

79
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,633
It was doing it
just a minute ago!

80
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Motosuwa.

81
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,166
You know, you're
a bigger lily-liver

82
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,366
than I'd ever thought.

83
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,433
Shinbo!

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,433
Wah! He's so scary!!

85
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,933
Will you stay here tonight?

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,966
Well, I'm not gonna stay
with a guy the whole night

87
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,400
just 'cuz he's a scaredy-
cat and can't take it!

88
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:00,700
Aw, come on, just tonight;

89
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,400
I won't do anything
weird, I promise!

90
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,433
I won't let you
do anything weird!

91
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,466
Oh god, it's morning already,
and I haven't slept a wink.

92
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,600
Hmm?

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,833
Chi?

94
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,133
Chi!

95
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,766
Chi?

96
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,033
Hideki?

97
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,200
Hideki.

98
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,033
Chi?

99
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,766
I hear something.

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,300
Chi?

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,066
No sound. Sound is all gone.

102
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
What's come over you;
what're you doing down here?!

103
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,333
I heard a sound here.

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,866
Huh?

105
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:32,733
What was that?!

106
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,833
What did I see?!
Did I just see that?

107
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,833
Hideki, what's wrong?

108
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,633
Are you sick?

109
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh...

110
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,566
No, it's all right, Chi.

111
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,833
There's nothing there,
nothing at all.

112
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,800
It's gonna be fine, don't worry,
it's OK, don't be scared.

113
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,800
I gotta thing or
two to take care of,

114
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,400
so you just stick around here,
and I'll, just uh, right.

115
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,433
This is... it's getting
just like that crazy story.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,400
Hey! And whatever you do,
don't go near that room!

117
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:58,900
Now what do I do?

118
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:00,266
Should I ask the
Manager about it?

119
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,166
But how do you ask
a thing like that?

120
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,933
"Excuse me, but is
this apartment haunted?"

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,633
I'm already behind on my rent,

122
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,833
that'll make it sound
like I'm trying

123
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,633
to blackmail her or something.

124
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,100
Oh, Mr. Motosuwa,
I was wondering if...

125
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:12,966
Gah!

126
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,366
Lovely weather
we're having, huh?

127
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,633
Big dark clouds and...

128
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,866
oh, no, nothing supernatural
going on around here.

129
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:21,933
Nope, nothing like that;
normal as rain!

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,866
See you!

131
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,600
Hey wait,

132
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,333
so was that all just in my head?

133
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,933
That's true.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,400
I mean, what're the odds
it would be that place?

135
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,766
Sure, the name of
the building starts

136
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,366
with a "G," but so what?

137
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,100
It could be "Gonzales" or
"Garando" for that matter.

138
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,533
Besides, the story's
a little too good.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,633
To have the "other woman"
standing there

140
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,100
with a kitchen knife in
her hand when you walk in...

141
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,200
Uh...

142
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,266
Senpai?! Are you
all right, Senpai?!

143
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,533
Oh, sure; that makes sense.

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,933
I'm sorry I surprised
you like that.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,366
Oh no, it's nothing.

146
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm sorry to bother you
with such a screwy story!

147
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,900
I mean it's really just
a silly urban legend.

148
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,833
I know it's pretty dumb

149
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,600
to believe in stuff
like that at my age.

150
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,033
Oh, I totally disagree!

151
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,033
Huh?

152
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,333
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it;

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm scared of the color black!

154
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,500
Just black? How come?

155
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:27,133
I mean crows, black cats, bats.

156
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,733
They seem to be bad luck.

157
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,700
And, don't you think
they look a little scary?

158
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:31,900
Mm-a little bit.

159
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,466
I think everyone's
putting up a brave front

160
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,733
when in reality,
they're paranoid.

161
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,633
So when you think about it,

162
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,300
there's no reason to be worried.

163
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,300
Yumi, I...

164
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:42,433
Hmm?

165
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,266
I was just a little
surprised, that's all;

166
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,533
you really don't have to worry
about me so much, okay?

167
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,200
Okay, but that's
not what I meant.

168
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,200
The other day, after
going to the movies,

169
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,533
I felt really bad,
because I left

170
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
without saying good-bye
to you or anything.

171
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,066
Oh, well I didn't...

172
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm really sorry about that!

173
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,300
Oh, don't let that bother you;

174
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,733
I just thought you must've been
in a big hurry to get somewhere.

175
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,133
And...

176
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,733
Maybe we could go out again
sometime, if you'd like to...?

177
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,966
My Pleasure!

178
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,000
Ahh!

179
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,633
Senpai?

180
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,166
Are you gonna be okay Senpai?

181
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,966
Sheesh! That's enough
cowardice out of you!

182
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,966
A spooky story's one thing,

183
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,766
but what about a
true friend who sacrifices

184
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,966
his back to carry
you all the way home.

185
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,033
Don't say things like that.

186
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,900
Hideki.

187
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,033
I'm sorry, Shinbo.

188
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,566
But you know,
my passing out didn't have

189
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,266
much to do with that story.

190
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,833
Listen to yourself.
Just think about it.

191
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,766
First of all,
I'd like to point out,

192
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,833
there's no room 104
in the building.

193
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Huh?

194
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:48,466
There are only 3 rooms
on the first floor. Right?

195
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,233
Okay, when you come,

196
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,766
the manager's room's on
the left; that's room 101.

197
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,400
Then to the right,
there are only two rooms.

198
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,966
So, where would room 104 be?

199
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,300
Oh.

200
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,366
Once ya figure that out,

201
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:03,433
the story sorta falls apart,
doesn't it? See ya!

202
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,466
Hideki still hurts?

203
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,733
Huh? No, the pain's
all gone, Chi.

204
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,700
Hideki, is scared of that room?

205
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,533
Huh? Well, it's uh...

206
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,233
Chi will check it.

207
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,700
Huh?

208
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,833
But, Chi...

209
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
First of all,
I'd like to point out,

210
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,266
there's no room 104
in the building.

211
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,933
Chi, wait for me!

212
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,166
Let's see...

213
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,033
All right, then.

214
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,633
So if there really
isn't a room 104,

215
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
at least one part of the story
doesn't hold up.

216
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,800
There are 3 rooms
on the first floor.

217
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,900
Miss Hibiya's apartment
is off to the left,

218
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,166
that's room 101.

219
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:47,100
Then over here
are the other two...

220
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,700
102 and 103...

221
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,700
Just your basic
unoccupied apartment.

222
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,700
Looks pretty harmless to me!

223
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,633
I'm such an idiot.

224
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,466
Huh? Was that a blackout?

225
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,866
Didja hear the
thunder just then?

226
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,400
The storm's coming this way.

227
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:25,433
What's that?

228
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,000
Where's Chi?

229
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,766
Hey, Chi!

230
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,866
She wouldn't...

231
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,400
Chi?!

232
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,766
What are you up
to all of a sudden?

233
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,200
It's dangerous by that door.

234
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,000
Chi?

235
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,366
Ow.

236
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,333
Huh?

237
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,500
Just a dream... Thank goodness.

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,700
Hey, Motosuwa!

239
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:11,266
Rise and shine sleepyhead;

240
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,800
it's almost noon after all.

241
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,166
Time to go to prep school

242
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,933
and do our best again today!

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
Oh no, it's that late already?!

244
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,233
I'm gonna go on ahead!

245
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,466
See you later!

246
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:21,900
Chi.

247
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,533
Oh, Chi, sorry I woke you up.

248
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,300
I gotta get going!
I'm gonna be late!

249
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,233
Where is Hideki going?

250
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,266
What do you mean? Prep school.

251
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,633
But that's...

252
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,166
Room 104.

253
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:36,933
Here you go!

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,933
Huh?

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,766
I hope you like
vanilla ice cream.

256
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,900
But... How'd I...?

257
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:42,900
Hey, come on.

258
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,333
It was all your idea to
bring me here after all.

259
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,533
You said you'd like to go
out with me again sometime!

260
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,566
Oh, oh really?

261
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,833
And it is a
perfect day, isn't it?

262
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,833
Yeah.

263
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,533
Hey! That looks
like so much fun!

264
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,966
Let's get a boat!

265
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,733
This is great.

266
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,133
It's really nice to
do things like this

267
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
every once in a while.

268
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,233
Isn't it though?

269
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
I just love doing
stuff like this!

270
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,233
The light streaming through
the trees like that...

271
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,266
It's almost like
being back home.

272
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,566
You're in for a treat then.

273
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,466
There's an even
prettier place up ahead.

274
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,333
Huh.

275
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,066
It's an old apartment.

276
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:20,000
But the light in the
first floor window

277
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,966
flashes on and off! On and off.

278
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,400
Mr. Motosuwa!

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,600
Huh?

280
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,666
What do you mean, "huh"?

281
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,866
Be careful, it's dangerous
spacing out like that!

282
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:41,566
Oh, Miss Shimizu!
Thank you very much.

283
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,900
You know, you've been
acting a little strange lately.

284
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,700
Is something wrong?

285
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:47,600
Huh? No, not really.

286
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh.

287
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:53,566
I get it, it's not something
you'd want to talk to me about.

288
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,166
I guess to you, I'm just...

289
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,066
an instructor at a prep school.

290
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,333
Huh?

291
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,766
Hey, do you want
to go get a drink?

292
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,266
Huh?

293
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,533
Come on, let's go!

294
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,366
Anyway, there's
something I've been wanting

295
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,233
to ask you about.

296
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,200
Uh, Miss Shimizu,
is this all right?

297
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,700
I mean, you know:
just the two us, and like...

298
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:14,966
Oh, don't be silly.

299
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,033
Come on; I know just the place.

300
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,466
See? It's right here.

301
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,700
I've been thinking just
how much I wanted

302
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,900
to bring you to
this place, Motosuwa.

303
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,200
M-Miss Shimizu.

304
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,700
Miss Shimizu, don't do it!

305
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,500
Do what?!

306
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,233
So then... It was a dream?

307
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,600
What's up with you this time?

308
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,833
From now on, try and have
your nightmares at home.

309
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,366
Now go wash your face.

310
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:48,533
Right... I'm sorry, thank you.

311
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,933
Hey, watch it!
This is the third floor!

312
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:53,633
Here.

313
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,900
Oh, thanks.

314
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,500
I haven't had a decent night's
sleep since I first heard it.

315
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:58,766
Ya look like it, too.

316
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,166
It's this Room 104.

317
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,133
Asleep or awake, I can't
get it out of my mind.

318
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,666
It just won't leave me alone.

319
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,633
Please, Shinbo!
You gotta sleep with me!

320
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
Right. Totally lost it.

321
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:12,366
Motosuwa! Time to exorcise
that demon of yours.

322
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,500
So...

323
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,800
What exactly brought
you to my place?

324
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,600
Are you saying that
Mr. Motosuwa's paranoia

325
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,866
is somehow my fault?

326
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,266
No, I wasn't saying that.

327
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,700
But I thought if we
could track down

328
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:24,366
the origin of the story, it
might just do a world of good

329
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,933
here to ease his troubled mind.

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
The origin of the story?

331
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,366
The best thing to do would
be simply to take

332
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,100
most of the spooky stories
on the web with a grain of salt.

333
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,933
I know, but humor
me this one time.

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,933
Room 104.

335
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,700
Why does it have to be Room 104?

336
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:40,333
Motosuwa, try and cheer up.

337
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,966
Life is filled with mysteries

338
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,033
and seemingly
supernatural happenings,

339
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
but the overwhelming majority

340
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,400
are just illusions
or natural phenomena.

341
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,400
Sure.

342
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,266
But not this; I know
I really heard it.

343
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,166
This tortured,
endless dragging...

344
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,700
Then I saw that thick,
dark puddle

345
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,966
of blood slowly seeping out.

346
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,200
I saw it with my own eyes!

347
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,400
I must say that
your witnessing of it

348
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,300
is one of the least
compelling facts.

349
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,500
Huh?

350
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,933
Humans are blessed with an
intriguing structural ability:

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
They tend to see things
they'd subconsciously

352
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,533
like to see rather than
what's really there.

353
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,533
As a result...

354
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,266
But, I really saw it!

355
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,500
It shouldn't have been there,

356
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,566
but I saw a Room 104
with my very own eyes.

357
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,200
You know, Mr. Motosuwa...

358
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,533
That story was about
Gub Jogasaki after all!

359
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,100
It was, it was, I know it was!

360
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,033
Then, let's go
look at it together.

361
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,700
Huh?

362
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,166
To Gub Jogasaki.

363
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:31,333
Looking at it like this, it's
definitely got that feeling.

364
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,966
Yeah, well I can do without
that kind of feeling!

365
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,700
And why'd we have to have

366
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,000
this kind of weather,
especially now?

367
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,566
If it's really a
supernatural phenomenon,

368
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,066
it's the perfect weather.

369
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:43,933
Hideki!

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,900
Hmm?

371
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:45,733
Chi!

372
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,700
Welcome home!

373
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,066
Oh, Chi!
You're all right after all!

374
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,166
I'm so glad!

375
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,666
Of course she'd be all right.

376
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,766
So which one is
the room in question?

377
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,833
Oh...

378
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,966
The one on the left here's
our Manager's apartment;

379
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,466
so that would be Room 101.

380
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:01,766
Then over there on the right,
there are the two empty ones.

381
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,300
And the one where Motosuwa
saw the lights flashing

382
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,500
would be that corner
one on the far end.

383
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,300
Excuse me, Mr. Motosuwa,

384
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:09,666
but when you saw it,
were you...?

385
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,166
I-I was alone.

386
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,200
Have you ever seen
it happen, Mr. Shinbo?

387
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,233
Uh, nope.

388
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,033
Sumomo hasn't seen it either!

389
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,233
Yes, well, all the more reason

390
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,466
to assume it's just
some kind of mistake.

391
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,533
It was just like that!

392
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,833
Shh!

393
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,466
Hideki, are you
scared of that sound?

394
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:46,833
This takes away the scary?

395
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,233
Enougha this, I'm gonna go
in and check it out myself.

396
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,800
You stay here and
keep your eyes peeled

397
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,433
in case somebody
tries to get away.

398
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,200
Hey, Shinbo!

399
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,766
Geez, talk about a tacky prank.

400
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,566
When I get my hands
on whoever did it...

401
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,833
Mr. Shinbo should
be back by now.

402
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,366
Do ya think...?

403
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,166
Let's go.

404
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,766
Shinbo?

405
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,300
We should check
upstairs. Come on.

406
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,633
Right.

407
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
Huh? Wait!

408
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,500
Chi?!

409
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:26,700
There.

410
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,033
T-There?!

411
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,466
Chi!

412
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,733
M-My body won't move!

413
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,066
Chi, don't go.

414
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,133
Move! Move!
What am I doing here?!

415
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:49,600
Chi... She's...

416
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,866
Chi!

417
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,466
Huh?

418
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,700
The closet?

419
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,333
Oh sure, you can get a lot
of mold this time of year,

420
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,533
because of the humidity.

421
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,266
So I thought it was a good time
for some serious cleaning.

422
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,100
But the light bulb
was about to give out,

423
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,066
and I needed to see
what I was doing.

424
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,400
I tried all sorts of things,

425
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,933
like a stepstool and a table,

426
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,633
so I could get up
high enough to change it,

427
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,100
but I just couldn't reach it.

428
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,233
And since I'm taller,

429
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,166
she called me over to
give her a hand with it.

430
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,333
And the replacement
is now complete!

431
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,166
But, I saw it; what
about that dark liquid

432
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,833
coming out from under the door?

433
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,566
Oh, well, you see
when I moved the table,

434
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,800
I happened to accidentally
knock the bucket over.

435
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,066
That was when I came
over to your place

436
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,833
to ask you for some
help, Mr. Motosuwa,

437
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,266
but you seemed
rather busy at the time.

438
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:46,100
Light bulb... Table... Bucket?

439
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,866
Okay, but it said Room 104;

440
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,433
anyone care to explain that one?

441
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,600
It's safe to assume they divided

442
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,066
the first into four
rooms at one time.

443
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,233
You'll notice the number

444
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
on the next apartment is 103.

445
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,533
Yes, I did a rather
extensive remodel

446
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,366
when I first
became manager here.

447
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,533
And that means that the missing

448
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
room number is apartment 102!

449
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,400
Hideki?

450
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:06,566
Are you all right?

451
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:10,200
Why do things like this
happen to me all the time?

452
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,566
I feel so dumb.

453
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,700
Hideki not scared now?

454
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,500
No, that's all ancient history.

455
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,266
Chi very glad.

456
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,566
Oh... Chi.

457
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,766
Well, wonder what he's getting
in the mood for now, huh?

458
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,400
That's not true!

459
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:27,600
But I am glad.

460
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,100
What really got me
scared though was

461
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,866
when I started to believe
that Chi might suddenly

462
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,100
become possessed
or something like that.

463
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,700
Lord Minoru, you look strange.

464
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,700
Is something wrong?

465
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,033
Hmm? No, I'm quite glad.

466
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,466
...that nothing really
happened after all.

467
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,233
Nothing like that
blue morning sky!

468
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,933
No, wait. Where's Chi?

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,300
Could she...?

470
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,100
Hideki! Good morning!

471
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,966
Ah!

472
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Chi?

473
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,166
Hideki? Sleeps some more?

474
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,333
Good night!

475
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:10,166
Chi?

476
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,966
Chi hears it again.

477
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Ta-dah!

478
00:23:57,766 --> 00:24:00,300
This DVD player is great;
it can even play games!

479
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:02,066
And, of course,
anything you watch on it

480
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,766
has incredible picture quality.

481
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,533
Hideki, face is red.

482
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,433
Uh, okay then,
let's play a game!

483
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,666
Chi!

484
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,833
All software's 20% off at the
store by the train station.

485
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Hideki, face is red again!

486
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:15,100
A game, right? A game!

487
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:15,800
