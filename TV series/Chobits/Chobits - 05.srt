1
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,333
Well class, that's it for today.

2
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,300
And a reminder,
this Sunday will be

3
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,800
our first practice
college entrance exam!

4
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,700
I certainly hope you've all
studied and are ready for it.

5
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,800
It'll be a strong indicator of
how you'll do on the real thing.

6
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:05,166
With a good score,
you might even want

7
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,300
to change the school
you're applying to!

8
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:08,933
Now, this test is
really important,

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,266
so do your best!

10
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,300
And if you need a
little more motivation...

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,200
...those of you who don't do
too well on this examination,

12
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,933
will be the first
ones I start calling

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,700
on in class from now on!

14
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,933
No way!

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,633
Hey, no problem for me,

16
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,233
'cause I'm gonna ace that thing!

17
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,500
I know you'll all do your best!

18
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,033
See you Sunday.

19
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,966
So, it's time.

20
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,366
Our first practice
entrance exam...

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
So, here's the plan:

22
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,133
I'm gonna take
tomorrow off from work,

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,966
and if I'm able to buckle
down and concentrate all day...

24
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:58,766
Senpai!

25
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,366
Huh?

26
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,933
Yumi!

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,233
I couldn't help but hear you
talking to yourself again!

28
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,333
Gah!

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,566
I have to do something
about this habit of mine...

30
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,300
So you really need
to concentrate.

31
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,800
Mind if I ask on what?

32
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,366
Well, I have to study.

33
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,700
You have to study?

34
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:17,633
I have a practice
entrance exam in two days.

35
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,600
So, I thought I better
take a day off from work

36
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,166
and seriously hit the books.

37
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,966
Taking a day off from work?

38
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,300
Is this practice exam really
going to be that difficult?

39
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, it's an important
one that'll let me know

40
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,266
if I'm on the right track
to get into college.

41
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,333
But the curriculum at the
prep school is pretty tough,

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,666
and it's really hard
for me to keep up!

43
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,333
And they really keep me running

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,433
so much around here,

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,866
by the time I get home
all I can do is sleep.

46
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,000
And so for tomorrow,
the day before the exam,

47
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,733
I'm going to stay home and
concentrate on studying!

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Wow, you're serious.

49
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,566
Well, I know you're going
to do just great, Senpai!

50
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,066
Thanks, Yumi.

51
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:59,300
I, uh, I think you
made me blush, somehow.

52
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,300
All right, time to open up!

53
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,433
Oh.

54
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
My Pleasure!

55
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,133
I'm home!

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,133
Chi.

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,633
Hideki, welcome home!

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, it's good to be home, Chi!

59
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,266
Chi. Chi.

60
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,266
Oops. I dropped my stuff.

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,266
Chi?

62
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,633
Oh, these are
the textbooks I use

63
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,033
for the prep school I go to.

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,500
And they're very important
things to study with, Chi.

65
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,300
To "stuh dee"?

66
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,600
Well, "to study"
means to-to work hard

67
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,366
at learning things
you don't know yet,

68
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,133
or things that are new
and unfamiliar to you.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,733
Well, that's easy to say...

70
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
...but it's pretty tough to do!

71
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,233
Study is tough.

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,166
That's right!

73
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,866
So I'm gonna have
to really hit the books

74
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,266
and study hard all
day long tomorrow!

75
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,800
It'll help me a lot
if you cheer me on, Chi.

76
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:55,966
Chi.

77
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,700
All right! Let's get going!

78
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,666
Let's see.

79
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,233
Hmmm...

80
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,366
Hmmm...

81
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,966
No! I'm not gonna lose focus!

82
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,333
Mmm...

83
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,433
Mmm...

84
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,400
Chi.

85
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,000
Hmm...

86
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,400
Chi.

87
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:44,933
It's no good!

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,666
Chi!

89
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,466
No, no, no!

90
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,466
I've gotta keep working on this!

91
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,366
I just don't get it!

92
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,233
Chi-i-i-i!

93
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,200
One, two, three, four!

94
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,500
Two, two, three, four!

95
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,333
Now!

96
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,333
Hm, hm, hm...

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Chi, chi, chi...

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, I can't say that
it was too much fun.

99
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,633
But I feel pretty
good about that!

100
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,133
Hmm!

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,033
Chi!

102
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,133
Now for English.

103
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,166
I am definitely not
good at this subject.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,366
And look at this textbook,

105
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,533
it's about as thick
as a cement block!

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,533
But right now,

107
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,466
my biggest roadblock is
this piece of work here.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
If I can do half before dinner,

109
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,533
I think I can still
get it all done today.

110
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,666
Yes!

111
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,633
Wait a second, what's
this word "respect,"

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,000
what's the definition
of the word "respect"?

113
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Argh! Where's my dictionary?

114
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,000
Chi, Chi.

115
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,333
You know, Chi,

116
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,300
I'm really not playing
around, right now.

117
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,300
Chi.

118
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,033
I'm looking for my dictionary.

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,433
Chi.

120
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,966
Hm?

121
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,200
Come to think, I haven't seen

122
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,766
that dictionary
since I moved in here.

123
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,133
I haven't unpacked
these boxes yet.

124
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,233
Hmm... Guess that shows how much

125
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,400
I've been avoiding English.

126
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,266
Chi.

127
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,666
Let's see, dictionary,
dictionary...

128
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,866
Huh?!

129
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,266
That's impossible!

130
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,466
Gone, gone, gone, gone!

131
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,966
It's really gone!

132
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:42,466
I must've left my
dictionary back home.

133
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,866
This is the worst.

134
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,633
Arrrgh!

135
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,866
Why didn't I think
of this before now?!

136
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,366
Chi!

137
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,933
I can't possibly learn
English like this!

138
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,433
I'm such a stupid idiot!

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,900
Chi! Chi!

140
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,800
Geez, it's the day
before the practice exam.

141
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,000
What's the matter with me?

142
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,233
I can't believe
I'm so unprepared!

143
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,366
Let's see...

144
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,500
Here it is. Yeah, this one.

145
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:24,533
Dictionaries are
expensive, aren't they?

146
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:28,366
Well I know it's painful,

147
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,800
but now I can get back
to studying for the exam.

148
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,233
And I'm gonna do my best

149
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,966
with English,
just see if I don't!

150
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:38,200
Hmm?

151
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,400
What is it?

152
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,066
Chi?

153
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,966
Chi!

154
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,133
I see now. This must
be the first time

155
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,133
you've ever been in a bookstore!

156
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,266
Chi?

157
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,466
This place is a bookstore.

158
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,900
They sell lots
and lots of books.

159
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,233
"Books"?

160
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,133
Let's see, books are like...

161
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,300
paper databanks
with stuff in them.

162
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:02,933
There's all sorts of stuff
in them- amusing stuff,

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
useful stuff,
all kinds of stuff.

164
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:10,133
Bookstore...
Lots and lots of books.

165
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,866
Hm?

166
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,466
Chi?

167
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,733
Would you like this book, Chi?

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,233
Chi?

169
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,600
That much for a picture book?

170
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,166
But I don't have enough

171
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,500
to get this and
the dictionary too.

172
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,166
Gah!

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,000
The dictionary...
English... The exam...

174
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,133
It's a present for you.

175
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,366
It's a present?

176
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,900
I'm going to buy this for you.

177
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,366
Buy for Chi?

178
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,400
Yeah.

179
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,533
There are all kinds
of useful things

180
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,900
you can learn from books.

181
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:14,933
You can learn a lot more than

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
from someone like me
trying to teach you stuff.

183
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,933
Hideki!

184
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,166
At times like this it's usually

185
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,233
considered proper
to say "Thank you."

186
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you, Hideki!

187
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,533
She's just so darn cute
when she's happy!

188
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,433
Uh?

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,066
Excuse me, Sir,
perhaps you could make

190
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,433
your purchase first,
and then do your love scene

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,733
from Romeo and Juliet?

192
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,933
Of course, yeah!

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,500
Ah-ha-ha-haa!
I'm embarrassed again. Huh?

194
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,766
Well actually,
that reminds me...

195
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,300
This is the first time you've
ever read a book, isn't it?

196
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:57,766
Chi. Chi.

197
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,933
All right, Chi.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,533
Picture books are actually
really easy to handle.

199
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,366
See, over here on this page,
you've got some words, right?

200
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:05,433
Chi.

201
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,433
And then right over here,
you've got the pictures.

202
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:08,833
When you put them together,

203
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,300
the pictures and
the words tell a story.

204
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:14,000
So are you able
to read the words?

205
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:18,433
The town was completely...

206
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,833
Chi, are you reading
those words by yourself?

207
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,700
You are so smart!

208
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,800
Chi-i-i-i.

209
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,866
Okay, try reading a whole page.

210
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,166
Chi!

211
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,733
The town...

212
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,733
 ...was completely empty.

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Hey, Motosuwa! How's it goin'?

214
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,733
Sh-Shinbo!

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Oh, so now you're back
to being lovey-dovey again?

216
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,100
No! No, it's nothing like that!

217
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:45,600
Tch!

218
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,566
You're so boring.

219
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,600
Huh?

220
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,600
And here we came all
this way to cheer you up!

221
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,600
Came to cheer me up?

222
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:53,333
Sumomo.

223
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,266
Aye!

224
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,166
Motosuwa! Motosuwa!
Do your best!

225
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,966
Motosuwa! Motosuwa!
Never gonna rest!

226
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,533
Study real hard and
you'll pass that test!

227
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
Ah!

228
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:07,333
I'm supposed to be studying!

229
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,666
But I can't, 'cause
I don't have a dictionary.

230
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,000
Dictionary? Whattya mean?

231
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:13,033
I forgot my dictionary
back at home,

232
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,600
and I haven't been able to study

233
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,200
for the English part of
the entrance examination.

234
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,866
Hey no sweat,
you wanna borrow mine?

235
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,100
Huh? Really?

236
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,400
But what are you going
to do about studying?

237
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,200
Well, it's like this:
I always make sure

238
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,700
I keep up with the assignments,

239
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:28,666
so I don't find myself
in that position, Motosuwa.

240
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,933
Oh there he goes,
being all unstressed again.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,766
Hmm?

242
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,633
Oh, don't' worry,

243
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,366
it's nothing,
Mr. Shinbo, nevermind.

244
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,966
Well, come on over to
my place and pick it up.

245
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,800
I really appreciate this.

246
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,033
Chi.

247
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,033
It's all right, Chi.

248
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,200
I'll be coming right back.

249
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,833
Chi.

250
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:03,900
Here y'go.

251
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,400
Thanks...

252
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,933
Okay, let's see now,
"respect" from the Latin,

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
it's defined as
"to have a high regard."

254
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,133
Is somethin' the the matter?

255
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,633
How many ways am
I supposed to use the word?

256
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,633
That's not a problem, see.

257
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,000
Look, check it out.

258
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,700
It's the difference of
whether you're gonna use it

259
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:25,166
as a verb, or if you're
gonna use it as a noun.

260
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,366
I see.

261
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,133
Then, what about
as an adjective?

262
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,366
Then that would be
"respectable."

263
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,733
"The town with no people.

264
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,700
The town was...

265
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,866
...completely empty.

266
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,266
There were houses,

267
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,166
and lights could be
seen from the windows.

268
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:13,200
But, nobody was out
in the streets.

269
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:17,400
I tried peeking in
from the window.

270
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:23,033
There was someone there,
but he was together with it.

271
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:28,366
I looked in the other houses.

272
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,433
They all were together with it.

273
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,800
Because it's fun to be with it.

274
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:40,933
It's more fun than
to be with people.

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,666
So, nobody comes out now.

276
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,933
This town is empty.

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,466
I am going on a journey.

278
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:56,066
I am going to go
to another town.

279
00:14:56,133 --> 00:15:00,166
I think it would be nice
for someone to find me.

280
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,466
But, if the one that is meant

281
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,800
for me should one day happen
to fall in love with only me,

282
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,200
that will be the day

283
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,333
when I will have
to part with the one

284
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,900
that is for me and only me.

285
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,966
Still, I want to meet the one

286
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,100
that is for me and only me.

287
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,900
That is what I think as I walk

288
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:27,033
through the town with no people.

289
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:44,166
 I... I... I...

290
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,266
Mm-hm.

291
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,900
I think I'm starting to
get it a little bit now,

292
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,000
so I guess I'm gonna
try the rest on my own.

293
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:53,800
Great!

294
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,766
Go, go, Let's go, Motosuwa!

295
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,366
Thanks for the vote of
confidence, Sumomo!

296
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,100
Hey, I'm back. Uh, Chi?

297
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,900
Chi! Chi!

298
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,166
Chi!

299
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,600
What's the matter with you, Chi?

300
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,700
Chi.

301
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,933
Chi?

302
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,666
What was that?
Are you all right, Chi?

303
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,300
Uh, what happened?

304
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,966
Chi.

305
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,700
Huhhh.

306
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,100
Well, I can't find anything

307
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,300
at all in the
easily visible areas.

308
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,833
I see.

309
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,766
But the thing is,

310
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,266
this is a very unique,
unusual Persocom.

311
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,233
To be honest with you,

312
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,766
I don't have even
the slightest idea

313
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,066
what happened to it.

314
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,600
Or what could even
cause something like this.

315
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,566
So you have no idea.

316
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:10,466
Anyway, don't stress over it.

317
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,700
Have her take it easy
for a little while,

318
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,933
and if nothing else happens,
she'll probably be fine.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
She seems to be
working okay right now.

320
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,200
Thanks a lot.

321
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,900
You've got to be getting tired
of saving me all the time.

322
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,700
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

323
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,200
Do your best, Motosuwa!

324
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,733
Mm.

325
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,700
I'll go back to my place now,
so see you later.

326
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,733
G'nite, Shinbo,
and thanks again.

327
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,933
Hideki, is all right?

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,766
It's nothing.
I'm perfectly fine.

329
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,200
Chi.

330
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,466
Huh...

331
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,066
Wow, this is tougher
reading than I thought!

332
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:01,133
Chi, did you read this book?
The whole thing?

333
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,533
Chi.

334
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,266
Huh?

335
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:11,766
Ah! How could it be
so late already?! No!

336
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,433
I was planning to get
through at least half

337
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,333
the assignment before dinner!

338
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,366
I haven't gotten anywhere
at all in my studying!

339
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,566
Chi! Chi!

340
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,200
I have no concentration at all!

341
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,533
None! I'm such a chowderhead!

342
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,133
Even if I start right now,

343
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm not going to make it.

344
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,666
I'm a failure,
I'm never gonna pass.

345
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,600
Huh?

346
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,100
Chi-i-i-i?

347
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,500
It's all right,
Chi, don't worry.

348
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,666
Chi?

349
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,266
Do your best!

350
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,766
Huh?

351
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,333
Hideki, do your best!

352
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:09,866
Chi, I-

353
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:13,600
Chi!

354
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,333
All right, I get it, Chi!

355
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,933
I see you're not gonna let me
give up just yet, are you?

356
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
Mm-hm!

357
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,766
Chi?

358
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,633
Umm... hmm... hmm... hmm...

359
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,766
Mmm!

360
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,800
Mm! Mm!

361
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,866
Hideki, do your best!

362
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,333
Huh?

363
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,833
Alright! I'll give
it another shot!

364
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,400
Chi.

365
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,100
Oh, I don't get this.
Chi, can you say it again?

366
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,766
Hideki, do your best!

367
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,533
All right, I've still
got the fighting spirit!

368
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,333
It's no use, Chi.

369
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,233
Hideki, do your best!

370
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,366
Right!

371
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,700
Chi, once more?

372
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,700
Hideki, do your best!

373
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,266
Chi!

374
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,133
Hideki, do your best!

375
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,100
All right, class, time's up!

376
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,700
Please pass your
exams to the front.

377
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,000
Ah! That was tough!

378
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,100
Whatcha gonna do now?

379
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,500
Well, I gotta go to work!

380
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,000
Good morning!

381
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh, hey there, Yumi.

382
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:54,066
How are you doin' today?

383
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,533
So, how'd you do?

384
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,833
Uh...

385
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,866
Mm!

386
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,100
I'm home.

387
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,700
Hideki, welcome home!

388
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,066
Chi,

389
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,966
you really helped me out!

390
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,866
Chi?

391
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,966
I can't really say
that I did perfectly

392
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:18,766
on the exam today,
but I do think I'm going

393
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,000
to get myself
a pretty decent score.

394
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:23,200
Chi?

395
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,366
It's all because of the way you

396
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,466
wouldn't let me stop,
and kept cheering me on.

397
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,533
I'm really grateful
for all your help, Chi.

398
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,266
Chi.

399
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,100
Oh, that's right.

400
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,300
When I get my next paycheck,

401
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:38,400
I was thinking
that I'd really like

402
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,933
to buy you something again,

403
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,866
so please look
forward to it, okay?

404
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,966
Chi Look forward.

405
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:53,300
But, if the one
that is meant for me

406
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:57,533
should one day happen
to fall in love with only me,

407
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,633
that will be the day
when I will have

408
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,333
to part with the one
that is for me and only me.

409
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:11,133
Still, I want to meet the one

410
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
that is for me and only me.

411
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,133
That is what I think as

412
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,766
I walk through the
town with no people.

413
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,366
Oh, my head hurts!

414
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:08,533
Hideki, did you hit your head?

415
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,833
No, no.

416
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,333
There are so many things I have

417
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,333
to worry about that
my head is spinning!

418
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,866
Head spinning?

419
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,133
No, no!

420
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
It's the electric bill, the gas,
the water, the rent, the food.

421
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,900
Ahh! What am I supposed to do?!

422
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:23,266
Chi is worried
about Hideki's head.

423
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,933
Somehow that hurts me
in a strange way.

424
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,466
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Weakens"

425
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,666
I wonder if Chi ever
gets a headache.
