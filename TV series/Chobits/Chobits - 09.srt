1
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:00,100
My paycheck from Bakery Tirol.

2
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,300
Hideki said Chi could
buy anything she wants

3
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:04,800
with this money
because it's hers.

4
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,033
But then...

5
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,266
What Chi really wants is
to give something to Hideki.

6
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,800
This is a bookstore.

7
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,500
Lots of books.

8
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,533
Lots of study guides.

9
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,533
Lots of girlie magazines.

10
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,666
Hideki has this. He has this.

11
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,600
He has this. He has this.

12
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,366
This is one Hideki doesn't have.

13
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,500
Give this to Hideki.

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,066
I wonder if Chi's all right.

15
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,933
I know there's nothing I can do;

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,233
she insisted on
going by herself.

17
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,833
But I keep thinking about

18
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,933
what happened back
at that peep show.

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,766
No point getting
worked up about it.

20
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,200
She'll be fine; she's
learned a lot since then.

21
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,233
I hope she didn't get lost.

22
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,133
Maybe letting her
go out all by herself

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,166
wasn't such a great idea.

24
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,266
Hey!

25
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,433
Shinbo.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
There you are.

27
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:30,733
You workin' today?

28
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,666
No, I've got today
and tomorrow off.

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
So, what's up?

30
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,366
I thought I'd see if you were
into goin' to the bathhouse.

31
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,400
A bath?

32
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,766
You mean at this time of day?

33
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,300
Hey, what are you talking about?

34
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,000
That's the whole
reason it's so great.

35
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:45,800
Huh?

36
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,433
Well I just took
a bath yesterday.

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,433
Yeah well it's not
like it makes it okay

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,466
because you had
a bath last night.

39
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,366
Here, anyway, let's get going.

40
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,933
Hey!

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,300
See?

42
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,733
Ya come this time
of day, and it's empty.

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,733
We got the place
all to ourselves.

44
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,233
I'm tellin' ya it's about
as good as it gets.

45
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,200
What's the matter,
are you still worried?

46
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, don't go
being gloomy about it;

47
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,233
you're the one who let
her go by herself, ya know.

48
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,000
And she's starting to talk
a lot better too, isn't she?

49
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,100
Yeah.

50
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,633
Okay, so let's go in.

51
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Oh yeah well since
we're on the subject here:

52
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,400
I don't suppose you
bathe your Persocom?

53
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,433
Huh?

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,733
Bathe my Persocom?
What do you mean?

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,833
Oh, right.

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,300
I guess you don't know
anything about that either.

57
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,766
You see that?

58
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,466
Persocoms - 200 yen?

59
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,700
Y-You're right.

60
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,200
So you're supposed to wash
Persocoms in the bath?

61
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,666
That's the basics, man;
it's just common sense.

62
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,900
Common sense.

63
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,400
Look, when I say
bathe your computer,

64
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,266
it's not a social thing;
I mean actually cleaning it.

65
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,666
Cleaning it?

66
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:56,666
Yeah.

67
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,200
It's something you
really shouldn't put off;

68
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,233
it's a part of your
routine maintenance.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,600
So then, you bathe
your Persocom, too?

70
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,800
Sumomo?

71
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,733
Well, she's so small,
I just dunk her

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,966
in cleaning fluid and
she scrubs herself off.

73
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,000
Hmm...

74
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,533
But regular Persocoms
are human-size,

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,466
so you really need a bath.

76
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,000
After that, though,
she'll be as fresh as new.

77
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,166
I see.

78
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,766
So I just have to
bring Chi here, right?

79
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,400
Well, the thing is your Persocom

80
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,733
doesn't know how to
bathe yet, does she?

81
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Huh?

82
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,666
You see, usually you buy

83
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,700
cleaning software
and install it.

84
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,666
That way, your Persocom
learns the proper way

85
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,866
to bathe and can wash itself
without needing any help.

86
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,133
But I don't have the
money to buy software.

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,266
Then, you've got no choice,
there's only one thing to do.

88
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,866
What's that?

89
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,833
You'll just have
to wash her yourself,

90
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,866
right here in the bath.

91
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,866
Me? You mean me wash her myself?

92
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,833
You mean here?!

93
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,166
That means I'd be naked, and...

94
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,700
and then I'd have to strip her,

95
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,366
and we'd be right here
with all the people watching,

96
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,466
and they'd all be and I'd be...

97
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,500
Are you completely
out of your mind?!

98
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,766
Come on, I was just kidding.

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,833
You'll just have to teach
her how to do it, that's all.

100
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,933
Teach her what?

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,233
How to take a bath!

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,766
Whadda ya think
I'm talkin' about?

103
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,200
She's already got learning
software installed somehow,

104
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,666
so ya just gotta teach her how,

105
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,566
and after that she can go to
the women's bath by herself.

106
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,166
That way, all ya have
to do is pay for her bath.

107
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,000
I see.

108
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,033
A bath, huh?

109
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,233
I bet a nice refreshing bath
would make Chi very happy.

110
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,033
I'm back!

111
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,533
Welcome home, Hideki!

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,633
Hi Chi, well it looks like you
were able to get home okay.

113
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,233
Hideki, Chi went shopping.

114
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,666
You know, Chi.

115
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,633
What is it Chi?

116
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,833
It's this.

117
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,266
Chi bought it for Hideki.

118
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,633
Huh?

119
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,466
So, you had to go alone,

120
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,200
'cause you were shopping for me.

121
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,033
Chi.

122
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,133
Thank you Chi; I can't
tell you how happy I am.

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,433
Chi!

124
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,433
No, Chi! Wait!

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,533
Hideki looks happy!
Hideki! Hideki!

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,033
When Hideki is happy,
Chi's face is happy too.

127
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,766
It makes Chi's mouth go up.

128
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,466
Well, that's called smiling.

129
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,400
Chi is smiling.
Is smiling a good thing?

130
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,666
Oh, absolutely.

131
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,500
It means that you're very happy.

132
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,066
Very happy.

133
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,633
I'm so happy.

134
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,366
That's right, Chi!

135
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,933
I've got something for you, too.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Well, it's not that big a deal,

137
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,600
but I'm gonna try to teach
you something really good.

138
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,766
Something good?

139
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,200
Yeah I'm gonna teach
you how to take a bath.

140
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,300
A "bath"?

141
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah, bathing is what
you do to clean your body.

142
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,566
You ready?

143
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,766
Alright, now when you
go to the bathhouse,

144
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,400
the locker room's the
first thing you're gonna see

145
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:45,900
when you step inside.

146
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,866
You got that?

147
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,266
So that's where you
take off your clothes,

148
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,266
and put them in an empty locker.

149
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,266
Oh.

150
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,100
Chi.

151
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,933
Oh, I'm sorry,
what was I thinking?

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
I should've opened
your present first.

153
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,900
This is great,
I wonder what it is?

154
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:05,000
Chi.

155
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:08,600
Hideki, you said you
wanted to get new magazines.

156
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,833
You like it?

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,266
Well, yeah, a bath,
as I was saying, uh...

158
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,500
Chi

159
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,133
Yeah, baths are where...

160
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
lions and hot water...

161
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,233
and water pouring out of their
mouths and you can just...

162
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:32,466
Hideki not happy with magazine?

163
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,400
I'm very happy with it, Chi.

164
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,066
As happy as I can be.

165
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,866
As I was saying,
a bath is like...

166
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:41,166
Hideki smiling. Chi happy.

167
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,233
A bath is...

168
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,866
You're completely hopeless!

169
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,266
I'm sorry, it's just that

170
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,366
after seeing
something like that,

171
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,433
there's no way I'm gonna
be able to teach her myself.

172
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,533
Ya gotta help me...

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,533
Please?

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,066
I've seen active
imaginations before,

175
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,933
but you take the cake.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,466
Searching the web...

177
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,033
searching the web...

178
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,833
That's a hit.

179
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,133
I found the information!

180
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,133
Good job.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,533
Now see if there's any
data you can download

182
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,933
from there that has instructions
for bathing procedures.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,033
Aye!

184
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,166
Well this should take
care of it in just a minute.

185
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,866
She's downloading the
data from the website now,

186
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,033
and when she's done, she'll
perform the actions from it.

187
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,033
You just need to have your
Persocom mimic those actions.

188
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,200
Thank you.

189
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,000
Chi, I want you to do exactly
what Sumomo does, okay?

190
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,200
Chi.

191
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
All files are good,
and download is complete.

192
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,633
Very good, now go ahead
and run the data for us.

193
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,900
Aye!

194
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:34,466
Understood. Starting now.

195
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,066
Hot, hot, hot! Oh, it's hot!

196
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,100
What's that all about?

197
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,566
Ow, hot, hot, hot!

198
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,066
Oh, hot, hot! Ooh it's hot!

199
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,233
Hot, hot, hot! It's hot!

200
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,766
Oops, I guess it's some
kinda scalding bath website.

201
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:53,366
It's hot, it's hot!
It's hot! Ah!

202
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,400
S-S-Shinbo!

203
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,700
Sumomo, not that.

204
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,533
We need software on
taking a regular bath,

205
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,700
so you can get clean.

206
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,433
Hey, wait, I can't afford
to buy any software!

207
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,366
With any luck, we'll be able to
find some Freeware.

208
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,533
Try again, Sumomo.

209
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,833
Aye!

210
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,666
Download successful!
Running program now.

211
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,566
But Sumomo, isn't that-?

212
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:17,666
The program is named:

213
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,000
"The Appropriate Manners
for Taking a Bath."

214
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,066
Rule one: coffee-flavored
milk must be drunk

215
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,333
with your hand
resting on your hip!

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,866
Chi

217
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,166
No!

218
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,833
That one's just as bad,
Sumomo; now try it again!

219
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,066
Aye!

220
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:34,366
Download is successful!
Running program now.

221
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,333
That's not it! Try again!

222
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Aye!

223
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,566
Download is successful!

224
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,800
Running program now.

225
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,233
So we couldn't figure
out how to teach her

226
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,600
to bathe last night after all.

227
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,400
Now what do I do?

228
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:54,600
Chi go to work.

229
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,533
Oh, hang on.

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,066
I'll walk you over
to the bakery.

231
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,466
The bathhouse Hideki mentioned

232
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,233
to Chi yesterday,
is Hideki going there?

233
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,533
Huh?

234
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,133
Oh yeah, that's right;
we'll go there

235
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,100
right after you get
home from work, Chi.

236
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,566
Understand.

237
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,666
Hmm?

238
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,633
Motosuwa here.

239
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,866
Hello, this is Kokubunji.

240
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,266
Oh! It's been a while, Minoru.

241
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,400
Um...

242
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,700
I don't suppose you have
some free time this afternoon?

243
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,000
Sure, I don't have
prep school today.

244
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,500
There's...

245
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,833
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

246
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
Talk? Hey, that's perfect!

247
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:33,366
I've got something that I'd
like to talk to you about too.

248
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,800
Where do you wanna meet?

249
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,900
How about 4 o'clock at Duklyon,
across from the train station?

250
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:38,633
Do you know it?

251
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,400
Yeah, that'd be fine.

252
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,466
Huh?

253
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,833
You want to know the best way

254
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,533
to teach your
Persocom how to bathe?

255
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,633
Yeah.

256
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,366
I thought I'd have Shinbo's
Persocom show her how,

257
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,933
but when we tried it yesterday,

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,700
it didn't work out very well.

259
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:11,300
What do you suppose would be

260
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,166
the best way to go about it?

261
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,400
There are many approaches,

262
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,066
but there's one simple way.

263
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,233
Yeah? Really?

264
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,966
What I mean is that it's
up to you, Mr. Motosuwa;

265
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,966
you'll have to teach
Chi how to bathe herself.

266
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,066
And down to the
very last detail.

267
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,700
I sorta tried doing that,

268
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:28,066
but all I can say is it
really didn't work out...

269
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,600
If you don't want
to buy the software,

270
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,333
you're just going to have to
accept that it's the only way.

271
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,266
Yeah, I guess that's
the only way after all.

272
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,666
Is Hideki going
to the bathhouse?

273
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:46,166
Well, she definitely
seemed happy about the idea.

274
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,366
All right! I can do it!

275
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,800
I'll give it everything I've
got and tryta teach her again!

276
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,633
And as long as
I don't let myself think

277
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,100
any bad thoughts,
it should be just fine!

278
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,400
Bad thoughts?

279
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh no, I don't mean bad,

280
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:01,666
I mean not really bad,
you know, I mean...

281
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,133
Hot!

282
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,566
Oh, that's right...

283
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,966
So what did you want
to talk about, Minoru?

284
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,366
Yes, well it was
something about Chi.

285
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,700
About Chi?

286
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,733
I told you this
before, didn't I?

287
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,100
That I was going
to post something

288
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,833
on a BBS for
custom-made Persocoms?

289
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,000
Well I did, and
I got a response to it.

290
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,266
I thought it best to tell you
about it as soon as I could.

291
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,433
Wait a minute!

292
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,833
What's this BBS thing?

293
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
It's basically just an
electronic bulletin board

294
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,733
that people use on the internet.

295
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
All sorts of people
post things there.

296
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:35,766
I never realized such
useful things even existed.

297
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,066
So that might just be the place

298
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,800
to find the best way to
teach a Persocom to bathe.

299
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,400
Huh?

300
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:43,766
Oh no, nothing, nothing at all.

301
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,800
So did someone out there

302
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,933
have something to say about Chi?

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,100
Yes, I got some
replies all right.

304
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:53,200
Oh, a reply is a post written
in response to my post.

305
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,733
Most of them were things like

306
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,466
"That's the kind of
Persocom I'd love to have!"

307
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:00,700
or "I'd like to get a chance to
check out the specs on her"...

308
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:03,366
And I also got this one e-mail

309
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,666
with an image file attachment.

310
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,500
A "file attachment"?

311
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm not sure if this
particular information

312
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,600
pertains to Chi,
but here, take a look.

313
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,400
But, this is...?

314
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,733
I agree.

315
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,133
It does appear to
be Chi, doesn't it?

316
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,266
Well, I'm not sure, but it
certainly looks like Chi.

317
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,400
But what's with these weird
things all over the place?

318
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:31,666
What's that all about?

319
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:32,833
They're some kind of connectors,

320
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,533
as far as I can tell, but
I've never seen them before.

321
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,633
Are you sure it's not a prank?

322
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,733
Maybe they think it's funny
and they're playing a game.

323
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,033
Or could be they saw
Chi out in public one time,

324
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,066
and they took a photo of her
and then doctored it up somehow.

325
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,333
It is possible.

326
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,000
But then... there's
something not quite right.

327
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,400
But don't you have any
idea where it came from?

328
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,466
You can't send an e-mail

329
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:55,366
without some kind of
return address on it, right?

330
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:56,933
So if you know what that is...

331
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Yes, there was definitely
a return address on it.

332
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,866
But every time I send a reply,
it just bounces back.

333
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:03,766
Why?

334
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,300
Either the address
is no longer in use,

335
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:06,800
so it's just a mistake,

336
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,233
or somebody sent it with
a fake e-mail address...

337
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,366
on purpose.

338
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,433
What would make someone
want to do a thing like that?

339
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,533
Perhaps the sender
preferred to remain...

340
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,900
untraceable.

341
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,766
Look at this.

342
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,166
What if the letter hidden under
the arm right here is a C?

343
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:30,433
C-H-O-B-I-T, huh.

344
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,266
Chobits?!

345
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,300
I believe I told you about them.

346
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,700
About the legendary Persocoms

347
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,700
that go by the
codename "chobits."

348
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,233
They have real
feelings and emotions,

349
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,166
and unlike other computers,
they act on their own will.

350
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,766
They have human forms,
but aren't exactly human...

351
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,533
Is that photo really Chi?

352
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,500
Is she really some

353
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,933
super powerful computer
called "Chobits"?

354
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:09,600
That was pretty funny.

355
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,333
Yes, what would you
like to see next?

356
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,633
Let's see...

357
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,833
There are so many
Persocoms around here.

358
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:31,700
Hideki!

359
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,866
Chi!

360
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:34,900
Hideki!

361
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,000
Chi!

362
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,633
Work is over!

363
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
So I see.

364
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,833
And now, a bath!

365
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
Are we going together
to the bathhouse?

366
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:47,866
Yeah, Chi; that's right.

367
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,766
Okay, I'm gonna teach you
how to take a bath right now.

368
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,733
Chi.

369
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,566
But, before we do that...

370
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:03,933
There that'll do it.

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,166
Alright, so the
first thing you'll do...

372
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,000
is to enter the
locker room, like this.

373
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:10,900
Locker room?

374
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,400
That's right: when you
enter the bathhouse,

375
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,966
the first room you go
into is the locker room.

376
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,833
And once you're there,

377
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,666
you take off your
clothes like this.

378
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,933
Chi

379
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,566
Ah-h-h-h-h-

380
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,966
No, you don't have
to do it right now!

381
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,166
Right.

382
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,833
Now to explain the bath
and how to use the tub.

383
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,966
The tub?

384
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,966
The bathtub's sorta
like a swimming pool.

385
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,366
It's a great big tub
filled with lotsa hot water

386
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,833
and it feels really good
when you get inside it.

387
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,766
Chi understands!

388
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,033
Huh?

389
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,700
The bath in Hideki's magazine!

390
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,366
Chi saw this before!

391
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:45,133
No!

392
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,100
Do you think you know
how to take a bath now?

393
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,333
Chi.

394
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,833
Don't forget: you have
to wash your body

395
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,966
with soap before
entering the bath.

396
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:54,900
Chi.

397
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,100
And if there's
something you don't know,

398
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,300
just look at the
people around you

399
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,600
and copy what they're doing!

400
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,600
Got that?

401
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,700
Chi.

402
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,566
Okay, see you later.

403
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,433
I wonder if Chi is all right.

404
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,300
But then again,

405
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:14,200
I think I've pretty much
taught her everything I can.

406
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:15,800
And anyway, things
like this always seem

407
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,366
to go a bit smoother
than you think

408
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,533
when you actually
get down to doing them.

409
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,033
Yeah! It's gonna be fine.

410
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
It's gonna be just fine.

411
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,533
Sir.

412
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,900
Excuse me, sir!

413
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:26,833
Hmm?

414
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,333
Over there.

415
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,566
Huh?

416
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,966
Chi, what on earth are you
doing in the men's locker room?

417
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:46,066
Hideki said Chi should watch
other people and copy them.

418
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,600
Huh?

419
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,466
Chi watched Hideki
and copied Hideki.

420
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,400
Hideki walked in here,
so Chi walked in here.

421
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,333
No, that's not it;
you can't follow me.

422
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,366
You hafta go into
the women's bath!

423
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:07,133
Chi, you go here!

424
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,300
Chi, together with Hideki.

425
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,833
Aww, geez, I don't know.

426
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,400
What am I supposed to do now?

427
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,733
Oh?

428
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,500
Oh, Miss Manager, hello.

429
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,666
That's good, and then
we'll wash this end.

430
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:33,966
Chi.

431
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:38,166
Wow, what a lucky break
to have her come by.

432
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,466
For a moment there,
I thought I was sunk.

433
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,000
Miss Landlord is
bigger here than Chi.

434
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,200
Huh?

435
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,400
Just like Hideki's magazine.

436
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,633
Oh... Oh, my...

437
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,666
I'm very sorry about all this.

438
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,133
And thank you for helping me
take care of Chi all the time.

439
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,433
Oh, that's all right.

440
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,700
And please feel
free to let me know

441
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,000
when you need to take
Chi to the bathhouse again.

442
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,933
Oh sure; thank you very much!

443
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,200
There we go, all done.

444
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,933
Doesn't she look nice?

445
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,700
There is nothing like a summer
kimono right after a bath!

446
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,533
Isn't it a nice feeling, Chi?

447
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,466
Hideki!

448
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,300
Huh?

449
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,866
Hideki is smiling!

450
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,366
Uh...

451
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,166
Wow, what a day.

452
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,000
At least the whole
bath thing worked out okay;

453
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,533
I'm glad that's over with.

454
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,500
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

455
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:49,300
I borrowed this from
Minoru when I saw him today.

456
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,333
Uh, hey...

457
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,433
This photo, is this
a picture of you, Chi?

458
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,100
No. This is not Chi.

459
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,466
All right!

460
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,566
Then it really was
just a prank after all!

461
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,466
Oh, I'm so glad.

462
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
I really am relieved.

463
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,066
There was no
need to worry at all.

464
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,366
That's right, Chi is...

465
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,033
Chi is Chi, and that's that!

466
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,433
Hey, look at that: there's
something else in here.

467
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:51,733
Oh...

468
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,333
It looks like a continuation
of that other book.

469
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,500
Very mysterious...

470
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,100
just like the first one.

471
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,133
That's right.
Chi bought that too.

472
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,533
Together with Hideki's new book.

473
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,833
Chi also wanted that one.

474
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,666
Well, I'm glad you got it.

475
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:11,366
It's your money; and you
earned it by working, Chi.

476
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,900
And you should use it to buy

477
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,166
whatever it is you
want from now on.

478
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,466
Chi.

479
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,533
Imagine you go out
on a date, Chi.

480
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,366
Bathhouse.

481
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:02,500
That's bad!

482
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,900
You don't want to go someplace

483
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,566
where you're separated
at the beginning.

484
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:06,633
On a date you want to go

485
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,833
where you can stay
together as long as possible!

486
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,966
Bookstore?

487
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,133
That's even worse!

488
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,800
You have to be so quiet there!

489
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:15,066
The real key to a date
is the conversation!

490
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,866
The more you talk,
the better the mood becomes!

491
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,433
Chi.

492
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,066
Well, at least that's
what the guidebook said.

493
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,533
Next episode of Chobits:

494
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,866

495
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:26,900
Studying and dating both
require serious research!

496
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,000
Chi!
