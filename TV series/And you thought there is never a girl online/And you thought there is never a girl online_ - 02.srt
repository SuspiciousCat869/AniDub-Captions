[AKO chuckles]

00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,958
[AKO]
I can hardly believe it.

3
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,958
Our Master's the student
council president!

4
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,291
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,291
As I recall, the student
council president's father

6
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,750
is an important figure
at the school.

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,791
That's right. He's a
member of the board.

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,375
For real? Your folks
must be loaded.

9
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,791
No, I wouldn't say that.

10
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,166
At most, we only own a couple
companies and private academies.

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,000
That only makes
me more envious.

12
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,791
It all makes sense now.

13
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,958
You spend so much
on Premium crap

14
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,208
'cause you've got your wealthy
parents to foot the bill.

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,750
Not quite.

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,291
The cash I spend in-game is
all money I earned for myself.

17
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,916
My parents loaned
the seed money,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,958
and I've already reimbursed
what they were owed.

19
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,583
[AKO] Ugh. People born with
silver spoons in their mouths

20
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,875
are the absolute worst.

21
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,708
They can all die screaming.

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,833
[HIDEKI, KYOH, AKANE]
Uh...

23
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,458
[laughing]

24
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,541
[HIDEKI]
Whoa, take it easy, Ako!

25
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,625
Sorry. I lost my head.

26
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,208
Don't worry, I feel
the same way...

27
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,875
In a less extreme version.

28
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,500
[KYOH chuckles]

29
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,958
[HIDEKI]
Whoa...

30
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,708
[KYOH] Things are
pretty strict at home.

31
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,291
My parents even control
who I socialize with,

32
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,958
but somehow, I managed
to convince them

33
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:39,333
to let me play multiplayer
games online.

34
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,625
And as a result, I came to know
all of you through the game

35
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,583
but I was missing one thing:

36
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,416
Real-life friends.

37
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,541
Noble Master!

38
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,125
The bards shall sing the tale of
our stand against the normies!

39
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,583
Ako! It's as if
you know my heart!

40
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,208
So this is what happens
when social rejects unite.

41
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,291
PVP isn't something to

42
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,541
emotionally clasp
your hands over!

43
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,000
[AKANE
Look, I'm telling you.

44
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,708
The most important factor is
having a powerful weapon.

45
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,916
Wasting time buffing your armor
is totally inefficient.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,083
Wrong. Armor is
the most important.

47
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,000
The skill hurdles for choosing
your preferred armor

48
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,000
are much higher than
they are for weapons.

49
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,833
It makes more sense to
upgrade your firepower

50
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,375
and grind high-level instances!

51
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,291
And how many times has that
gotten the whole party wiped,

52
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,333
Little Miss "Bad Mamma-Jamma"?

53
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,041
Ah! You can't call me that
in public, you big nerd!

54
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,250
I will call you that in public
'cause you're a nerd!

55
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,625
[Okay, hold on a sec.

56
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,375
There has to be a simpler,
more elegant way

57
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,708
to approach this situation.

58
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,333
[BOTH] You stay outta this,
Wallet Warrior!

59
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,500
Such a disrespectful tone to
take with your Guild Master.

60
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,541
Know what?

61
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,916
If I were to use
real money in-game,

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,541
I'd spend it on my appearance.

63
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,875
And then I can just sit back,

64
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,833
and leave all the killing
to the rest of you guys.

65
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,541
Yeah? Deal's off. Screw you.

66
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,291
[AKANE]
You wanna swallow an eye?

67
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,916
She's our healer, remember?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,416
Spending cash on defensive
gear would be the right move.

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,125
Which could end up pretty
useful, since our tank

70
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,458
keeps pulling aggro faster
than I can heal him.

71
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,833
That's funny, 'cause this tank
never ran into any problems

72
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,250
when he was playing solo.

73
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,583
Or it could be our healer
totally sucks at her job,

74
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,333
and so I have to boost my armor.

75
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,708
There's no rebuttal
for that argument.

76
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,708
True. No need to
debate that further.

77
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,041
No! I'm not listening!

78
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,041
[HIDEKI, AKANE, KYOH laugh]

79
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,416
[HIDEKI]
So, uh, hey. I'm sorry.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,583
[AKO] What are you
saying you're sorry for?

81
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,791
[HIDEKI] Well, you know,
to tell you the truth...

82
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,500
I thought you'd all be dudes.

83
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,916
Okay. Is that all?

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,208
I already told you online
that I was a high school girl

85
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,250
in real life, but I guess
seeing is believing, isn't it?

86
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,625
And just so you know,

87
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,000
you made one helluva stupid
face when we showed up!

88
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,541
Just so you know,
it was because of you.

89
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,916
Anyway, I always assumed
games and reality

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,250
were two separate things,

91
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,750
but I enjoyed meeting
you in real life

92
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,291
as much as in the game.

93
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,916
I just feel very fortunate that
the people I pal around with

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,125
in <i>LA</i> are cool in
the real world too.

95
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,833
You gonna start misting up now?

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,083
[HIDEKI]
That was mean!

97
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,541
[AKANE]
My reactions are the same.

98
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,666
It doesn't matter if it's in
the game or in real life.

99
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,875
[KYOH chuckles]

100
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,375
[KYOH] Yeah. I'm in
no position to tease.

101
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,458
Part of me was afraid that
Rusian was gonna be a weird,

102
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,708
smelly guy that spent the whole
time ogling, so we're even.

103
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,750
One thing.

Never try to act all buddy-buddy
with me while we're at school.

No need to get
jealous, silly girl.

I promise I'm not trying to
steal your husband away.

112
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,125
I'd never want him.

113
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,125

00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah.

116
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,875
[AKO] So, Rusian, you really
thought that I was a guy

117
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,291
playing the game as a girl?

118
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,708
[HIDEKI]
I did.

119
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,458
In all honesty, I thought you
might be an older man.

[Why'd you think that?

121

I know I told you I was
a girl a long time ago,

122
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,125
but I guess my word
isn't good enough.

123
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,500
Hey, I'm sorry.

124
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,041
It's okay, but still, if
you actually thought that,

125
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,750
why'd you agree to marry me?

126
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,375
Well, I guess... your
gender didn't matter.

[AKO whines]

128

No, I didn't mean it like that!

129
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,041
The game and reality are
completely different things!

130
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:44,041
Real life didn't matter.
Ako in the game is who I liked.

131
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,500
In the end, I said "Why not?"

132
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,791
[AKO] So um, I think I
get what you're saying.

133
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,166
Age, looks, gender,
none of that mattered.

We just got along, and you
started to like me for me.

00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,958
but then this happens.

161
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,041
Your healing can be a little
on the slow side...

162
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,666
...but it doesn't affect
me that much.

163
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,875
Well, sometimes you end
up spinning your wheels...

164
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,833
...but don't worry
about it, Ako!

165
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,750
[RUSIAN]
Yeah! Don't worry about it!

166
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,875
Even though I just lost
a buttload of XP

167
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,083
in death penalties due to
your constant screw ups.

168
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,250
I'm so sorry, Rusian!

169
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,375
[AKANE, KYOH laugh]

170
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,833
[chuckles]

171
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,791
There's no need for that.
I'm just kidding!

172
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,500
[KYOH] All right,
guess it's just about time

173
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,000
that I logged off.

174
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
I have business to attend
to in the morning.

175
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,000
[RUSIAN]
Up at school?

176
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,250
[KYOH]
That's right.

177
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,958
Being president is usually
a pretty easy job,

178
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,958
but there are times where
it gets kinda busy.

179
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,291
Oh, and you can all feel
free to call me "Master"

180
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,458
if we ever bump into each other
while we're at school.

181
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,500
Please, as if!

182
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,166
Hey, Schew?
You're outta character.

183
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,291
Oh. Word.

184
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,708
[AKO]
Well, I'm off too.

185
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,666
I'm going to take a bath,
then bedtime!

186
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,083
A bath?

187
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,458
[SCHWEIN] What're ya
thinkin' about, tough guy?

188
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,041
Oh! Nothing!
Nothing at all! I wasn't!

189
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
[AKO chuckles]

190
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,833
See you later!

191
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,291
Go on. Have a soak in the tub,
and wash that sweat off.

192
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,791
[RUSIAN]
As if she's worked up a sweat.

193
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,625
[SCHWEIN]
Huh?

194
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,791
Neither did you

195
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,791
'cause pigs don't sweat,
Swordsman Schwein!

196
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,500
Stop calling me...

197
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,250
[squealing]

198
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,291
...a pig, you mega-nerd!

199
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,750
You can be a real pain
in the butt, dorkballs!

200
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,833
[RUSIAN] And yet here you are,
hanging out with me.

201
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,333
Now that you know
my secret identity,

202
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,750
this banter's a lot
harder to do.

203
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,083
[RUSIAN] Is that not
something pigs excel at?

204
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,875
Listen.

205
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,000
If you ever try to pal
around with me at school,

206
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,083
I'll cut you till you
squeal like a pig.

207
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,750
[RUSIAN]
Okay, I hear you!

208
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,875
I'll keep my mouth shut,

209
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,083
and I won't act
differently towards you.

210
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,708
Do you really mean it?

211
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,416
You swear you'll keep quiet?

212
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,833
The game and reality
are separate,

213
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,250
as far as I see things.

214
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,291
Also, I don't think
it's a good idea

215
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,458
if you get too familiar
with Ako, either.

216
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,583
It would be bad if any
funny rumors got started.

217
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,958
Yeah, I get it.

218
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,791
[SCHWEIN] Well, this bad
mamma-jamma's loggin' off.

219
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,708
[RUSIAN] Could you pick a
character and stick with it?

220
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,583
[AKANE]
Oh, shut up, geek!

221
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,500
Uh. Hi there. Morning.

222
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,708
Yeah. Morning.

223
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,625
Uh! Wait, what gave you the idea

224
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,416
that you could talk to
me all of a sudden?

225
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,125
Whoa, aren't you being
kind of irrational?

226
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,250
It's nice to see you
guys getting along!

227
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,916
How could you think I'd get
along with someone so gross?

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,083
Okay, I'm sorry,
Segawa. My bad.

229
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,708
[NANAKO]
Wait up, Akane!

230
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,250
Did you crash and burn too?

231
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,916
It's more complicated than that.

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,166
Yeah, why would you care
about real life anyway?

233
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,708
You're perfectly happy with
your online, 2D waifu.

234
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
[HIDEKI grumbles]

235
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,666
Yeah, well, my online
wife is surprisingly cute,

236
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,791
I'll have you know, and she's--

237
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,458
[AKO]
There you are, Rusian!

238
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,625
Hi Rusian!

239
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,083
What's a Rusian?

240
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,916
[HIDEKI]
No idea.

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,875
Dude, she's coming over.

242
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,041
Good morning, Rusian!

243
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,125
[TAKAZAKI]
Nishimura. You know her?

244
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,541
Uh. No?

245
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,583
My class is just down
the hall, Rusian!

246
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,000
[TAKAZAKI]
Uh... Rusian? 'Zat you?

247
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,083
[HIDEKI]
What? No.

248
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,166
Is something bothering
you, Rusian?

249
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,750
I hope you're not coming
down with some kinda bug.

250
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,041
Are you all right,
Rusian? Rusian?

251
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,125
[HIDEKI growls]

252
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,875
[HIDEKI]
Rusian this, and Rusian that!

253
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,791
Stop saying that name!

254
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,791
Why won't you just tell
me what you want?!

255
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,208
I wish we had gotten to be
together even longer last night.

256

[HIDEKI yelps]

257
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,333
Whoa, Ako. What are
you talking about?

258
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,583
[AKO] Please, don't make
me say it, Rusian...

259
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,041
This isn't what
it sounds like!

260
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,458
She doesn't mean it that
way, really! I swear!

261
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,875
Sure, all right.

262
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,791
So what kinda relationship
do you have with her?

263
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,458
Wait! Don't answer that!

264
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,041
[AKO]
Oh, Rusian?

265
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,958
He means the world to me
'cause he's my husband!

266
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,041
[HIDEKI screams]

267
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,958
[AKANE]
Excuse me... Miss Tamaki?

268
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,875
I don't know what all this
Rusian stuff is about,

269
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,708
but if it's otaku-related,
could you take it outside?

270
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,250
She's right. We should take
this conversation elsewhere.

271
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,666
Schew! Hiya!

272
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,541

00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,166
[HIDEKI yelps]

274
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,291
[STUDENTS gasp]

275
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,833
Wow, I envy you, Schew.

276
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,208
You get to be in the same
class as my Rusian! Lucky.

277
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,125
No, I, uh...

278
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,875
Yes, Schew?

279
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,958
[AKANE] I still don't know
what you're talking about,

280
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,958
but perhaps we should
take it outside.

281
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,166
What? You know, the game.

282
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,750
[AKANE] Listen. I'm saying,
let's step outside. Understand?

283
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,375
[AKO] Huh? Is something
upsetting you, Schew?

284
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,125
I didn't call you
by your full name!

285
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,375
Live long and prosper,
or get rekt, Schwein.

286
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,708
Shouldn't you be saying
something like

287
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,708
"I'm a bad mamma-jamma"
right about now?

288
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,666
[AKANE]
No!

289
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,625
Calm down, Shew!
I mean Segawa!

290
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,083
You keep your trap shut too!

291
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,041
What's this? Do the three
of you know each other?

292
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,333
No!

293
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,875
Now will you just come
outside with me?

294
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,916
Okay, Schew.

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,291
[AKANE]
Stop calling me that!

296
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,416
[AKO]
Okay, Schwein!

297
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,250
[AKANE]
That's not what I meant!

298
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,375
[AKO]
Wait, did I do something wrong?

299
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,458
"Did I do something wrong?"
she asks me.

300
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,791
Only everything!

301
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,791
But... I'm confused.
How have I upset you, Schew?

302
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,250
It's because you keep
referring to Akane as "Schew."

303
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,125
I shouldn't?

304
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,916
No, you definitely shouldn't!

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,458
Listen, Ako.

306
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,416
"Rusian" and "Schwein" are only
the names of our characters

307
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,208
in the game, you understand?

308
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,000
Consider the TPO next time.

309
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,208
[AKO] Uh... But the only way
I really know you guys

310
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,208
is as Rusain and Schew.

311
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,500
[AKANE] We aren't playing
the game right now, are we?

312
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,750
[HIDEKI] The game and reality
are separate, all right?

313
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,333
Why would they be?

314
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
[BOTH gasp]

315

00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,166
[AKANE] I'm not even sure
what you're asking.

317
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,250
[AKO]
Did I say something strange?

318
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,625
I-I apologize, Schew. I assumed
you and I were friends.

319
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,541
We've played together
long enough.

320
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,833
I thought chatting everyday
meant you liked me.

321
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,791
No. I didn't mean that!

322
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,208
Ako, it isn't--

323
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,625
Are you and I nothing more
than strangers, Rusian?

324
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,083
I mean nothing to you?

325
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,750
But I still love you, Rusian.

326
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,583
Were you lying when you
said you loved me back?

327
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,833
You even married me!

328
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,791
So?

329
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,166
Hey, she's your wife, right?
You've gotta fix this.

330
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,000
Let's just play along
with her for now.

331
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,958
Okay.

332
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,458
[AKANE laughs]

333
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,500
What a laugh! Ako, you're an
important part of our guild.

334
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,750
--Right, friend?
--Oh! Yeah!

335
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,000
[AKO]
That's not true!

336
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,875
Now you're just setting
me up to be mean to me!

337
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,916
It's a mind game! You're trying
to destroy me from the inside!

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,708
[AKANE]
No, we aren't.

339
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,875
You mean it?

340
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,458
Yeah. We were just
pulling your chain, Ako.

341
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,541
As far as things in <i>Legendary</i>
<i>Age</i> are concerned,

342
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,208
you're still my lovely wife.

343
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,416
We're still friends.

344
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,125
We just want you to stop
using our game names

345
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,250
in real life, okay?

346
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,375
Pig nailed it.

347
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,541
Shut your face, string bean!

348
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,083
We're talkin' about
my school rep!

349
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,000
I work hard not to come
across as an otaku,

350
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,250
but online gaming seals it.

351
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,750
So what... what
should I call you?

352
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,791
You can call me Segawa,
or even Akane if you want.

353
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,208
[AKO]
Oh? S-Segawa. Right.

354
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,166
Yes! Thanks, Tamaki.

355
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,416
So then... are you still
one of my friends?

356
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,166
I said so, didn't I?

357
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,666
That's a relief.

358
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,208
Since we're ironing
everything out,

359
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,083
you can call me Nishimura.

360
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, Nishimura, huh?

361
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,541
That's right, Ako.

362
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,041
Uh, I mean Tamaki.

363
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,375
You can call me Ako.

364
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,833
Wait, are you sure?

365
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,375
Yes! Please! I like
to hear you say it!

366
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,833
I dunno. It all seems too
familiar for school grounds.

367
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,708
Fine! Then I guess I'll just
keep calling you Rusian!

368
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,333
[HIDEKI]
I beg your pardon, Miss Ako!

369
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,583
[giggles]

370
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,750
Or you could
call me Mrs. Rusian!

371
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,458
It's Nishimura, actually.

372
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,291
Pushover.

373
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,875
Quiet you!

374
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,000
Could I ask you
a question, Schew?

375
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,416
I mean, Segawa.

376
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,458
It's still okay to talk to
you here at school, right?

377
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,458
Sure, but nothing about
net games, got it?

378
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,083
Oh, I can't do that.

379
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,500
Whaddya mean?

380
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,041
It's just, there's nothing
else for me to talk about.

381
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,541
That sounds
heart-breakingly sad.

382
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,791
Well, we can
always talk about

383
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,958
whatever you want when
we're out questing.

384
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,208
Just make your husband pick up
the slack in the meantime.

385
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,666
Is that okay with you, Rusian?

386
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,166
I really wish you'd
pump the brakes

387
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,333
with this whole "Rusian"
and husband business.

388
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,583
But other than that, fine.

389
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,041
[AKO gasps]

390
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,000
[AKO] Dearest Rusian,
you really are on my side!

391
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,541
Did you hear a word I just said?

392
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,916
[SAITO]
Hey, there!

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,333
Homeroom's about to get started,
so let's get moving!

394
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,541
[AKANE sighs]

395
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,666
It's morning, and
I'm already drained.

396
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,250
Guess what, Rusian!

397
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,208
I made a bento box for you, so
we can eat our lunch together!

398
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,166
What? Why would you do
something like that?

399
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,166
Oh, please. You are
my husband, Rusian!

400
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,291
It's my pleasure!

401
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,958
Yeah, but remember what
we talked about?

402
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,750
That's just in the game.

403
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,666
Yep! We got married, didn't we?

404
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,041
Nishimura, I think I've
just figured something out.

405
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,458
Yeah. We might be
on the same page.

406
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,958
I'm starting to think
that Ako can't differentiate

407
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,291
between the game and reality.

408
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,875
[KYOH]
Yes, I see. That's hilarious!

409
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,125
[HIDEKI]
No it isn't!

410
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,625
[AKANE] The stress
shaved years off my life!

411
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,916
I'm so sorry.

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No, you don't have to
apologize for anything.

413
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,250
She even packed a little
lunch box for him.

414
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,375
[KYOH]
Hmm...

415
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,833
As far as Ako's concerned,

416
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,125
she and Rusian have been
married for a while.

417
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,291
It's only natural to make lunch
for your beloved husband.

418
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,583
Is that unusual?

419
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,125
[KYOH]
Well, it's true you and Rusian

420
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,125
have known each other a long
time, enough to fall in love,

421
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,875
and at last you were married.

422
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,500
However, that only
happened within the game.

423
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,541
I doubt you've found
real love with a person

424
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,375
whose face and name
you never knew.

425
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,500
But that isn't true!
It's because he was unknown.

426
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,958
When I was chatting with Rusian,

427
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,875
I started to care for him
because it felt like

428
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,791
his heart was
in the right place.

429
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,125
Our love is one of purity
and tenderness.

430
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,791
You can't change that!
And it burns you normies up!

431
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,583
Y'know, when you
put it that way...

432
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,500
[HIDEKI] C'mon, Master.
Stand your ground!

433
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,416
[KYOH] Isn't there a part of
you that wants to believe

434
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,875
what she's been saying?

435
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,958
In my opinion, Ako genuinely
likes you for who you are.

436
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,583
But isn't that really
all just jumbled up

437
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,833
with the appearance and
stats of my character?

438
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,083
Not to mention I always take
care of her in dungeons,

439
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,083
so naturally that's going
to affect how she thinks.

440
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
[AKO]
That isn't it at all.

441
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,500
I've played the game with
other people before, Rusian,

442
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,666
not just you.

443
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,250
And they all left me behind.

444
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,833
But you stuck with
me the whole way.

445
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,333
Didn't matter how many
times I goofed up,

446
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,416
how many times I forgot,
you name it.

447
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,083
That's why...
I fell in love with you.

448
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,041
[AKANE] Yeah, okay, sounds
great. Best wishes and all.

449
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
I'm out before I puke.

450
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,583
Wait, Segawa don't! If you
leave now, it won't be pretty.

451
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,666
Blow it out your ears,
stinking hook-up troll!

452
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,583
[HIDEKI] Hook-up troll?
Is that what you think I am?

453
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,916
You're wrong! Completely wrong!

454
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,333
Doesn't look that
way from here!

455
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,291
What's a hook-up troll, Master?

456
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,500
A netizen who tries to
teach naïve girls about men.

457
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
[HIDEKI]
Okay, fine!

458
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,583
So be it. Let's do this, Ako.

459
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,958
[AKO]
What are we going to do?

460
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,166
Time to change your mentality!

461
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,750
It needs to be changed?

462
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,333
It does! The game and
reality are separate!

463
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,500
It's our job to make sure
you understand that!

464
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,875
Why would you do
something so terrifying?

465
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,750
It sounds positively fiendish!

466
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,333
Easier said than done,
right, big shot?

467
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,041
[HIDEKI]
Let me think.

468
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,250
We just have to get across

469
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,083
that Rusian in the game
and me in real life

470
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,958
are two completely
different things.

471
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,000
Huh...

472
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,583
We need to find
a way to illustrate

473
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,625
that the game is not reality.

474
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,708
[HIDEKI]
What are you thinking, Master?

475
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,583
[KYOH] Yes, just leave
everything to me.

476
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,625
[HIDEKI]
"Modern Communication..."

477
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,666
[AKO]
"...Electronic Game Club"?

478
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,791
Sounds like a club
for online gaming.

479
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
[KYOH]
Hey, you guys!

480
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,625
Sorry to keep you waiting.

481
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,125
I got bogged down filling
out application forms.

482
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,416
[AKANE]
Applications?

483
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,625
[KYOH chuckles]

484
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,958
[KYOH] Take a peek,
and you'll understand.

485
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,916
Feast your eyes! The Mod
Comm Electronic Game Club!

486
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,375
Umm... Too long.

487
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,250
Welcome to the Net Game Club!

488
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,166
I am the founder of the group...

489
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,875
...President Goshoin.

490
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,375
Fellow club members!

491
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,583
What say we put these new
computers through their paces,

492
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,250
and get the fun started?

493
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,416
--A Net Game Club?
--Members?

494
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,041
Our club's activities
will consist of

495
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,000
after-school <i>Legendary</i>
<i>Age</i> sessions.

496
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,750
And partying on days off.

497
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,375
No way. This has to be a joke.

498
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,416
In what way?

499
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,791
What do you mean,
"In what way?"

500
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,208
We talked about things at lunch,

501
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,333
and now there's computers
and a club enrollment?

502
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,125
If this is a joke,
I don't get it.

503
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,375
Well, Ako?

504
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,833
Huh? I was just admiring
the fine work she did.

505
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,750
Which I don't see
as a laughing matter.

506
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,958
And that's what I get
for asking your opinion.

507
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,208
That's mean!

508
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,041
So you're telling me you
formed a Net Game Club

509
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,416
to play a game we all
play at home already.

510
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,750
We'll be together!

511
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,416
Yes! Isn't it grand?

512
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,958
How utterly amazing...

513
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,333
Well, I'll just be going then.

514
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,958
Hold, Schwein. What's wrong?

515
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,791
Don't call me that!

516
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,083
Now look, I'm fine playing
the occasional net game

517
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,083
as a fun distraction, but this?

518
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,583
[KYOH]
Huh.

519
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,083
Weren't you the one who said
she didn't want a boyfriend

520
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,208
because it would cut
into her login time?

521
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,458
[AKANE groans]

522
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,125
If you extended your
play-time by two hours,

523
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,875
just think of how much more
you could earn in a day.

524
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,250
I can play the game at home.

525
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,666
I just wanted a normal high
school girl's life here.

526
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,833
It won't be long till we've
completely out-leveled you,

527
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,500
moved onto newer
grinding pastures,

528
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,291
and poor Schwein
will be left behind.

529
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,750
Which would truly be a shame.

530
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,708
Your words can't
faze me, all right?

531
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,208
[HIDEKI]
Whoa, check out this rig!

532
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,375
These specs are stupid high!

533
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,291
Between the graphics
processor and the RAM,

534
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,791
this computer could eat any
net game for breakfast!

535
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,916
[KYOH chuckles]

536
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
That reminds me, Schwein.

537
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,833
Didn't you once say your PC was
an underpowered pile of crap?

538
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,708
It's true! Dumb hand-me-down!

539
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,833
You're free to play on
these uber-powerful rigs,

540
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,250
if you're interested.

541
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,291
Ugh! As appealing as that is,
it just isn't enough.

542
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,916
That's brutal!
Master likes to fight dirty!

543
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,166
Time to give up, Schwein.

544
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,041
[AKANE] All right! Fine!
I'm in already, let it go!

545
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,416
But in return,

546
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
I get to do whatever I like
with this pretty lady.

547
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,500
[KYOH]
Very well.

548
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,875
We can now meet as the Net
Game Club for the first time.

549
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,833
But, Master, why even
go through the trouble

550
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,208
of forming a new club?

551
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,041
What, you don't know?
For you and Ako, of course.

552
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,041
For us?

553
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:09,916
Huh?

554
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,250
We have to demonstrate to Ako

555
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,250
the difference between
the game and real life.

556
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,666
That is what you said.

557
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,583
Yeah, I did.

558
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,083
[KYOH] The characters
we play in the game

559
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,333
and the people in here
exist simultaneously.

560
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,958
If we plan to show
Ako the difference

561
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,083
between <i>LA</i> and real life,
isn't this the best way?

562
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,083
I get it!

563
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,583
Umm...

564
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,833
I don't think this is gonna
change anything.

565
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:30,625
It will!

566
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,208
I'm a pathetic jerk, Ako,

567
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,208
and I'll make sure to shatter
your illusion of me into pieces!

568
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,416
There must be a way to say that

569
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,625
that doesn't come
off so aggressive.

570
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,166
Wrong, darling!

571
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,958
I'll prove that my love for you
runs as deep and powerfully

572
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,083
as the crashing seas!

573
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,208
I'd expect no less.

574
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,291
I am a total loser, B.T. dubs.

575
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,375
[AKO]
Oh, be quiet, silly.

576
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,250
[RUSIAN] I guess the others
still haven't logged in yet.

577
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:57,208
[NEKOHIME]
No way! Rusian?

578
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,666
Long time nyao see!
Hey there!

579
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,041
[AKANE] Nishimura's sorrow
makes my food taste sweeter,

580
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,625
and a wimp like him
is always miserable.

581
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,166
[HIDEKI]
Are you trolling me, oinkster?

582
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,250
[AKANE] Cut it with the pig
jokes before I fry your bacon!

583
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,958
[HIDEKI]
Now you're doing it!
