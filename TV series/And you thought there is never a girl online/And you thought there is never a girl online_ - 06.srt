This was right after my proposal

Sarasara, my wife,

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,166
one of her alt toons just got
married to some other man!

It's okay if it's a
different character, right?

No, it isn't!
She's cheating on me!

8
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,916
She probably just
married her alt off

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,833
for the spousal stat bonus.

Some players take the
in-game marriage mechanics

But not me!

I actually fell in
love with her, man!

14

[YUYUN] I refuse to be
alone in my suffering!

"I am a man, and have no desire
to meow-rry another man."

Soul-crushing. Why did
I ask her to marry me?

That was quick.

00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,000
This bad mamma-jamma's
more direct.

163
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,916
[giggles] Mamma-jamma.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
[AKANE]
Would you drop it already?

165
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,625
Hey, I'm sorry! You just never
talk like that in real life.

166
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,208
You've been playing the game
a couple weeks now, right?

167
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,375
Time to let it go.

168
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,583
Yeah, I guess you're right.

169
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,708
[groans] So let me ask you this.

170
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,500
Have you even bothered to look
at the strategy page I sent you?

171
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,041
I read it, but
didn't understand.

172
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,583
Whenever I don't understand
something, Nishimura...

173
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,041
...I mean, Rusian, is the
one I go to for advice.

174
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,166
Yeah, and take a long
look at the results!

175
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,041
You hit the wrong button
to disarm the trap,

176
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,833
and blew us all up!

177
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,500
You attacked that boss monster
when our healer was out of mana,

178
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,833
and caused a party wipe!

179
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,416
My bad.

180
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
[AKANE] You paying attention,
Ako? It's just like real life!

181
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,500
This is the result of ignorance!

182
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,875
[AKO]
I understand, Schew!

183
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,500
I'll do anything in my power
to not end up like that!

184
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,875
That isn't the nicest way
to talk to our new friend.

185
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,125
[KYOH chuckles]

186
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,416
I can't believe you
guys seem so relaxed.

187
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,833
About what?

188
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,666
[SETTE] You know. Final exams.
They're coming up soon.

189
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,125
[gasps]

190
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,458
[yelps]

191
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,666
I guess it is about
that time of year.

192
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,125
Uh-huh.

193
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,041
For the time being, our club
is on temporary hiatus.

194
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,041
The club room is off-limits
until testing is over.

195
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,500
That should give us all
a chance to study up.

196
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,916
How can you be so calm, Master?

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,708
I'm a good student,
and I excel at test-taking.

198
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,208
The worst part is that
it's totally true!

199
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,833
After we've finished
final exams,

200
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,916
it's off to summer vacation!

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,750
[giggles]

202
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,041
You planning something?

203
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,375
What, like an event?

204
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,916
[KYOH] Yes. Something
for us to look forward to!

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,875
Umm?

206
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,291
I know it's exam week,

207
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,916
but we're still free to log in
from home, aren't we?

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,666
I'll leave that entirely
to your discretion.

209
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,208
Besides, everybody needs the
occasional break from studying!

210
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,375
[AKO] If we're not having
any club meetings,

211
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,916
then I've lost one of my main
reasons for going to school.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Maybe I could just study
at home until the test?

213
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,416
No, you've gotta go!

214
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,666
If you miss any more days,
it might hurt your grade!

215
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,166
[AKO]
I guess you're right,

216
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,625
but I was only coming to school
for club meetings anyway.

217
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,416
There goes my motivation.

218
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,708
You won't be able to participate
in club activities if you flunk.

219
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,416
Push through to the other side.

220
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,291
This sucks.

221
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,041
I only go to school
to do club stuff,

222
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,833
and now I can't do club stuff
because of school?

223
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,125
How odd.

224
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,250
You can pass the
test if you try.

225
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,416
And I'll push you the whole way.

226
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah! Go team!

227
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,250
[AKO] You can push me like
this all the way home.

228
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,000
Stop leaning back,
your Royal Dorkness.

229
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,291
Still. It's almost
summer vacation time!

230
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,541
Summer vacation.

231
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,833
I've got a lot
to do before then.

232
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:47,125
Oh, no. What? We've got
tests to pass before then!

233
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,625
Tests. What? You are
ready for them, right?

234
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,125
[AKO humming]

235
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,541
Ako?

236
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,750
Personally? I dream of
being a homemaker.

237
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,125
So how did you do
on your midterms?

238
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,958
Like B's or C's? Or maybe D's?
They can't have all been F's.

239
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,541
[AKO whistles]

240
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,291
Seriously?

241
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,833
What to do?

242
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
If she gets stuck
doing summer school,

243
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,958
how am I supposed to
declare my love for her?

244
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,541
[MIZUKI]
What are you mumbling about?

245
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,375
[yelps]

246
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,916
[HIDEKI]
Oh, heya, Mizuki.

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,875
Hey yourself.

248
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,291
Are you doing anything?

249
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,250
I could use a
little help studying.

250
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,791
Studying?

251
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,916
She needs help with studying.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,625
That's it!

253
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,625
[MIZUKI]
Hold on! Is that a no?

254
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,500
Ugh...

255
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,541
[KYOH]
Excellent idea.

256
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,125
Glad to hear you agree.

257
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,708
[AKANE] That seems like it would
be the most effective option.

258
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,291
Come on, you guys, no way!

259
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,333
Why are you all
conspiring against me?

260
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,666
Rusian!

261
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,875
[RUSIAN]
Next question.

262
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,458
What is the name of the law

263
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,291
where the government allotted
farmland and levied taxes on it?

264
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,166
[AKO]
The Handen Shuju Law.

265
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,541
That's correct.

266
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,625
Make sure that you know
how to write that in kanji.

267
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,500
I've had enough of
Japanese history!

268
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,041
I've got kanji ricocheting
inside my head!

269
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,916
All right then,
we can move on to math,

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,625
and this bad mamma-jamma's
gonna tutor you.

271
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,000
But I hate math even more!

272
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,583
My Icicle Wall will make sure
you can't worm your way

273
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,083
out of this study session.

274
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,416
[AKO] This is cruel and unusual!
I wanted to play the game,

275
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,666
but here we are, wasting
our time with studying!

276
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,375
It's the only way we
could get you to do it.

277
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,916
What're you complaining for?

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,333
You've got all of your friends
here to help you with this.

279
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,708
We don't wanna lose you,

280
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,458
so we're going to make sure
you get passing grades.

281
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,750
Who really cares about
the first term anyway?

282
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,041
I'll just take a couple make-up
courses over the summer break.

283
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,750
[NEKOHIME]
No, you won't!

284
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,625
The teachers have their hands
full with entrance examinees.

285
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:08,250
They don't have time to give
make-up classes for freshmen.

286
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,375
If you don't like math,
work on Japanese.

287
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,291
Just a second, please.
You're a teacher in real life.

288
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,166
Doesn't that make this
a make-up class?

289
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,958
I'm not a teacher in the game.

290
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm just Nekohime!

291
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,583
Hey, Nishimura.

292
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,583
What is my name?

293
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,083
Sorry, Rusian.

294
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,375
What's all this about Nekohime
actually being a teacher?

295
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,458
That answer's not on
the test, so hey,

296
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,333
let's listen to what
she has to say.

297
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,666
[SETTE]
Okay!

298
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,708
When I look at all those
long, difficult sentences,

299
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,875
it makes my brain start to ache.

300
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,041
But essay writing is essential!

301
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,416
[AKO screams]

302
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,041
[RUSIAN]
Hang in there, Ako.

303
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,666
[SAITO]
All right. Begin.

304
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,000
Our test days are finally over.

305
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,916
Come on, Ako!
Pull yourself together!

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,916
I had Ako's answer
sheets graded first,

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,541
and it looks like she
passed every one of them!

308
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,916
No make-up classes or
anything? That's awesome!

309
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
[NEKOHIME] I'd say all our
effort has finally paid off!

310
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,791
[RUSIAN]
Isn't that great, Ako?

311
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,416
Sure is! Now let's
go do some grinding.

312
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,625
Hey, hold on! You still
seem a little woozy.

313
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,208
You need to catch
up on your sleep.

314
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,083
Aww.

315
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,166
I'm fine.

316
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,625
[KYOH]
And just because tests are over,

317
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,833
it doesn't mean you're allowed
to skip school again.

318
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,750
I understand.
I'll log off now.

319
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,125
Goodnight everyone. Sleep tight.

320
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,375
[RUSIAN]
Yeah, you too.

321
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,208
--Night!
--Goodnight!

322
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,833
[NEKOHIME] I have a stack
of papers to grade.

323
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:44,791
I'm out too.

324
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,125
--Bye!
--Night!

325
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,583
I can hear my bed
calling my name.

326
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,791
[AKANE]
Yeah, ditto.

327
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,958
Uh, could both of
you hang on a sec?

328
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:57,208
I, uh... need to ask your
advice about something.

329
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,625
[RUSIAN]
Yeah, so, uh...

330
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,291
I've decided to tell
Ako I love her,

331
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,208
so how should I do it?

332
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,208
Huh? Laggy?

333
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,250
I want to declare my love for
Ako. How do you think I should?

334
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,583
Don't ask us twice.
We heard you.

335
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,500
Then what was that ridiculously
long pause all about?

336
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,000
It's just so beyond too late,
we didn't know how to respond.

337
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,500
You moron!

338
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,708
You're too slow on the draw.
Your timing's all mixed up.

339
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,791
Uh, well, it's almost
summer vacation, you know.

340
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,625
We won't see each other
as much outside the game.

341
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,958
I see.

342
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,583
You want to create
lifelong memories

343
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,333
of youthful summer passion.

344
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,666
Yeah, I guess.

345
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,916
Sure thing, buddy.

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,291
You go right ahead and
try that out. Good luck.

347
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,541
Well said. This whole matter
is between you and Ako.

348
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,708
There's nothing we can say
that you don't already know.

349
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,791
How can you both be
so cold-hearted?

350
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,416
Like, what if she turns me down?

351
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,458
[AKANE]
So don't tell her you love her.

352
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,458
No, I have to.

353
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,000
You're being a total pain!

354
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,083
Indeed.

355
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,708
However, given
the circumstances,

356
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,666
I don't see her rejecting
your confession.

357
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,708
She's probably right,
and the sooner you do it,

358
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,291
the better your odds
are gonna be.

359
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,375
Ako's not the type to
shoot her husband down.

360
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,250
You mean it? You're not
just messing with me?

361
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,708
Yes, I mean it.

362
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,250
Yeah, all right,

363
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,791
but I shouldn't do something
this important over the phone.

364
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,208
This is new territory.

365
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,458
I've never really declared
my love to anybody before.

366
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,375
You're both real life girls,
what should I do?

367
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,916
Yes, that's a good question.

368
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,750
[RUSIAN] Surely, you've been
popular with the boys.

369
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,041
Quite the opposite.

370
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,166
I've actually never had
a boyfriend before.

371
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,833
So thanks for bringing that up.

372
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,833
Yikes. And you Schew?

373
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,750
Guys have declared their
love for you, right?

374
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,875
And I've turned them all down.

375
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,791
So talk to me if you need
advice on getting rejected.

376
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm good, but thanks.

377
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,333
[KYOH]
Let's be honest.

378
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,666
We're all still too young
to have any real history

379
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,666
or experience with romance.

380
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,291
But we can still help.

381
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,833
We'll think of ways
to declare your love

382
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,958
that would leave any
girl speechless.

383
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,791
Yes! That's perfect!

384
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,583
And throughout your summer,

385
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,541
I hope you will all
remember to uphold

386
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,333
the proud standards
of Maegasaki Academy.

387
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,791
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,250
I hope you have a safe
and productive summer!

It's time for our
last club meeting!

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,958
Oh. Yeah.

00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,375
See ya later, Ako.

With a beautiful
face like yours,

398
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,625
I might actually miss
comin' to school.

399
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,333
We should hang.

400
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,833
Sorry, who are you?

May his soul find peace.

404
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,416
The final club meeting for
the first term begins.

405
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,958
We won't be doing
anything special.

406
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,958
Guild Alleycats will
continue operating,

407
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,625
but there will be no club
meetings during our vacation.

408

This summer, let's be sure
to enjoy our net games

in moderation!

--Yeah!
--Fine, fine.

[chuckles]

413
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,458
This weekend, the Net Game Club
will be holding a club camp!

414
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,708
Wow, that's so soon.

415
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,333
I can hardly wait!

416
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,458
A freaking Net Game Club Camp?

417
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,375
One thing is needed to excel.

418
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,500
Well, two.
Cash for premium items.

419
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,125
But the player's physical
fitness is most important!

420
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,000
Thus, life at this camp will be
primarily spent outdoors.

421
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,625
Brace yourselves for training!

422
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,666
[SAITO]
Mh-hm.

423
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,833
That's just what
kids your age need!

424
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,416
Naturally, I will be
accompanying you.

425
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,166
Looks like some beach time
is on the schedule too!

426
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,708
Ah! I guess we're
gonna need our swimsuits!

427
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah. I guess so.

428
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,458
If you follow this advice,

00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,333
then it's bound to
go smooth as satin.

I wish you good fortune.

00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,208
Rusian, what kind of
swimsuits do you like?

432
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,125
I assume you're into
the school one pieces.

433
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,666
What do you mean you assume?

434
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,541
I don't think I've ever
said anything like that.

435
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,416
I know, but as long as I have
my trusty ol' school swimsuit,

436
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,875
I'll make all the boys turn
into mindless animals!

You seem real sure of yourself.

438
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,541
My mistake, then.
School swimsuits have no effect.

Hey, Ako. It's Schew.

477
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,583
Nishimura said something
to you, didn't he?

478
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,833
[HIDEKI]
Hey! Come on!

479
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,791
What do ya think you're doing?
Corpse-kicking?

480
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,875
What's next, teabagging?

481
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,291
So what did Ako have to say?

482
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,333
[AKO]
Well, um...

483
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,166
He asked me if I wanted
to be his girlfriend.

484
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,291
So what did you say to him?

485
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:07,958
[AKO] I said no. Of course!
What else would I say?

486
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,166
[screams]

487
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,708
[AKO]
I mean.

488
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,416
I would consider going from
wife to girlfriend a demotion,

489
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,666
wouldn't you?

490
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,458
Either that, or it means
we're getting a divorce.

491
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,666
And definitely don't want that.

492
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,708
Well, there you have it.

493
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:25,333
Put simply, your declaration
fell through. Tough luck.

494
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,166
[chuckles]

495
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,833
[HIDEKI screams]

496
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:32,916
[NANAKO]
Hold on a second.

497
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,166
When it comes to relationships,

498
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,250
I'm obviously the most
qualified consultant!

499
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,666
Why didn't you come ask me?

500
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,291
[HIDEKI]
Oh no, I couldn't do that.

501
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,750
[NANAKO]
Why not?
