1
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,666
Well, she's friendly.
Do you know her?

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,791
No, Sette here's a total
newb as far as I've seen.

3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,333
So I offered to give her a few
pointers on how to get started.

4
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,166
[RUSIAN laughs nervously]

5
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,375
All right!

6
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,708
If you really wanna
learn the game,

7
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,458
then I, the Great Schwein,
would gladly mentor you.

8
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,541
You're named... Schwein?

9
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,666
I'll pass... but thank you.

10
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,958
Rusian... has been really nice!

11
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,000
[KYOH] Seriously? You wanna
play a different game today?

12
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,166
[AKO]
That's right.

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,958
As long as everyone else
is okay with that.

14
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,500
Sure, why not?

15
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,375
We're the Net Game Club,
so <i>LA</i> isn't the only option.

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,958
Right on.

17
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,750
So any special request for what
game we should play instead?

18
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
I was hoping for something
a bit more exhilarating.

19
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,000
Roger.

20
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,333
Then how about...
Let's give this a shot.

21
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,833
[AKANE]
<i>Ultra Force</i> ?

22
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,416
[HIDEKI]
It's an FPS.

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,375
This'll be my first First-Person
Shooter experience.

24
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,041
Do you think I'll be okay?

25
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,458
I've got an idea
that might help you.

26
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,125
Listen closely. All the enemies
in the game... are normies!

27
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,875
They're all normies?
I understand.

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,333
Let's go!

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,166
[ANNOUNCER]
Team Deathmatch!

30
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,750
Team Deathmatch!

31
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,833
You don't have to repeat
the game mode announcement.

32
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,875
[KYOH laughing]

33
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,958
[KYOH] Behold the might of
the self-destructing Bazooka!

34
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,708
One shot, five kills!

35
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,583
[AKANE] But you caught me in the
blast radius too, you dingbat!

36
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,791
Damn it!
They're out-flanking us!

37
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,500
[HIDEKI]
I'm toast.

38
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,791
[HIDEKI]
No way. Was that Ako?

39
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,958
Beautiful.

40
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,541
Did you see that?

41
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,291
At last, I think I've finally
found the perfect game for me!

42
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,666
Yeah, sure.

43
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,666
[groans]

44
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,583
I fell deep in the
<i>Ultra Force</i> rabbit hole,

45
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,916
and the next thing
I know, it's morning.

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,333
And I never would've
thought that Ako

47
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:13,125
would take to an FPS
like a fish to water.

48
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,125
Hey.

49
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,625
So what exactly were
you doing out there?

50
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,458
I thought I had inbound
hostiles on my position.

51
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,333
That's all.

52
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,375
You're way too caught up in it.

53
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
[HIDEKI]
Huh? What's wrong?

54
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,916
Over here. Normie scum.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,708
[HIDEKI]
Yeah. I guess so.

56
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,250
If only this were a
level in <i>Ultra Force</i> .

57
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,791
Huh? Hey, don't even
joke about that!

58
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,333
Don't joke about what?

59
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,541
Akiyama?

60
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,166
[NANAKO] Didn't your
club meet up yesterday?

61
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,541
Yeah, that's right.

62
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,791
That's weird.
'Cause I looked for you,

63
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,625
but couldn't find you
in your usual place.

64
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,875
[HIDEKI]
Hm?

65
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,916
[HIDEKI screams]

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,791
I was hoping you might show me
some more stuff in the game,

67
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,625
but you were nowhere
to be found.

68
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:09,166
What? You mean--?
Then you're... Sette, right?

69
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,125
--[AKANE screams]
--Yup!

70
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,541
But-But why?

71
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,000
How did you even...?

72
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,875
You guys seem to
have so much fun.

73
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,750
And Akane in particular
seems to be really into it!

74
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:24,666
[AKANE] It's over. My reputation
at this school is over.

75
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,125
And you're so nice, Nishimura.

76
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,625
I can't thank you enough
for helping me learn

77
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,958
how to play the game!

78
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,875
Totally not the impression
I got from you in class!

79
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,833
Right, well. Thank you.

80
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,916
So, Tamaki, when you said you
and Nishimura were a couple,

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,666
you only meant a couple
in the game, right?

82
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,291
[HIDEKI]
Hey, listen. Not here.

83
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,208
What's wrong? I'm just curious.

84
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,666
I wanted to find out
if you and Tamaki

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,916
were an item outside the game.

86
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,833
Ako!

87
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,708
Easy now. No need to freak out.

88
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,916
[AKANE]
It's all over and done.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,583
I-- But why, Rusian?
That's mean!

90
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,541
[BOTH gasp]

91
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,625
[AKO crying]

92
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:11,416
[AKANE]
It's over. My life is done.

93
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,541
[SAITO]
That poor, confused girl.

94
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,083
I swear, I didn't mean
to make her so angry.

95
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,875
I think her reaction
was one of shock,

96
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,583
rather than some
outburst of anger.

97
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,583
[AKANE] I bet Ako freaked out
because she thought Nanako

98
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,500
was gonna take
Nishimura away from her.

99
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,333
As if! I'm not interested
in Nishimura like that.

100
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,708
Ugh! That's gross.

101
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,791
Brutal.

102
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,625
If it had been anyone
other than Ako,

103
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,791
we could've all had a laugh and
moved on with our lives by now.

104
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,333
After everything that happened,

105
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,583
I doubt she'd appreciate all of
us showing up at her house.

106
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,375
Ako... I'm sorry.

107
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,916
Going there now would only
make her more stubborn.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,750
Yeah, it would.

109
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,083
I concur.

110
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,458
Well, for now,

111
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,583
let's just give her a little
bit of breathing room.

112
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,750
She needs some time to
process all these feelings,

113
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,875
and then I'm sure
she'll calm down.

114
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,666
We can figure out
what to do after that.

115
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,958
[SAITO] Basically, this is just
a big misunderstanding,

116
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,208
isn't that right?

117
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,208
Yeah.

118
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,375
If we can tell her
what happened,

119
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,833
it should clear everything up.

120
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,083
Fine, but how do we talk to her?

121
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,958
I've been trying to call her for
a while, but she won't answer.

122
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,958
What next? Any plan?

123
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,791
Yeah. We'll talk.

124
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,500
Great, but how?
She won't answer her phone!

125
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,583
[RUSIAN]
Ako!

126
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,291
So this is where you've been.

127
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,916
Perfect timing.

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,208
You arrived just as I
was about to level up.

129
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,208
Would you care to join me?

130
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,583
Listen up:

131
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,125
Akiyama isn't the slightest
bit interested in me.

132
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,625
I'm not her type.

133
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,291
It meant nothing--

134
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,833
Doesn't matter now.

135
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,125
I've given up on everything.

136
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,083
I forsake any life where
we're not together, Rusian.

137
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,333
What's all this
"forsaking life" stuff?

138
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,291
You don't mean?

139
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,375
I've decided to reincarnate.

140
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,375
Huh?

141
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,708
I'm maxing out my
character level,

142
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,291
and taking my chances
with the next life!

143
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,541
[groans]

144
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,083
So, uh, what're you saying?

145
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,625
Silly boy. Do you need
it spelled out for you?

146
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,333
I'm reincarnating within <i>LA</i> .
Ready to become a new character.

147
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,833
May I be reborn as someone
more cheerful and popular.

148
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,375
I'll settle for nothing less
than the total package.

149
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,500
You talked about forsaking life.

150
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,791
You're planning to do it
for real, aren't you?

151
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,208
That's correct. I've
decided to quit school.

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,000
But...

153
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,041
I'm living in <i>Legendary</i>
<i>Age</i> from now on.

154
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,041
I have no need for real life.

155
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,625
Ako... you can't.

156
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,708
[AKO] As long as
I have <i>LA</i> , I can go on.

157
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,208
This is a mistake!

158
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:01,166
[AKO] Inside this world, you're
still my faithful husband.

159
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,791
Okay. I'm gonna work
real hard to reincarnate.

160
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,458
[RUSIAN]
Wait, don't go!

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,458
[HIDEKI]
Damn it!

162
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,916
It looks like Ako's blocked
any incoming chat.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,333
She's through talking.

164
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,291
I can't believe she's
completely closed herself off

165
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,708
inside the game.

166
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,750
I guess this means the club's
purpose has backfired.

167
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,500
That might not be true.

168
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,666
Unlike last time, when she tried
to assault me with a cudgel,

169
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,375
she's only closing herself off
from the world this time.

170
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,041
Sounds like she's improving
in her own special way.

171
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, I hadn't considered
things from that perspective.

172
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,333
She needs her own way
to blow off some steam.

173
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,666
And something tells me that
Ako doesn't really believe

174
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,708
that Nanako's trying
to take you from her.

175
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,291
Guess you're right.

176
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,958
She totally made a big show out
of sulking over what happened;

177
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,166
which snowballed into a bigger
deal than it should've.

178
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,041
Once she calmed down, she
probably felt a bit embarrassed.

179
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,166
That's precisely what I thought.

180
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,166
What's more, she has a
kind-hearted young man

181
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,958
who cares for her,
and has what it takes

182
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,583
to set her back on
the right path.

183
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,000
Or so it would seem.

184
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,375
Do you really think
it's a good idea

185
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,041
to put such complete
confidence in a minor?

186
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,666
Sometimes, part of
being a good teacher

187
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,250
is having faith
in your students.

188
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,666
[HIDEKI]
You make it sound so heroic.

189
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,541
All right, I'll try.

190
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,833
I'll see her.

191
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,958
On one condition:
I handle things my own way.

192
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,458
[AKANE] A word of
advice before you start.

193
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,458
Ako knows perfectly well how
ditzy she can be sometimes.

194
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,000
It takes her forever to learn
enemy attack patterns.

195
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,541
And I'd say half of
those, she forgets.

196
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,958
I mean, imagine the first poor
bastards she played with in <i>LA</i> .

197
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,000
They all gradually disappeared.

198
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,041
[HIDEKI]
That sounds about right.

199
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,291
But you... you weren't
like the others.

200
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,708
If things ever went belly up,

201
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,750
you'd say "We'll get
'em next time,"

202
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,375
promising there <i>would</i>
be a next time.

203
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,583
When you stuck with her
hopelessly inept character

204
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,875
in the game, it was like you
accepted the real life Ako.

205
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,500
She said that you were
the kind of person

206
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,458
she could stay with forever.

207
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,500
And she had such a
stupid grin on her face

208
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,291
you'd swear her brain was gonna
melt and pour out of her ears.

209
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,583
Did she? I never knew.

210
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,000
Funny thing is,
I feel the same.

211
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,333
[HIDEKI]
Uh.

212
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,625
[AKANE] And like Ako,
I get the feeling

213
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,708
you're someone I could hang
out with forever, too.

214
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,875
[gasps]

215
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,208
When I say hang out,

216
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,666
I mean playing games
together in a club setting,

217
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,333
or online from our own homes.

218
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,458
You get what I'm
trying to say, right?

219
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,041
Yeah, I think so.

220
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,583
What I mean is,
it could've been worse,

221
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,500
but I ended up getting
stuck with you.

222
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,875
And you got stuck with me.

223
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,416
As well as that reclusive psycho
and Little Miss Money Bags.

224
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,833
Look. Just make sure
you bring Ako back to us.

225
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,166
Deal! I'm on the case.

226
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,958
Great! Now, I'd say my
work here is done. Heh.

227
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,958
[door opens]

228
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,833
[AKO'S MOTHER]
Excuse me, young man?

229
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:23,500
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

230
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
How can I help you?

231
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,875
[HIDEKI yelps]

232
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,333
Uh, hello! I'm Mister Hideki
Nishimura, Esquire, or Sir.

233
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,541
In game.

234
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,041
[AKO'S MOTHER]
Uh...

235
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,833
You're the online husband
I've heard so much about!

236
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,041
[HIDEKI]
Uh?

237
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,541
[HIDEKI]
She told you?

238
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,875
Yeah. My folks and I
don't talk that much,

239
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,625
especially not about my games.

240
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,166
[AKO'S MOTHER]
Oh, I see.

241
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,500
So what brings my virtual
son-in-law over?

242
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,166
I take it you've come to visit
my problem daughter.

243
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,708
Yes, that's right.

244
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,916
I just--

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,541
I came to visit Ako
to see how she was.

246
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,125
I'm cutting school right now.

247
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you really? All for her?

248
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,291
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,708
I see.

250
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,833
Even though she says that
she's through with school?

251
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,583
I guess. Whatever that's worth.

252
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,166
[AKO'S MOTHER]
Hmm...

253
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,458
[giggles]

254
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,333
Huh? You giggled. What is it?

255
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,250
[AKO'S MOTHER giggles]

256
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,500
[gasps] Oh!

257
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,250
Look at me, I'm sitting
here chatting with you,

258
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,666
when I should be
heading off to work!

259
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,958
Please check on her,
if you don't mind.

260
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,166
What, you mean it?

261
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,583
Of course!

262
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,333
Besides, one day it won't
be me taking care of her.

263
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,125
Something tells me that job will
fall to you one way or another.

264
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,708
[HIDEKI]
Oh, wow, uh...

265
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,958
I'm not ready for that kind
of responsibility yet.

266
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,500
[AKO'S MOTHER] Oh, nice
and honest. I like that.

267
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,541
This is yours.

268
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,750
What's that?

269
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,833
[AKO'S MOTHER]
It's the key to Ako's room.

270
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,083
[HIDEKI]
Ako, it's me!

271
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,083
[AKO]
Huh? Rusian?

272
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,000
Sorry to drop by without
warning. Can I come in?

273
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,000
[AKO]
Uhh... What are you doing here?

274
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,333
You should be at school!
Where's my mom?

275
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,333
She asked me to
look out for you.

276
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,500
She even left me
a key to your room.

277
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,000
[AKO]
Mom! That is way uncool!

278
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,666
[HIDEKI] She also entrusted
me with your future.

279
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,916
[AKO] You've done
a bang-up job so far!

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,625
[HIDEKI] Which means I won't
take "no" for an answer!

281
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,083
I'm letting myself in.

282
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,333
[AKO] Whoa, wait a second!
No! Don't do that!

283
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,708
[HIDEKI] You can't hide
from reality anymore!

284
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,291
I'm coming in!

285
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,750
[whimpering]

286
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,958
[HIDEKI]
What the heck was that?!

287
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,625
Why are you in your
freakin' underwear?!

288
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,000
[AKO] I just like to feel
free and uninhibited

289
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,333
when I'm in the privacy
of my own room!

290
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,416
You know how it goes!

291
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,250
So just hold on.

292
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,083
I need to get ready.

293
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,666
Yeah.

294
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,708
[AKO]
Okay, come in.

295
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,291
Please be gentle.

296
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,250
What's wrong?
Aren't you coming in?

297
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,000
What the hell's wrong with you?!

298
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,916
You said you needed to get
ready, but you just got naked!

299
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,208
[AKO]
I was preparing myself mentally!

300
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,500
[HIDEKI] That's not the kind
of preparation I intended!

301
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,750
Could you please
put some clothes on?

302
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,000
[AKO]
Go ahead.

303
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,333
[HIDEKI]
Cool, thank you.

304
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,833
Dude, you have a fridge
in your room?

305
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,500
[AKO] I try to be prepared
to go a week straight

306
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,166
without leaving my room,
so I need some provisions.

307
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,708
Surely you have to
go to the restroom

308
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,791
at some point during
a seven day stretch.

309
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,541
[AKO]
There's no need to go anywhere.

310
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,041
I use plastic bottles.

311
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,083
[gasps]

312
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,458
[HIDEKI]
No way. Did she really?

313
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,958
I'm gonna... I'm gonna hurl.

314
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,875
I'm just messing with you.

315
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,250
I personally brewed
the tea this morning.

316
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,333
Couldn't you tell
from the taste?

317
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,875
How am I supposed to
know what it tastes like?

318
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,375
I've never drunk any!

319
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,250
C'mon, Rusian, the plastic
bottle thing was just a joke.

320
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,750
I use the restroom like
a regular person.

321
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,666
Between the nudity and the pee,
my heart can't take much more.

322
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,791
[AKO]
So... I was wondering.

323
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,916
What brings you here, Rusian?

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,625
I know what it is.

325
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,000
You came to try to get me
to go back to school.

326
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,000
Not today.

327
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,875
[gasps]

328
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,291
Today we're gonna
have some fun.

329
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,041
Huh?

330
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,208
[HIDEKI] Remember,
the highest-ranked clerics

331
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,291
manage the cooldown times
of each of their healing skills.

332
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,041
Using the right skill at the
right time will chain combos,

333
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,583
which boosts their power.

334
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,000
And don't forget to buff your
allies and debuff the enemy.

335
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,166
Also, having a couple
elixirs in your hotbar

336
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,541
will help you hedge your bets
if things start going south.

337
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,708
Those are the basics
rules for ideal play.

338
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,500
You got it?

339
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,041
I don't "got it"!

340
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,291
And I don't really understand
what's happening right now!

341
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,291
[HIDEKI chuckles]

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,583
Well, you said you're
trying to cap your level

343
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,750
and reincarnate, right?

344
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,166
Then you ought to
learn this stuff now,

345
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,458
or you'll never get anywhere.

346
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,083
Yeah, I guess you make
a pretty good point.

347
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,375
Of course! That's why
I'm tutoring you.

348
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,958
Ugh! You might be asking
too much from me!

349
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,291
No time to whine!

350
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,500
I'll stick with you until
you've got it locked!

351
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,083
[AKO]
Okay.

352
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,166
[HIDEKI]
Let's roll!

353
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,125
Watch out, that
werewolf's squaring off!

354
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,250
He's winding up.
Get ready to start healing!

355
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,833
[AKO]
O-Okay. Like this?

356
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,166
[HIDEKI] Your tempo's way too
fast for your cooldown times.

357
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,666
You're breaking all your combos.

358
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,208
But it's hard. How was that?

359
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,750
If you can chain the
timing just right,

360
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,916
you should be able
to secure the combo.

361
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,500
Then your cooldown time fits
within your response time.

362
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,958
[AKO]
I see. Is that better?

363
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,375
[HIDEKI] You're mixing up
your skills. It's this one.

364
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,333
This is impossible!

365
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,708
No it isn't.

366
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,791
If you want to reincarnate,
push it to the limit!

367
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,250
[AKO]
Okay.

368
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,250
[HIDEKI] Pay attention.
Your timing is still too fast.

369
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,166
[AKO sighs]

370
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,583
There we go. Was that right?

371
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,083
[beeping]

372
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,625
Oh. Looks like Schew
and Master have come online.

373
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,708
[AKO gasps]

374
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,958
[AKO]
Is it club meeting time already?

375
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,083
[HIDEKI] Ako, mind if
I borrow this cable?

376
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,750
[AKO]
Huh? Sure.

377
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,708
[HIDEKI]
Thank you.

378
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,625
I'll log in on this laptop
I borrowed from Master.

379
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,541
Signing on. Good.

380
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,083
All right, you knuckleheads,

381
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,875
what's so important that
you had to miss school?

382
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:30,875
We played together.

383
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,333
[AKO, AKANE gasp]

384
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,041
[AKANE] I oughta drop
kick the both of you!

385
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,291
What in the world were
the two of you thinking?

386
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,541
Me-yeah!

387
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,291
If they find out you cut
school to goof around,

388
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,375
they'll drop the hammer!

389
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,208
Sorry, Teach.

390
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,291
I'm nyat your teacher.
I'm Nekohime!

391
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,208
Hey, Nekohime, I needed
to have a chat with you.

392
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:51,833
You mind?

393
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,916
[NEKOHIME]
Hm?

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,833
What's the matter, Rusian?

395
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,000
No biggie.

396
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,958
I quit school.

397
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:57,833
Huh?!

398
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,500
You can't be serious about that.

399
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,125
[RUSIAN] But if Ako's quitting
school, why can't I?

400
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,708
To be honest, dealing with all
the "nerd-taku weeb" cracks

401
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,083
gets old.

402
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,083
My time would be better
spent playing <i>LA</i> .

403
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,041
That sounds stressful.

404
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,958
I wish you the best
of luck, Rusian.

405
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,250
Please don't, Rusian.

406
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,750
On one condition:
I handle things my own way.

407
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,291
My paws are tied. Very well.

408
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,458
No! You can't, Rusian!

409
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,750
[HIDEKI]
Why not?

410
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,083
If it's okay for you,
why not for me too?

411
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,833
You can't! Because if you
really drop out of school...

412
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:40,791
The others. Master and Schew
will miss you. That's sad.

413
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,208
[HIDEKI]
True.

414
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,041
But if you quit, Ako,
won't that be the same thing?

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,500
[AKO]
I guess.

416
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,750
Neither of them are
chatting back anymore.

417
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,791
[KYOH]
But it doesn't look like

418
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,500
they've disabled
their chat windows.

419
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,875
Sounds to me like
they must be busy.

420
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,333
But busy with what?

421
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,666
I'm gonna go ahead
and log out for now.

422
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
I'd say Rusian's done
an excellent job

423
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,333
bringing Ako this far.

424
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,500
For now, let's just wait
for Mister Nishimura

425
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,833
to convince Miss Tamaki
to come back to us.

426
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,333
What do you say?

427
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,958
Ako, I get it.

428
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,375
You aren't the only one
who dislikes school.

429
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,958
You have a hard time
making friends,

430
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,375
and you feel out
of place in class.

431
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,875
This whole situation you're
facing is a tough one,

432
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,500
and you're unsure of what to do.

433
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,500
You don't have any fun
outside the club,

434
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,250
so you don't wanna go.

435
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,250
That's the truth, isn't it?

436
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,166
Then Akiyama coming in
brought things to a boil,

437
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,250
and you felt like
you lost control.

438
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,333
At least, that's how
it seems to me.

439
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,500
[AKO] But how did you
know all of that--

440
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,833
everything I was
feeling, Rusian?

441
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,125
Because I'm your husband, dork.

442
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,583
[HIDEKI]
Did you have fun today?

443
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,000
I did! Tons of it!

444
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,958
[HIDEKI]
Awesome, me too.

445
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,250
So should we both drop out?

446
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,000
We could do this every day.

447
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,875
I used to think that as
long as there's the game,

448
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,083
it would be enough.

449
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,000
And in this world, I thought
I'd found the real me,

450
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,166
but I was wrong.

451
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,750
Totally.

452
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,833
Now, thanks to the club,

453
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,083
and most especially
because of you,

454
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,708
I've realized that life
doesn't always suck.

455
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,000
Schew feels the same,

456
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,458
wishing she could be
stuck with us forever.

457
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,125
With you, and me, and Master.

458
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,916
I'd like that. It would be
great if that were possible.

459
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,791
But real life?

460
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,916
Real life is way too hard.

461
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,833
Yeah, I know.

462
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,416
But hey...

463
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,125
It'll be all right!

464
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,750
Put a little time into real
life, then have fun!

465
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,041
We can play for hours, Ako!
Whatever game you want!

466
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,666
And when you feel like
you can handle it,

467
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,666
you can give the real
world another shot.

468
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,875
And if we can't play
hooky together again,

469
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,708
I'll be waiting for you
up at school, all right?

470
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,958
[AKO]
Rusian.

471
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,791
Ako.

472
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:15,166
[AKO] If I try, and I mean
really try, but then get tired,

473
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,833
will you stay home
with me again?

474
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,666
Of course I will.

475
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,875
For the sake of
my loving wife.

476
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,708
All right. Then I think
I can do it.

477
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,875
[GIRL A]
Hey Tamaki!

478
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,708
Uh. Hello.

479
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,000
[GIRL B] You were gone again
yesterday. What happened?

480
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,458
Well, I--

481
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,208
Sorry, is something wrong?

482
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,583
[GIRL B] You're not still
contagious, are you?

483
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,041
Good morning!
Can you believe it?

484
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,625
Ako's so lucky.

485
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,333
Her boyfriend's in my class, and
you'll never guess what he did!

486
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,416
When he heard that
she'd stayed home,

487
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,583
he actually left school
to go over to her house

488
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,958
and check in on her!

489
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,041
Yeah? The rumors were true!

490
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,416
Tamaki, you have, like,
the best boyfriend!

491
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,541
I want a man who'll skip school
to come check in on me!

492
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,666
But I'm alone.

493
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,458
Girl, you are fierce!

494
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,583
She, like, hit the jackpot!

495
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,875
Yeah!

496
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,625
[giggles]

497
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,541
You're right!
My boyfriend's the best!

498
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:32,958
[AKO] When the door
to my room was closed,

499
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,375
did you think I was
fully dressed?

500
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,375
[HIDEKI] Of course I did!
What else would I expect?

501
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,208
[AKO]
Guess what! I was buck naked!

502
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,833
[HIDEKI] Would you put some
clothes on? I can't take it!
