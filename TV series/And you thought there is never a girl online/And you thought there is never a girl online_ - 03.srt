1
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,208
Long time nyao see!

2
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,708
Get it?

3
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,500
Yeah, long time no see.

4
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,041
[NEKOHIME] It's nice to know
you're still enjoying the game.

5
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,583
Of course! It's awesome.

6
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,416
That's excellent!

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,625
I worried you might've quit
playing after we talked.

8
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,250
But myew're still here!

9
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,125
[RUSIAN] You really are girlish
and adorable, Nekohime...

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,375
...considering you're
an older dude.

11
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,916
[RUSIAN] Oh, no.
What happened back then

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,958
was actually a good
experience for me.

13
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,500
In fact, I took what
I learned from that

14
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,041
and made it my personal mantra.

15
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,083
Mantra?

16
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,416
That's right.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,875
"Role-Playing has nothing
to do with real life.

18
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,875
The game is not reality."

19
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,458
[laughing]

20
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,208
[RUSIAN]
So how about yourself, Nekohime?

21
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,375
Looks like you haven't
logged in in a while!

22
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,458
[NEKOHIME] My work schedule's
been extra hectic lately.

23
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,333
I heard someone mention
the game IRL,

24
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,041
and I thought it was the
purr-fect time to log back in!

25
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,916
And here you are!

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,458
I'm glad we bumped into
each other, Rusian!

27
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,791
[groans]

28
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,625
Why are you here? What's wrong?

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,041
Nothing!

30
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,125
I just came to pay my morning
respects to my master!

31
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,541
Uh, look, this is awkward.

32
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,041
That's only in the game, okay?

33
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,000
It doesn't transfer over
to the real world.

34
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,916
So could you, maybe,
cut that crap out?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,916
Aww...

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,708
"Aww." Back 'atcha.

37
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,291
And another thing,
calling me master

38
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,250
makes you sound less like my
wife, and more like my maid.

39
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,666
I guess so. Well then...

40
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,416
How're you this morning?

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,250
Well? Husband? Dear?

42
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,500
You're ignoring that?

43
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,708
[HIDEKI]
Hmm...

44
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,791
I'm sorry, Ako, but that
quest line is closed

45
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,583
until further
requirements are met.

46
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,583
[AKO]
Huh? So if I level up,

47
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,166
will it raise our
affection rating too?

48
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,500
[NANAKO]
What's going on?

49
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,250
Did they get to know each
other in some game?

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,750
[AKANE]
Beats me.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,166
Good morning!

52
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,250
[STUDENTS]
Good morning, miss!

53
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,500
See you later!

54
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,750
Cool.

55
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,583
Nishimura. A moment
of your time?

56
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,625
Mister Nishimura,
have you and Miss Tamaki

57
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,958
started seeing each other?

58
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,791
Ah! No! Ma'am,
it's not like that!

59
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,250
[SAITO]
But you do get along?

60
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,625
Yeah, I guess so.

61
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,750
Thanks for helping her
feel like she belongs.

62
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,458
From what I've seen, Miss Tamaki
doesn't have too many friends.

63
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,958
She's also been missing
a lot of school lately.

64
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,875
Well, that's no good.

65
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,875
Miss Goshoin.

66
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,416
Oh, Mast-- Uh! Madam President.

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,625
Hey, nice to see you, Hideki.

68
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,750
Hi, Ms. Saito. Regarding
what we spoke about--

69
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,291
Oh yes. Please
accept my apologies,

70
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,541
but I'm needed in the
literary club right now.

71
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,000
Of course,

72
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,666
but if you could at least
give me a name to jot down.

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,833
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,541
"H-e-l-l-o, Rusian."
And enter!

75
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,583
You do realize you don't
have to type to chat.

76
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,125
That's right! I forgot.

77
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,416
[AKANE] Ha! Sword upgrade!
It's so light!

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,833
Aww yeah!

79
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,208
Let's go to the Bluemke
Mega-volcano today, you guys!

80
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,291
Good idea.

81
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,416
Okay! Time for everyone
to gear up!

82
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,250
[HIDEKI, AKO, AKANE]
Yeah!

83
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,666
Hey, Ako. Mind if I take
a look at your gear?

84
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,666
[AKO]
Okay, go ahead.

85
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,125
Wow, that is completely nutso.

86
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,291
What is?

87
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,625
If we're going to fight
in a mega-volcano,

88
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,541
why are you wearing robes
with water resistance?

89
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, my robe?

90
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,416
You gave it to me, Rusian,
so of course I'm wearing it!

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,333
[HIDEKI] But you need one
with fire resistance!

92
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,750
[AKO] But my water resistance
robe is a lot cuter.

93
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,708
You're too focused
on your appearance.

94
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,791
And what's so great about
this pink star glitter wand

95
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,791
you've been waving around?

96
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,375
When you hit an enemy with it,

97
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,125
it sparkles and
shoots out stars!

98
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,791
It's like, mega-adorable!

99
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,958
[AKANE] Those stupid stars
were coming from you?

100
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,791
[AKO giggling]

101
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,166
[HIDEKI grumbles]

102
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,125
[AKO gasps]

103
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,875
[AKO] Are you implying
all my gear is useless?

104
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,250
That's an understatement.

105
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,750
Your build is a joke.

106
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,708
[HIDEKI] I've got a wand of
benevolence in my inventory

107
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,666
that you can borrow.

108
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,875
[AKO]
Oh, I've got that.

109
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
[HIDEKI]
Then freakin' use it!

110
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,500
[laughing]

111
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,000
That's great. Now the Master's
cackling like a lunatic.

112
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,083
[AKO] Ugh. This ugly flame robe
doesn't complement my style

113
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,625
in the slightest.

114
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,833
It's on!

115
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,916
[KYOH] All right. Time for
a taste of my umaibo staff!

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Come and get it!

117
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,333
Uh.

118
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,000
What're you doing, Schwein?

119
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,500
Why are you holding my arm?

120
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,875
I thought we'd agreed that
premium items are off limits.

121
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,458
Oh, in that case,

122
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't have any
equipment I can use.

123
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,166
Wait a second.

124
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,041
Is your inventory full
of premium items?

125
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,333
Master, you promised.

126
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,541
No premium item use
while we quest together.

127
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,916
Don't boss me!

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Did you forget I'm club
president and Guild Master?

129
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,458
Oh, shut up!

130
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,666
Ha! Behold the
deadliness of my blade!

131
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,958
[RUSIAN] Your sword looks the
same to us as it always has.

132
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,958
Seems like Schew is having fun.

133
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,416
Uh! I deserve to have a
"woot" moment as well!

134
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,333
Sure thing! Just no premiums.

135
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,791
[KYOH groans]

136
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,041
[RUSIAN]
Here come two more!

137
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,666
This is foolish, but fine.
No premium weapons.

138
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
Let them come!

139
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,708
They can chew on the power
of this regular staff

140
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,416
that I've upgraded with
premium buffing items!

141
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,083
Now, Perfect Blizzard!

142
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,916
Well that got their attention.

143
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,750
Master just got pwned.

144
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,250
Don't open with your best move!

145
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,958
Maybe tone down
the "woot" factor!

146
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,625
[KYOH]
If I'd had my premium staves,

147
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,708
I would have overkilled
the lot of them.

148
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,541
[RUSIAN]
Ako! Cast Resurrect!

149
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,916
[AKO]
Okay.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,166
I forgot to customize my
skill settings on this rig.

151
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,458
Do any of you guys know what
the "Resurrect" icon looks like?

152
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,916
It's this one here,
then you gotta click "Heal."

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ah! Wow, you really know
your stuff, Rusian!

154
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,166
[AKANE sighs]

155
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,583
[AKANE]
That seemed a lot more stressful

156
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,833
than our usual
grinding sessions.

157
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,625
[KYOH] But we learned
from our mistakes

158
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,208
and our efficiency went up!

159
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,708
That only happened
because Nishimura

160
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,208
was working half
of Ako's controls.

00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,791
Thanks for sharing your
strength and skill.

[HIDEKI gasps]

163
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,333
I feel like I was more
useful to everyone today

164
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,583
because of you.

165
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,958
Yeah, no sweat. Glad to help.

166
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,083
[AKO sighs]

167
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,291
I haven't missed a day of school

168
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,958
since we started
the Net Game Club,

169
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,291
but I'm feeling
stretched too thin,

170
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,166
and could probably
use a bit of a break.

171
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,000
You've gotta show up.
You can't graduate otherwise.

172
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,250
That won't be a problem

173
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,125
because you're going
to support me, Rusian.

174
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,666
So really, whatever happens
along the way doesn't matter.

175
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,375
Whoa. I think I'd remember
agreeing to something like that.

176
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,875
[AKO gasps]

177
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,333
Don't tell me you want us to
become a dual-income couple!

178
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,666
If I had to actually choose,
two incomes sounds safest.

179
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,166
Uh. What did you say?

180
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,208
Two incomes sounds safer.

181
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,500
Uh. Could you repeat that again?

182
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,166
Not funny.

183
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,750
[AKO giggles]

184
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,750
Is something wrong, Rusian?

185
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,083
No.

186
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,833
I just realized I'm
starting to get used to

187
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,458
being called by my
name from the game.

188
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,750
[AKO]
Oh, sorry. Nishimura. I forgot.

189
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,458
[HIDEKI]
Let's make a pit-stop.

190
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,708
What was that?

191
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,500
I was thinking it's kinda
like we're in <i>LA</i> right now.

192
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,875
Nope, this is the real
world, without a doubt.

193
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,291
[AKO] Ya think people walking by
have any idea we're married?

194
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,458
[HIDEKI]
Doesn't sound very likely.

195
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,208
For one thing, I'm nowhere
close to marrying age yet.

196
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,291
I might look like
your boyfr-- Ah.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,875
So, it's starting to
get late. Is that okay?

198
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,166
[AKO] Yeah. My parents
are barely ever home.

199
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,291
[HIDEKI]
Oh, really?

200
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,041
If they weren't
gone all the time,

201
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,625
I couldn't be up
gaming every night!

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,666
It's just that,
from what I've seen,

203
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,583
Miss Tamaki doesn't
have too many friends.

204
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,708
[AKO]
The sunset is so beautiful.

205
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,000
[HIDEKI]
Ready to go?

206
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,958
[AKO]
Sure!

207
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,208
[HIDEKI groans]

208
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,375
[HIDEKI] How 'bout we
all take a little break?

209
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,833
Ako's healing abilities have
been noticeably improving.

210
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,166
Which means less dying.

211
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,000
Amazing what you can do
with the right gear.

212
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,333
I'm going to step out
for a few moments.

213
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,791
[HIDEKI] Do you need
to go to the restroom?

214
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,250
You shouldn't ask a lady that!

215
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,083
Right! Let's do this!

216
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey! What's going on here?

[KYOH laughs]

221
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375
That's because it's
been fully maxed out!

222
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,250
You love spending money
on the weirdest nonsense!

223
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,166
[KYOH]
I think we should call it a day.

224
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,875
[AKO] We accomplished
quite a lot, didn't we?

225
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,625
I've gotta say. You handled
yourself pretty well this time.

226
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,083
Rusian just complimented me!

227
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,958
Please! Hasn't this club
thing been kinda pointless?

228
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,375
[HIDEKI]
How so?

229
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,916
The entire reason
we started this

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,500
was to help Ako re-integrate
into the real world.

231
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,375
Yeah. So what?

232
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,791
[AKANE]
Because instead of doing that,

233
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,250
it seems like we're
making the boundary

234
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,375
between the game and
reality even blurrier.

235
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,708
We're all having fun,
why does it matter?

236
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,875
[KYOH]
No, it is a bit of a problem.

237
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,125
[HIDEKI]
Master?

238
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,166
It's simple.

239
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,583
There's the problem
of a time limit

240
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,541
closing in on the Net Game Club.

241
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,125
We don't have an advisor.

242
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,500
Without an advisor,

243
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,208
we don't have the formal
presence to maintain a club.

244
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,041
We'll probably be
disbanded soon.

245
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,791
Before that, we're gonna
try to achieve our goal.

246
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,166
[RUSIAN]
Yo, Nekohime!

247
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,791
[NEKOHIME]
Hm? Rusian!

248
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,083
I, uh...

249
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,208
I hoped you could
give me some advice.

250
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,958
[NEKOHIME]
Hmm... That is a pickle.

251
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,750
[RUSIAN] It doesn't seem
like she can distinguish

252
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,916
between real life
and the game.

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,125
[NEKOHIME]
I get it.

254
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,625
I just heard a similar
tale quite recently.

255
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,375
I don't know how else to
say it, but she's at risk.

256
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,750
One false step and your friend

257
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,166
is going to have
a really hard fall.

258
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,041
But you won't let
that happen, will you?

259
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,041
No. I hope not.

260
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,541
Believe in yourself!

261
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,333
[RUSIAN] Just keep doing
what I've been doing?

262
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,041
It can't be that easy.

263
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,000
So, uh, could I ask for your
advice again sometime?

264
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,041
Abso-mew-tly.

265
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,125
[HIDEKI]
Ako. I mean, Tamaki.

266
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,500
Come take a seat for a minute.

267
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,583
Uh. Yes, Rusian? What's wrong?

268
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,291
[HIDEKI]
I'm not Rusian. I'm Nishimura.

269
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,291
Huh? Oh, right. Yes, Nishimura?

270
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,500
This club is going to
come to an end soon,

271
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
so I'm going to say
this one more time.

272
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,666
The game and
reality are separate.

273
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,916
Like how your
character is married

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,625
to my character in the game,

275
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,333
but here at school,
we're ordinary classmates.

276
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,875
So let's try treating each
other like regular friends.

277
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,208
[gasps]

278
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,708
Also, if you haven't met IRL,

279
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,291
you should never let
your guard down.

280
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,083
Even if you <i>know</i>
them from the game.

281
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:15,041
Rusian, who's been planting
these ideas in your ear?

282
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,416
You met someone else,
didn't you?

283
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,000
And they said something
to change your mind.

284
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,291
Was it a woman?

285
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,166
No, why would you
even think that?

286
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
[I see. Another woman.

287
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,708
No, you're wrong.

288
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,375
Rusian, a wife can
tell with a glance

289
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,250
if her husband has been
unfaithful to her.

290
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,541
Look, I'm no cheater!

291
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,458
[AKO]
Could I ask for her name?

292
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,500
What for?

293
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,000
[AKO]
I wanna pay my respects.

294
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,166
No, please don't!

295
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,750
Why not, silly?

296
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,625
I just want to meet the
woman giving my husband

297
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,791
a helping hand and
thank her in person!

298
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,708
Of all the crazy
things you've said,

299
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,791
that was the scariest.

300
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,708
Oh, you have no idea.

301
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,125
'Cause you're already beaten!

302
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,375
I'm so angry it's almost flipped
back around to euphoric!

303
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,708
[HIDEKI] Wow, would you
look at the time?

304
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,000
[RUSIAN] It got ugly. She saw
through me in a second.

305
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,333
[laughs]

306
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,416
That story is
absolutely purr-fect!

307
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,041
Hi, Rusian.
So who's your friend?

308
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,041
Ah! Ako!

309
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,208
Do you like it when that woman
makes all of those cat noises?

310
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,583
Is that what mew're looking for

311
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,333
in the girl of your
dreams, Rusian?

312
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,250
[RUSIAN]
Don't you start doing it.

313
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,166
That was just an old
acquaintance of mine.

314
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,666
Remember that story
about the cross-player

315
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,125
I declared my love to?

316
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,958
[gasps]

317
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,833
That's who you confessed your
love to, Rusian? That one?

318
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,166
I'm so jealous. How outrageous.

319
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,458
Agh! What an awful
person she is!

320
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,375
Tell us what you really think.

321
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,375
She threw my darling Rusian's
heart through the meat grinder!

322
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,875
I'll teach her!
I'll make her pay!

323
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,583
Stop it, dummy!
Stalking me is one thing,

324
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,833
but I'm not gonna let you go off

325
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,000
and bother poor
Nekohime as well.

326
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,208
But Rusian...

327
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,333
[RUSIAN] You got that?
I mean it this time!

328
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,041
I understand.

329
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:08,208
Well, I have business
to attend to. Pardon me.

330
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,583
[RUSIAN]
Hey! Hold on!

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Mister Nishimura?

332
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,041
Have you seen Miss
Tamaki around today?

333
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,208
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

334
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,000
[KYOH] She was playing in
the game last night, right?

335
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,541
Same as always.

336
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,250
Huh?

337
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,291
Ako!

338
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,458
[AKANE]
What is that girl up to now?

339
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,250
[RUSIAN]
Why aren't you in school?

340
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,416
[AKO] I have some important
business to attend to,

341
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,208
so I took the day off.

342
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,916
What's so important?

343
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,208
Offline meeting.

344
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,833
Offline?

345
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,916
I guess. I didn't know about it.

346
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,250
With who?

347
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,333
A person to person meet-up
with a player I know.

348
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,541
[AKANE]
Someone you know? In <i>LA</i> ?

349
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,875
Yes.

350
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,958
Is this someone that we
would be acquainted with?

351
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,250
No, I don't think so.

352
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,541
Really?

353
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,916
I thought you didn't know
anyone else on here,

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,208
other than the three of us.

355
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,541
One of your girlfriends,
I assume?

356
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,666
[AKO] Actually, this person
told me he was a male.

357
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,666
But I still haven't met
him face-to-face yet.

358
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,791
[HIDEKI]
Uh?!

359
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,375
An offline meeting
with an unknown man?

360
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,416
[KYOH]
Hmm...

361
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,958
Wait! Don't do this!
It's dangerous!

362
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,541
He's right!

363
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,541
And besides, you've still got
Rusian here to keep you company.

364
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,041
That's true.

365
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,708
I have a dashing husband
named Rusian.

366
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,208
Well, there you go.

367
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,541
But like you told me, that's
only in the game, isn't it?

368
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,208
You said the game and
reality were separate.

369
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,583
[grunts]

370
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,750
Can you explain?

371
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,916
The game and reality,
what's the big difference?

372
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,375
Hold on a second.

373
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,125
You don't sound like your
usual self today, Ako.

374
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,750
[AKO]
I'm going to head out now.

375
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,916
Unless you object, I'll leave.

376
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

377
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,125
Suit yourself.

378
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,375
Come on!

379
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,750
Do you really mean that?

380
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,875
Are you sure?

381
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,500
What's the big deal?

382
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,041
We finally got Ako
to acknowledge

383
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,708
that there's a separation
between the game and reality.

384
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,000
We've achieved what
we set out to do

385
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,833
when we created this club.

386
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,875
Guess everything's worked out!

387
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,500
[AKO]
Can you explain?

388
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:24,083
The game and reality,
what's the big difference?

389
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,250
Damn!

390
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,041
[AKANE]
What're you standing around for?

391
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,250
What do you mean?

392
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,708
[KYOH]
Ako's offline meeting is set

393
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,333
for six o'clock this evening.

394
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,958
Schew managed to
get that out of her.

395
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,208
Six o'clock tonight?

396
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,958
It's happening in front
of Maegasaki Station,

397
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,125
just like when we met up.

398
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,500
You've got to hurry
and stop her!

399
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,750
But I-- I don't have that right.

400
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,166
[AKANE] Are you still pulling
that melancholy nonsense?

401
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,416
We don't have time for this!

402
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,541
She is still your
wife, isn't she?

403
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,500
She isn't my wife! Well,
she is, but only in the game.

404
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,916
In real life,
she's just a friend.

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,458
She said so herself.

406
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,375
[AKANE] What is your problem,
moron? You are so lame!

407
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,875
I've known you were
a dork for a long time,

408
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,791
but I never thought you
had donkey-brains!

409
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,000
Shut up.

410
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,875
[AKANE sighs]

411
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,250
[AKANE] I get it.
You like Ako, don't you?

412
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,375
Then that's enough, isn't it?
Now go and stop her!

413
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,125
You aren't really gonna
let the girl you like

414
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,958
walk into danger?

415
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,208
He won't. Will you?
Because you're better than that.

416
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,125
In fact, the way I see it,

417
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,916
Ako may be guilty
of blurring the lines

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
between the game and reality,

419
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,375
whereas you are
the complete opposite,

420
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,375
assuming little connection
between the two.

421
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,458
Yeah, but...

422
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,583
[KYOH]
The real you is much different

423
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,583
from your character in the game.

424
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,833
The same can be said
of the two Akos,

425
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,625
but she sees the Rusian in you.

426
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,041
It's natural to feel affection

427
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,541
for such a regular
part of your life.

428
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,250
It's not that.
You're missing the point.

429
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,500
[AKANE]
What do you mean?

430
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,416
It's something more than that!

431
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,750
After meeting the real deal Ako,
talking to her, touching her,

432
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,625
I've realized I really like
the non-game Ako too.

433
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,125
And it isn't even
my digital wife

434
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm worried about right now.

435
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,208
I'm worried about the real Ako!

436
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,833
I hope she's all right.

437
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,125
The last thing I want
is for her to get hurt!

438
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,125
Really?

439
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,375
That's right!

440
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,750
It's true. The game and
reality are different!

441
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,000
Good enough.

442
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,333
I guess you just answered
your own question.

443
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,333
So hurry up and
get outta here!

444
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,666
Yeah!

445
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,208
What absolute basket
cases. Both of 'em.

446
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,166
Oh, definitely.

447
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,250
[HIDEKI]
Ako!

448
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,125
Rusian?

449
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,791
Ako!

450
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,250
As your husband,

451
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,666
I disapprove of any offline
meetings with strange men!

452
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,583
Things may be different
in the real world,

453
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,166
but in the game, you and I
are still husband and wife!

454
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,791
Oh, Rusian.

455
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,583
Rusian... is Nishimura?

456
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,583
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

457
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
Hang on. Miss Saito?

458
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,458
This is the real Nekohime!

459
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,708
[HIDEKI]
Huh?!

460
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,000
Whoa! Wait a sec!

461
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,583
No way. You're wrong.

462
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,625
Nekohime told me she was
actually an older man.

463
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,708
Not true!

464
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,458
As I see with my own two eyes.

465
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,000
Ever since I saw the cat girl,
I knew she was really female!

466
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,541
And when I invited her
to meet in person,

467
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,083
Miss Saito showed up.

468
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,958
[HIDEKI]
It could just be coincidence.

469
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,333
No, she's right.
I am Nekohime.

470
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,875
[HIDEKI gasping]

471
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,375
[AKO] Busted!

472
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,375
[SAITO]
Yesterday, I chatted with Ako.

473
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,208
I mean, Miss Tamaki, in <i>LA</i> .

474
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,416
Nekohime is actually Saito?

475
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,333
Then... Nekohime was a
woman the whole time?

476
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,708
Which means... I proposed
to my homeroom teacher?

477
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,291
I am so sorry.

478
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,291
As you can see,
it causes a lot of trouble,

479
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,208
so I pose as a
cross-player in game.

480
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:58,958
No. Just... wait...
I need time to process.

481
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,958
[AKO] How dare you toy
with a heart as pure

482
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,166
as my beloved Rusian's!

483
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,500
You wicked crone!

484
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,125
I don't care if
you are a teacher.

485
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,291
As his wife, I will
have my vengeance!

486
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,708
En garde!

487
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,208
[screams]

488
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,000
Whoa! What d'you
think you're doing?

489
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,375
Out of my way, Rusian!

490
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,416
I can't kill her with
you standing there!

491
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,458
[AKO screams]

492
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,791
[KYOH]
Ladies and Gentleman,

493
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,166
I present to you the new faculty
advisor for our Net Game Club.

494
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,666
Welcome, Ms. Saito!

495
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,708
[SAITO] After Miss Goshoin's
threat, I mean, invitation,

496
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,833
I had no choice, but
now I've come on board

497
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,583
as your new club's
faculty sponsor.

498
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,958
Don't you mean our "myew"
club's faculty sponsor?

499
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,083
Yes, of course. Oh, the fun.

500
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,291
Brutal.

501
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,958
Well, we couldn't let
our nice, new club

502
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,791
have such an inglorious ending.

503
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,833
[AKO grumbles]

504
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,875
She'd better keep
away from my Rusian.

505
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,208
Yeah, I mean you, meow-face!

506
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,333
You need to stop and think
about what you've done.

507
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,916
You're lucky this didn't blow up
into something more serious.

508
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,583
At least Nekohime
wasn't an old man.

509
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,875
All right, you guys!

510
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,125
Since it's come to this,

511
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,291
I will work hard as your
club's faculty advisor!

512
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,416
However, I do have one request.

513
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,416
Which is?

514
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,833
Every single member of the club

515
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,916
must attend school as often
as their health allows.

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,666
Right, Tamaki?

517
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,000
[AKO groans]

518
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,750
[HIDEKI growls]

519
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,541
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

520
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,541
Very well.

521
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,916
That's done.

522
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,333
Now we can all start playing
the game together again!

523
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,083
[AKO gasps]

524
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,125
Yeah! I can't wait!

525
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh yeah, that reminds me!

526
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,583
You need to come by the house

527
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,625
and meet my parents
sometime soon!

528
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,791
I am not doing that!

529
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,166
[gasps]

530
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,833
So then, you want me
to come to your house

531
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,083
to meet your parents first?

532
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,208
No, I told you.

533
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,750
The game and reality are
two different things!

534
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,041
[SAITO]
Now it's time for your lecture.

535
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,833
If it had been anyone but me,
this could've ended terribly.

536
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,625
I mean, attacking someone
you've never met?

537
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,875
[AKO]
It was a myewstake!

538
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,958
[SAITO]
How dare myew mock me!
