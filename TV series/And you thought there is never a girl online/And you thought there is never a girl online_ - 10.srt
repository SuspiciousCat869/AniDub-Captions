1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,125
[RUSIAN] A long time ago,
I was playing in a pickup party.

2
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,666
[LEADER] Is one healer gonna
be enough for this instance?

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,208
We'll be fine!

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,500
[RUSIAN] I, personally, didn't
think we were gonna be fine.

5
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,916
[RUSIAN] Sure enough, her
healing rate couldn't keep up

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,166
and we were party wiped.

7
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,208
Isana kept apologizing to us,

8
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,458
but it wasn't really
her fault at all.

9
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,666
I should have said something
from the beginning,

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,541
before the disaster.

11
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,083
I started worrying that
she would eventually

12
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,083
get fed up with the game,
and quit outright.

13
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,833
Then, a few months later,

14
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,458
she was there in
another pickup party.

15
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,166
Same as ever.

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,500
You think one healer's
gonna be enough?

17
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,416
I'll be just fine.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,875
[RUSIAN]
But after what happened before,

19
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,291
I couldn't just sit back
and say nothing.

20
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,166
This will be tough
with just one healer.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,416
So let's make sure
to take our time.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,958
[RUSIAN] And then Isana sent me
a message in private chat.

23
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,000
It was quick and to the point.

24
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,750
Thanks a lot.

25
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,416
So are you just trying to
brag about your ex-girlfriend?

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,291
She wasn't my girlfriend!

27
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,041
Did I get it wrong?

28
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,916
The point of the story
is that certain people

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,375
don't really know
how to ask for help

30
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,875
and that can lead to problems.

31
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,500
You understand that, right?

32
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,083
[AKO]
Yes. I understand.

33
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,833
I think sometimes people
fell overburdened.

34
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,333
And with a little
bit of empathy,

35
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,750
you can help them get past
whatever's slowing them down.

36
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,208
[AKO]
Yes, I see.

37
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,291
That's great!

38
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,625
Did any of that
help you understand

39
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,875
how I've been feeling?

40
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,291
What's that?

41
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,625
Summer vacation
will be over soon

42
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,958
and we'll all have
to go back to school.

43
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,125
I was just hoping that I could
get you to tell everyone

44
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,000
that you and I aren't
actually married.

45
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,291
We're just in a relationship.

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,708
There you go again,
you silly man.

47
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,750
Oh, Rusian, that was rich!
But all that build up...

48
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,541
That was an actual request,
not some joke.

49
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,541
[HIDEKI] Man, I wish I could buy
a heat resistance potion

50
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,541
right about now.

51
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,416
It's hotter than
an oven's armpit.

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,750
Yeah, it is. That's quite
the tan you've got there.

53
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,083
Thanks. But it's nice to see
you as pasty white as ever.

54
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,250
Gee, thanks.

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,625
[AKANE]
Nishimura.

56
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,000
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

57
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,583
I need a moment of your time.

58
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,333
[HIDEKI]
Um, Segawa?

59
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,041
Would you just come
with me already?

60
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,125
[HIDEKI]
Ow! My neck!

61
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,208
Now Segawa's dragging
Nishimura out of class.

62
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,750
I think it's safe to say that
summer break is officially over.

63
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,333
[BOTH]
Oh yeah.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,625
[HIDEKI] Just because we haven't
seen each other in a while,

65
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,875
doesn't mean you can do that!

66
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,375
We hung out yesterday
afternoon in the game.

67
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,541
Yeah. Guess you're right.

68
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,625
It seems like something's
bothering you.

69
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,750
Ugh! Forced conversation
with classmates

70
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,916
to ask what they did over
the summer's so cliché.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,291
In some ways, it's worse
than coming back to school.

72
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,458
Plus it all sounds
like suck-ware

73
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,875
with un-skippable cut scenes!

74
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,875
Oh really?
Well that's unfortunate.

75
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,541
I spent so much of last term

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,000
trying to come across as
a regular high school girl.

77
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,083
To be honest, I'm not even
sure I still know how.

78
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,958
[HIDEKI] I thought it was
your character class.

79
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,208
[NANAKO]
Akane! Good morning!

80
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,625
What are you two up to,
alone on the stairs? An affair?

81
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,708
Please don't say that.

82
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,458
If Ako heard, her brain
might explode.

83
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,291
We were just having
a little chat!

84
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,291
You could try to be
friendly in class.

85
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,875
You wouldn't have to slink
away to have a conversation.

86
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,250
[AKANE]
Butt out, would you?

87
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,500
It's not a team-killing
summoner's business anyhow.

88
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,916
You can talk to me
after you've abandoned

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,833
your precious Mu-Tan
in the mountains.

90
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,375
My puppy in the game?!
That's horrible!

91
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,125
Mu-tan's a good boy!
What'd he ever do wrong?

92
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,208
[ALL chuckling]

93
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,708
[AKANE]
He runs around out of control.

94
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,541
[HIDEKI]
Mm-hm.

95
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,000
[SETTE]
Mu-tan, bad boy!

96
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,833
[AKANE] Then the little
mongrel pulls enemies.

97
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:38,958
[HIDEKI]
That's true.

98
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,833
"Mu-tan, bad boy!"
That doesn't cut it!

99
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,708
Wow! You guys are such meanies!

100
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,000
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Ako yet.

101
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,583
Same here.

102
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,666
I'd like to go and mess with her
a bit to make me feel better.

103
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,583
[HIDEKI] Speak of the devil.
Ako's calling.

104
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,125
[AKO] Hello, Rusian!
Good morning, dear!

105
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,166
Why haven't you or Schew
or Master logged in yet?

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,583
--[HIDEKI gasps]
--[AKANE groans]

107
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,500
Come on. Seriously?

108
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,125
What's wrong?

109
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,208
[KYOH]
Good morning! Welcome.

110
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,250
I hope everyone
had a great break.

111
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,458
And though it may have flown by,

112
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,375
I'm sure you all found
your time away

113
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,750
as productive and
memorable as I did.

114
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,708
It is also my hope
that during this new...

115
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll try to just sneak in late.

116
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,291
[AKO]
Rusian...

117
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,875
Hey, I'm proud.

118
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,416
You resisted the urge to stay
at home and skip school today.

119
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,416
Well you did say how much
you were looking forward

120
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,791
to seeing my beautiful
face at school again.

121
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,875
Oh great. I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

122
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,125
[SAITO]
All right, everyone!

123
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,916
Today we embark
upon the adventure

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,750
that is the longest term
of the school year!

125
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,791
Now who's ready to learn?

126
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,791
Ahh... So nice and cool.

127
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,583
Oh yeah.

128
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,083
Did you miss me as much
as I missed you, War Machine?

129
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:06,166
So hey, how much of your stolen
gear did you manage to recover?

130
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,500
[HIDEKI] Uhh... Dunno.
Twenty percent-ish?

131
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,291
You've still got
a long way to go.

132
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,375
I know my Rusian.

133
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,250
Simply reassembling his old
set won't be good enough.

134
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,916
I bet you're going to try
to get better gear

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,375
than you had before!

136
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,583
Huh?! Is that really your plan?!

137
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,250
Curse you, and your
stinkin' female intuition.

138
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,916
[AKANE] Who the hell
do you think you are?!

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,375
Hear me out before you freak!

140
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,166
Y'know how sometimes
after you make your setup,

141
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,500
you have buyer's remorse?

142
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,708
Like wishing you'd chosen
different enchantments

143
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,041
or realizing that set
bonus wasn't worth it?

144
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,416
I'm talking 'bout
min max city, baby!

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,791
What you had was fine,

146
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,791
so just buy it again so you
can finally be useful!

147
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,708
Uh! Right! Yes, ma'am!

148
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,625
Eyes front!

149
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,083
Tell me. What do you think of
when you hear "second term"?

150
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,541
Well, there's rewards from
the summer events to distribute.

151
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,333
Collecting pumpkins for the
Halloween special event?

152
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,916
The bevy of new items coming
out with the fall update.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,083
Quantities are limited.

154
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,291
And then the Christmas
event with Rusian!

155
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,750
I didn't mean that!

156
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,958
I meant the second term at
school, not in the game!

157
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,500
I feel like we're
forgetting something big.

158
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,041
When you think September,

159
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,375
you think Maegasaki's culture
festival, Sakikosai!

160
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,250
[AKANE, HIDEKI, AKO]
Oh.

161
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,666
C'mon, guys. It's a big deal.

162
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,625
Can't you at least pretend
to be more fired up?

163
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,333
Are you positive you're
high school students?

164
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,500
[KYOH]
All right.

165
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,125
While the whole thing
may be a nuisance,

166
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,541
it's a nuisance we
simply can't ignore.

167
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,291
It's supposed to be fun.

168
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,666
Since our club has
actual activities,

169
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,291
we have to take part.

170
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,791
Yeah, I get it. But what
are we supposed to do?

171
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,208
The easy answer is to show off

172
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,666
the results achieved
by our club.

173
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,166
What results? What've we
done besides game?

174
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,166
We got Ako to come to school.

175
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,833
[AKO]
Ta-da!

176
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,250
[AKANE]
That's it?

177
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,166
Ako's gonna be our
main attraction?

178
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,416
You mean like some sort
of science experiment?

179
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,458
I couldn't take such
an unorthodox display!

180
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,750
Any net gamer worth his salt

181
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,041
knows you can't spell
"exposed" without "dox".

182
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,000
So really, all joking aside,

183
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,500
we just need to come up with
some result and present it.

184
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,916
Yeah, but what?

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,291
If you have no ideas...
then I have a prime proposal!

186
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,666
Siege warfare?

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,666
Wait. You mean like
the recent PvP update?

188
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
Yes, siege warfare,

189
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,125
the long awaited expansion
content recently released.

190
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,458
It's perfect!

191
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,750
What if we make the winner
of that our exhibition?

192
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,208
Yeah, maybe, but
siege warfare is, y'know--

193
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,916
the large-scale, guild-on-guild,

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,500
PvP battle they
hold once a week.

195
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,875
That's your suggestion?

196
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,958
Yes. All club members will
compete for shared glory.

197
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,375
An elegant solution.

198
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,708
Yeah, I guess so.

199
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,583
Let's say we're able
to pull it off.

200
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,166
How do we present it for
the school festival?

201
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,041
Whoever wins siege warfare

202
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,458
becomes lords of the
castle for a week.

203
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,291
The guild's emblem is then
hoisted proudly over the castle.

204
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,125
So do we even have
an emblem to raise?

205
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,333
[KYOH chuckles]

206
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,875
Okay.

207
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,541
So we take the school crest
as our emblem, and raise that.

208
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,416
Is that what you were going for?

209
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,916
Indeed!

210
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,208
And we all take a commemorative
screen cap in front of it!

211
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,625
Then we can use that picture
as our display panel.

212
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,375
[chuckles nervously]

213
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,500
[AKO] Siege warfare, huh?
I don't know.

214
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,041
I'm not too wild about
the whole idea.

215
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,083
What, you don't
like PvP fighting?

216
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,625
I just know I'm not gonna win.

217
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,375
You seem pretty
cheerful, considering.

218
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,916
[AKO] I'll admit, I'm not
excited about this term

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,750
or going to school every day,

220
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,083
but at least at the end I get
to walk home with you,

221
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,750
my darling Rusian.

222
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,958
Yeah. It is nice.

223
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,500
I was wondering.

224
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,833
What's your class doing for the
festival, Ako? Do you know?

225
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,333
Oh, well, um...

226
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,666
We're doing a presentation
on the shops near school

227
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,500
that sell delicious food.

228
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,666
Wow, that actually
sounds pretty fun.

229
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,083
Yeah, I guess so.

230
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,041
Don't just stand there
looking tensely at each other!

231
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,041
Start fighting, already!

232
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,875
But I-- I don't have it in me

233
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,041
to attack poor Rusian
for no reason.

234
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,416
You have a reason.
It's called PvP practice!

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,666
Staring into each other's eyes

236
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,791
like a love-struck
couple isn't training.

237
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,291
We weren't, Master!

238
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,208
It's just that my current setup
doesn't have enough power

239
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,750
to take Ako in one shot,

240
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,625
so I was planning to
whittle her down first

241
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,416
with a taste of reflect damage.

242
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,208
Yeah, yeah. Go on.
Get to work, Ako!

243
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,916
Um, okay. Fine.

244
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,250
Ah! Oh no!

245
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,500
Ako!

246
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,708
Are you all right?

247
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,916
My attack bounced back
and hit me instead!

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,458
Go ahead and heal
yourself, okay?

249
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,083
Of course! Thanks again
for helping me out!

250
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,458
[RUSIAN]
Don't mention it.

251
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,041
[AKO]
My hero!

252
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,583
[RUSIAN]
Just doin' my thing.

253
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,458
That's it! Here I come, chump!

254
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,583
Extra Damage Buff!

255
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,291
Ho-ho! Not too shabby,
you guys.

256
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,250
One hit knocked her
into the red.

257
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,833
What was that? It was like
being hit by a train.

258
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,041
My bad. Force of habit.

259
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,500
The first attack he used
causes a stun effect.

260
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,125
He likes it when I cast
Extra Damage after that.

261
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,416
I never realized your
shield stun was so effective!

262
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,125
Well, stun moves in general
are pretty versatile.

263
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,500
But the down side
to that ability

264
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,541
is a long cool down time.

265
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,208
Whatever it was,
it's got me fired up!

266
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:58,958
Wonderful. Now it's my turn
to go head-to-head with you.

267
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,708
[AKANE]
You ready?

268
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,666
Let's roll, Master!

269
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,083
[KYOH] Abandon hope...
as I unleash my grand spell!

270
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,833
But that's Master's
finishing move!

271
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,541
That's how she's
starting the fight?

272
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,375
Meteor!

273
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,500
Did you really think I
would sit around and wait

274
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,625
for such an obvious
AoE attack?

275
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,125
You weren't in range of my
flaming maelstrom of carnage?

276
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,291
But how? Mobs always are!

277
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,208
This bad mamma-jamma
ain't no mob!

278
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,333
[growls]

279
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,916
How did you do that?

280
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,583
[KYOH]
Impossible. How could I lose?

281
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,375
[AKO]
I'll resurrect you. Hold on.

282
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,625
[KYOH]
You're next, Rusian! Let's go!

283
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,041
[KYOH]
Wait! I can't move!

284
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,041
Impossible.

285
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,583
[AKO]
I'll resurrect you.

286
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,291
All right, Ako!

287
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,875
Let's see how you fare
against... my meteor spell!

288
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,208
I'm as good as dead for sure!

289
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,291
You're fine. Just chill
and blast an SS.

290
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,333
[AKO]
O-Okay. Skill Sealing Spell!

291
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,250
[AKO]
Master!

292
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,750
Brace yourself!

293
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,208
[KYOH whines]

294
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,250
[AKO]
I'll just, uh, resurrect you.

295
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,625
[KYOH]
But how?

296
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,916
My attack power and defense
rating are way higher

297
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,708
than any of the other members
of Guild Alley Cats.

298
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,875
Well, Schew knows her
melee fighter role well,

299
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,083
she's our PvP ace.

300
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,625
Magic users who go toe-to-toe
with her typically lose.

301
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,000
[chuckles]

302
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,208
As a tank, I have specialized
stun lock attacks

303
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,833
that stop spell casting.

304
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,291
And Ako.

305
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,750
She actually distributed
her stats pretty evenly.

306
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,000
She's ready for PvP play.

307
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,958
Whatever I did
was unintentional!

308
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,125
Frankly, Master,
a magic user like you

309
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,083
shouldn't be trying to
duel in the first place.

310
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,541
No, you're wrong.

311
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,500
I've seen videos where
magic users like me

312
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,125
singlehandedly wiped the
floor with their opponents!

313
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,541
But PvP play requires
its own kind of equipment

314
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,208
and a new approach to fighting.

315
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,458
Go ahead, Rusian! Say it.

316
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,000
Say that we're just a rag-tag
group of broken down characters

317
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,791
with a snowball's chance
in hell of ever taking out

318
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,541
enough players to win
the siege warfare event!

319
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,583
Pretty much.

320
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,916
[gasps]

321
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,041
[KYOH]
I never expected this.

322
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,750
I conducted a little research,

323
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,333
and I realized that Apricot
is not suited to PvP.

324
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,083
It would be quicker to
build a new character

325
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,416
from the ground up.

326
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,083
I tried sparring with
some of my friends

327
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,291
who've been playing
PvP for a while.

328
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,666
They wiped the floor with me.

329
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,416
I've played my fair
share of PvP matches,

330
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
but my current equipment
isn't top-tier.

331
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,000
A quick question.

332
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,958
How many siege battles are there
before the culture festival?

333
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,500
[HIDEKI]
They're held every Sunday,

334
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,041
so we've got three more.

335
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,000
Is it even possible?

336
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,333
[HIDEKI]
Well, worst case scenario,

337
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,583
we change our
festival presentation.

338
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,583
We could always do something

339
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,333
like a net game
discussion panel.

340
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,041
There's no way you're going to
get me in that discussion panel!

341
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,333
Speaking as the student
council president,

342
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,916
I can't do it either.

343
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,583
I'm okay with just staying here
and playing games with Rusian

344
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,541
for the entire afternoon.

345
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,208
Yeah, we should at least
get out and look around.

346
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,375
Right, we might as well
give it our best shot.

347
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,458
Everyone, get your gear ready.

348
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,583
We shall take part in
the next siege battle!

349
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,166
This will be the Alley
Cat's first campaign.

350
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
Let's stick together.

351
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,083
Of course we start off with the
Templar Fortress of Ray Sword.

352
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,875
The group that currently
holds the castle

353
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,000
are a guild known as
the Cleaning Crew.

354
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,375
[AKANE]
They can't be serious.

355
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,375
How cute! A guild of maids!

356
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,750
No.

357
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,875
If they're holding the fort,
they've gotta be tough.

358
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,458
Rusian's right.
We must be careful.

359
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,708
Otherwise, they'll end up
mopping the floor with us.

360
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,750
[ANNOUNCER]
Siege warfare will now commence.

361
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:10,208
[KYOH] Is everyone ready?
Be not too eager, nor too timid.

362
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,375
Onward!

363
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,083
All right!

364
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,958
Let's do this!

365
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,500
Looks like another guild
is gonna try first.

366
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:24,791
Yes. Let's watch them,
and analyze how they fight.

367
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,750
[AKANE]
That entire raiding party...

368
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,708
...wiped out in less
than ten seconds!

369
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,958
Brutal.

370
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,291
Let's go back!

371
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,375
No. We won't know how bad
it is unless we do it.

372
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,166
Onward!

373
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,000
But I don't wanna!

374
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,208
There are no death
penalties in siege warfare.

375
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,791
Let's give that
attack another shot!

376
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,083
I don't wanna go
there anymore!

377
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,875
I'm sorry about that!
Excuse me, sir!

378
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,375
What's the big idea?

379
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,041
Hey, that's my wife, you jerk!

380
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,333
You want a fight?
Well you got one!

381
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,916
Hold on!
We're badly outnumbered!

382
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,833
So that's it.
There's a single enemy,

383
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,458
but the forces arrayed against
them aren't a solid front.

384
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,583
Everyone laying
siege is a rival.

385
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,875
This sounds impossible.

386
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,208
[KYOH] Apparently, to break up a
deadlock like we've been facing,

387
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,500
we can gather together materials
and build our own siege weapons.

388
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,916
What?

389
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,958
We can bust down the walls
and charge in the breach?

390
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,458
[KYOH] Yes. For example,
a giant catapult,

391
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,208
a.k.a. "Gi," can be controlled
by five players.

392
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,041
Not enough.

393
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,500
Hang on, don't give up
on me just yet.

394
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,583
[AKANE] Oh, what? You know
the victory conditions?

395
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,083
Master?

396
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,750
I'm breaking out
the premium items

397
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,583
that you guys forbid
me from using!

398
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,333
Under these circumstances,
it's our only real option!

399
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,708
No! Come back!

400
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,166
The siege warfare event
temporarily locks access

401
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,041
to premium items!

402
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,916
[KYOH]
You've got to be kidding me!

403
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,666
[KYOH] A Drop of Yggdrasil is
about the only non-premium means

404
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,291
of total recovery
I have in my pack.

405
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,500
I've never even owned
such a precious item,

406
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,750
much less used it.

407
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,625
One of those is worth
about ten megas.

408
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,750
Selling it at the bazaar
and upgrading your gear

409
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,958
would be more practical.

410
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,500
[KYOH]
I can't accept this.

411
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,333
This could possibly be
the perfect opportunity

412
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,166
to wean Master off premium
items once and for all.

413
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,750
Good idea.

414
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,541
Wait, is that?

415
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,875
[CLOUD] Proud and noble warriors
of our lady's Elite Guard!

416
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,375
Hear me!

417
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,500
We have one goal! And that goal
is to take this fortress!

418
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,958
In the name of
our goddess, Nekohime!

[ELITE GAURD yelling]

420
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,541
Stop, you guys! Wait!

421
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,500
I never asked you
to do this for me!

422
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,666
Ms. Saito's guild is
pretty powerful, isn't it?

423
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,500
Nekohime's Elite Guard.

424
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,333
These dudes seem to be
experts at the game.

425
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,791
Hey. They occupied the fortress.

426
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,083
They sure did.

427
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,375
Huh.

428
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,583
We might as well go.

429
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,791
[RUSIAN]
Sometime after,

430
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,750
though Nekohime's guard
put up a good fight,

431
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,333
they were beaten
by a larger guild,

432
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,625
and chased off
the lord's throne.

433
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,791
"Death or glory in
Nekohime's name."

00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,208
"For our lady's honor!"

435
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,875
"The holy cat-girl angel!"

436
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,833
"We devote our very
beings to her!"

00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,791
[NEKOHIME crying]

438
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,416
[NEKOHIME]
It's not like that!

439
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,750
I was just chit-chatting
about the siege event,

440
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,250
and before I mew it,
all hell broke loose!

441
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,833
[NANAKO]
Listen up, everyone.

442
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,541
We can't just have wholesale
copying of the sources.

443
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,875
Rework the sentences to make
them sound like your own.

444
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,125
[ALL]
Roger that!

445
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,583
But tracing the school
map is still acceptable.

446
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,916
All of our sources come from
books in the library or the web.

447
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,916
Are you sure we've
got enough research?

448
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,875
I don't think the
bibliography is as important

449
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,875
as our level of presentation.

450
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,208
Which is exactly why I'm
questioning this method.

451
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,875
Being a teacher
isn't easy, meow.

452
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,375
Neither is finding a good excuse
to make cat noises apparently.

453
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,416
[AKO] No way on earth
I'm letting that happen.

454
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,666
Ako?

455
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,958
[AKO] It's our dumb
class presentation.

456
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,875
[HIDEKI] An exhibit of the tasty
foods around Maegasaki, right?

457
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,166
Originally, but
now it's changed.

458
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,083
Someone suggested that since
we were already doing

459
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,166
a presentation on food,
why not have something

460
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,208
the attendees could
actually snack on?

461
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,791
Sounds like an improvement.

462
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,250
Then they started suggesting

463
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,166
that we could raise a little
money by selling the food,

464
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,333
and even more money if
we have the girls in class

465
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,583
wait on the guests
who want a bite to eat.

466
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,000
Starting to come off the rails.

467
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,208
[AKO]
Right?!

468
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,625
Then they said,
if we're going to do a café,

469
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,291
why not make it a maid café?

470
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,875
That's veering way off course!

471
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,333
But you haven't even
heard the worst part!

472
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,541
They started saying,

473
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,208
"Tamaki knows all about
maids, doesn't she?

474
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,125
Let's make her
the head maid!"

475
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,500
Then they put me in charge
of the whole thing!

476
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,583
Well, I get why
they chose you.

477
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,041
[AKANE]
There's a common misconception

478
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,666
normies have that
otaku equals maid.

479
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,250
But every single one
of them is wrong.

480
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm a devoted housewife,
not some stupid old maid!

481
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,666
You're not actually a housewife.

482
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,000
[AKO]
And that's not all!

483
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,125
They asked me to get the
uniforms, draw up shifts,

484
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,500
come up with a serving manual.

485
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,541
I don't know anything
about that stuff!

486
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,875
Yeah, picking you probably
wasn't the best choice.

487
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,291
Well, as far as
the uniforms go,

488
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,333
I'm sure Master could probably
track some down for you.

489
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,416
Oh yeah. I guess you're right.

490
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,583
Cool. Best of luck with that.

491
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,041
We'll help out however
we possibly can.

492
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,708
Okay.

493
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,208
Top ten reasons
you're glad I'm here!

494
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,250
Lame!

495
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,541
But number seven
will shock you.

496
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,708
Wait. What are you
doing here, Nanako?

497
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,083
Yeah, what's a total newb
scrub doing in our club?

498
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,125
I asked her to join us.

499
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,916
We need as many allies
as we can get, don't we?

500
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,041
That said, I ordered
a couple extra computers

501
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,083
for Sette and Ms. Saito.

502
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,083
Listen, Nanako, you don't have
to go through the trouble

503
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,500
of trying to help us out.

504
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:20,291
Whatever, it sounds like fun!
I just hope I can help!

505
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,875
Are you willing to come up
here on Sundays to work?

506
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,000
I wish you all shared
the same enthusiasm

507
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,333
for the class presentation.

508
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,625
[SETTE]
Awww. I'm sorry, Mu-tan.

509
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,625
But you have to stay
behind this time.

510
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,958
You cause too much
trouble for us

511
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,250
nipping at everyone and
their brother's heels.

512
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,708
Now, time for strategy.

513
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,916
Today, we're going
after Fort Cantor,

514
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,125
the smallest castle
in the siege event.

515
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,916
The occupying guild
is small like us.

516
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,375
Emperor Sword.

517
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,083
They're made up of
about 20 players.

518
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,875
Uh. But we've only got six
people fighting for us.

519
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,166
That's a pretty
steep disadvantage.

520
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,291
We'll all get killed off again!

521
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,916
Don't worry. I've come up
with a plan this time.

522
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,833
So you've got a trick
up your sleeve?

523
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,833
Yes.

524
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,541
I've lined up some
reinforcements

525
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:12,250
from the server's top class
powerhouse mercenary outfit.

526
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,416
Wallenstein's agreed to help.

527
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,541
Did mew say Wallenstein?

528
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,125
I knew she'd solve
the problem with money.

529
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,916
You've heard of these guys?

530
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,333
Yeah.

531
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,708
[AKANE]
Please, don't die, Master.

532
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:33,875
If you kick the bucket here,

533
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,583
what're we gonna do
about the festival?

534
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,208
We'll be totally lost
without you!

535
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,000
[HIDEKI] Next time:
"The Death of Apricot."

536
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,000
