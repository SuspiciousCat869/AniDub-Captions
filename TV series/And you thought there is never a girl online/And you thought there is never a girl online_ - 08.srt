1
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,375
[HIDEKI]
Gimme a break.

2
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,291
This is her idea of
alone time in a hotel?

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,875
No way. It dropped me?

4
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,375
I guess these things
happen sometimes.

5
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,083
Well, at least it wasn't right
in the middle of combat.

6
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,750
Oh, man!

7
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,583
[HIDEKI]
Towel, towel.

8
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,833
I must've typed it in wrong.

9
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,291
[KYOH] Lately, some
net games, <i>LA</i> included,

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,250
have been rife with
account hacking.

11
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,250
Make sure to log off your
account before leaving.

12
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,750
[HIDEKI]
Don't tell me. I've been hacked?

13
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:42,750
Then that means...
the hacker must've logged in...

14
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,791
...and is playing Rusian!

15
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,333
[HIDEKI] Ako! That's an
impostor! He's not me!

16
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,875
C'mon! C'mon! Ako!

17
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,750
Rusian.

18
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,875
Rusian!

19
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,708
I'm sorry.
That must've been awful.

20
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,666
It's all okay now.

21
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,125
I'm gonna take a look
at your chat log, okay?

22
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,916
[gasps]

23
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,791
Rusian?

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,208
So, uh, what were you saying?

25
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,416
It's finally our chance. The two
of us alone together at last.

26
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,708
Well I was thinking
maybe we could

27
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,000
engage in a little
couple's chat?

28
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:24,875
[FAKE RUSIAN]
Hmm...

29
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,625
Couple? Huh.

30
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,291
'Course.
Because we're married.

31
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,833
Duh. I swear, you can
be so silly sometimes.

32
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,583
I remember everything,
the ceremony,

33
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,500
and the stained-glass
windows of the church

34
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,583
glimmering in the sunlight.

35
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,208
Whenever I think of
that day, even now,

36
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,125
my heart swells to bursting
with absolute rapture!

37
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:52,666
[FAKE RUSIAN] Oh man, you're
already good to go, aren'tcha?

38
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,791
Why don't we get
this party started?

39
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,458
Huh? Like how do you mean?

40
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,041
Like in that whole
"couple's chat" thing

41
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,708
you were just blabbing
to me about.

42
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,083
Oh, that.

43
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,833
Wow, you're being unusually
assertive, aren't you?

44
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:08,041
But you like it, don't you?
And you like me, right?

45
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,791
[AKO]
Uh. Umm... Well, I--

46
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,041
Stop it. You aren't Rusian.

47
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,458
[FAKE RUSIAN] 'Course I am.
Do I look any different?

48
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,750
No, but... you're not.

49
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey, what's the big deal, baby?

50
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,375
Now how 'bout you send me a
nice pic before we get started?

51
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,708
Something real sexy
to help me out on my end.

52
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,125
And don't worry. It's not
a problem if you're kinda dumpy.

53
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,708
I know chicks who play
MMO's are all nerdy losers,

54
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,625
but that won't slow me down.

55
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,958
Please stop it!

56
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't say things like
that using Rusian's face!

57
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,541
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

58
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,083
I am Rusian, babe.

59
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,708
The man I married would
never talk like that!

60
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,500
I know that you're
not really my man!

61
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,125
[AKO]
Rusian? I'm sorry.

62
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,750
What do you mean you're sorry?

63
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,958
There isn't anything that you
need to apologize for, Ako.

64
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,291
Sadly, this stuff happens
from time to time.

65
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,666
Especially in
browser-based games.

66
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,208
Getting pressured
into nasty chat

67
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,291
by some stupid hook-up troll?
You're the victim here.

68
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,583
You haven't done anything wrong.

69
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,625
In fact, if anyone's
to blame, it's me.

70
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,958
I was careless enough
to let it happen.

71
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,125
But still. Sorry.

72
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,625
It's fine. No need to apologize.

73
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,166
But I--

74
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,958
I made a mistake, and called
a complete stranger "Rusian."

75
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,833
And there, for the
briefest moment...

76
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,083
...I thought he was you.

77
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,250
[KYOH]
I tried to be careful.

78
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,750
I can't believe we actually
had an account hacked.

79
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,916
You can't just shrug it off

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,916
when it happens to
someone close to you.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,458
We logged into a secure site
on a PC anyone could use.

82
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,708
We should've been more cautious
when using a public computer.

83
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,166
I'm sorry. It's my
fault we're even here.

84
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,208
What're you talking about?
You're not to blame, Master.

85
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,708
First things first.

86
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,041
I'll contact the management
and tell them what happened.

87
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,708
[HIDEKI]
Yeah, good call.

88
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,875
Okay, so what do we do next?

89
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,750
Well, I've already
had my password reset

90
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,500
and regained account access.

91
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,875
[KYOH] You think your
information was stolen

92
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,333
from the lobby PC?

93
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,208
It's the only option that
really makes any sense.

94
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,541
I see.

95
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,125
So the first time it didn't
take your password,

96
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,125
it wasn't because
you mistyped it.

97
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,250
[HIDEKI]
Right.

98
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,333
Huh? What's that mean?

99
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,875
The tab was already open
on the lobby computer,

100
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,166
but it was a fake login page

101
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,125
that looked just
like the real one.

102
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,625
And when I tried to sign on,

103
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,083
it captured both
my ID and password.

104
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,291
Then it forwarded me on to the
<i>Legendary Age</i> official website.

105
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,291
That's a classic phishing scam.

106
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,958
So, how bad's the damage?

107
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,375
[HIDEKI]
Take a look for yourself.

108
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,791
Rusian's been totally erased.

109
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,500
Rusian...

110
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,541
[HIDEKI]
Hey now, take it easy.

111
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,583
It's not like I really
disappeared, you know.

112
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,458
But he took my Rusian away.
My Rusian is gone forever.

113
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,625
Actually, he's mine. My Rusian.

114
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,333
There isn't much more
that we can do,

115
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,500
so I'll make a new character.

116
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,083
But more importantly,

117
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,875
I have to start looking for the
things I can't ever get back.

118
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,208
Like the items
Rusian was carrying.

119
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,791
He clued in on what was coming.

120
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,375
'Cause when I tried to recover
my items right away,

121
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,958
a bunch of 'em
were already gone.

122
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,791
This guy really works fast.

123
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,666
Which makes this a contest
of speed for me too.

124
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,041
I'm guessing he probably sold
everything of value off.

125
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,916
I'll have to buy back
whatever I can.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,708
[AKANE] You're actually gonna
pay the guy who conned you?

127
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,791
I don't much like it, but some
items had sentimental value.

128
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,166
I want them back.

129
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,500
Understood.

130
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,625
I'll go scout out the shops
and auction houses.

131
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,708
Don't you worry.
I'll drum up some help.

132
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,833
I know some people
who can lend us a hand.

133
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,041
Time to get started.

134
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,666
Everyone use the
PCs in their rooms,

135
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,166
and let's find the stolen items.

136
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,375
So what are you going to do now?

137
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,958
Consult with an old friend.

138
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,416
He's got a ton of contacts
in the game community.

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,541
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
What dire news indeed.

140
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,750
Having your gear stolen

141
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,458
and your character
erased is most dreadful.

142
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,958
So now, I've been forced
to use this alt toon

143
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,208
that I made a long time ago.

144
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,666
That's why I'm showing up
in chat as Piroshiki.

145
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,291
But please just call me Rusian.

146
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,916
I've kinda gotten
used to that name.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,916
[BLACK MAGICIAN] I'll be frank.
You were careless.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,333
Try to be more
vigilant in the future.

149
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,125
The net can be quite a
dangerous place, after all.

150
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
I found that out the hard way.

151
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,166
And... this might
seem a bit forward.

152
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
I was hoping that maybe you'd
help me find my stolen stuff.

153
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,833
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
Sure, no problem.

154
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,500
[PIROSHIKI] Of course,
sorry to have bothered--

155
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,375
Uh? You're seriously
gonna help me?

156
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,958
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
Didn't I tell you before?

157
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,875
We're all fellow

All right then.
You heard her, boys!

163
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,125
In the name of
Nekohime's Elite Guard,

164
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,208
we will track down
the stolen items!

to help meow-ut,

is kinda unnecessary.

171
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,500
[KYOH] Well? Are any of
these items familiar?

172
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,875
[PIROSHIKI] Yes.
Now that you mention it,

173
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,666
I had one of each of these
items in my inventory.

174
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,458
[KYOH]
I see.

175
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,208
Let's take note of the
seller's name. Rontan.

176
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,125
So is this the jerk
that hacked me?

177
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,875
[KYOH]
It's a strong possibility.

178
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,166
I'll send a screencap of this
to the admins for evidence.

179
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,416
[PIROSHIKI]
I already did.

180
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,125
I can't believe how much
he's charging for these.

181
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,291
Don't worry about that.

182
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,750
I'd be glad to buy
them back for you.

183

No, you don't have to do that.

Yes I do.

I still feel partially
responsible

186

You've got mail!

190
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,250
It's from Cloud, one of
Nekohime's Elite Guards.

191
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,875
Oh wow! Look!

192
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,500
That's the wedding ring
I gave you, Rusian!

193
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,041
[HIDEKI] Apparently, he got
it as a drop from a monster.

194
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,291
It must've been thrown away
since he couldn't sell it.

195
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,583
The monster just picked it up.

196
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,000
[AKO] Thrown away?
That's just plain rude!

197
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,500
To say the very least!

198
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,041
But still, despite
him being a jerk,

199
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,291
our wedding ring
came back to us.

200
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,208
I'd call it a minor miracle.

201
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,666
Yeah, you're right.

202
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,875
This is the power of true
love at work online!

203
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,708
We were lucky.

204
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,166
[HIDEKI]
Maybe you're right.

205

[KYOH]
Okay then. Please excuse us.

206

Nishimura.

207
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,541
I know what happened must be
quite a shock to the system,

208
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,833
but try not to let it get
you down too much.

209
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,583
[KYOH]
The school is such a quiet place

210
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,541
during summer
vacation, isn't it?

211
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,791
[HIDEKI] Thanks for
coming up here with me

212
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,458
to explain what happened
to the administration.

213
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,625
[KYOH]
Not a problem.

214
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,833
It happened during
club camp, after all.

215
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,291
Stuff like this is part of
my job as club president.

216
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,375
[HIDEKI] I'm so outraged
by what happened.

217
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,916
Still, I can barely believe it.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,041
That makes sense.

219
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,708
You had your items stolen,

220
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,750
and the character you'd spent
so much time on was erased.

221
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,083
[HIDEKI]
Yeah, of course.

222
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,291
But what's worse,

223
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't stand the way
that he used Rusian

224
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,208
as a way to treat Ako like
she was a worthless nobody!

225
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,375
He took Rusian away from me.

226
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,625
And then, in the
blink of an eye,

227
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,041
he tried to steal
Ako's innocence!

228
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,666
That's one of
the problems online.

229
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,291
There are far too few
legitimate Nigerian princes.

230
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,166
And if you hijack an account,

231
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,458
it becomes all too easy to
pose as a different person.

232
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,000
The gaming world
is no exception.

233
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,916
It's sad to think the ties
we have to each other

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,291
are so fragile.

235
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,625
So easily corrupted.

236
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,791
[KYOH]
You think so?

237
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,625
Ako figured out
he wasn't really you

238
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,291
solely from the tone
of the chat dialogue.

239
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,916
If she knows it's an
impostor from just that,

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,375
it reinforces how deep your
relationship with Ako truly is.

241
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,083
That's why.

242
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,333
It's safe to say your ties
to her have stayed strong.

243
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,708
Looks like someone is
starting to cheer up a bit.

244
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,583
[HIDEKI]
Yeah.

245
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,208
You gave me a new perspective,

246
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,541
and now I wanna get this
bastard more than ever!

247
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,791
Oh yeah?

248
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,333
Because I was out for
blood from the get go.

249
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,916
Huh?

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,083
What do you mean, "The admins
aren't doing anything"?

251
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,416
And we've already found the guy

252
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,416
who's selling the
missing items as a set!

253
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,541
No ifs, ands or buts.
This Rontan guy's the culprit!

254
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,625
Whoever hacked me had
a different IP address

255
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,291
than the character we found
selling off my gear.

256
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,541
IP?

257
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,333
Yeah, that's right.

258
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,666
It's kinda like a personal
identification number

259
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,375
everyone who goes online
has assigned to them.

260
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,000
So if you do anything bad,

261
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,875
it can be used to track you
down, and bring you to justice.

262
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,708
And until we can identify
them as the same person,

263
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,166
we can't accuse them
of wrong-doing.

but when he's account hacking,
or other illegal stuff,

267
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,333
he uses a different IP.

supposed to take it?

00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,750
[HIDEKI]
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming!

314
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,541
[giggles]

315
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,291
I just dropped by--

316
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,625
Rusian, it's me,
your doting wife!

317
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,916
Geez, what was with
the harsh treatment?

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,125
I'm sorry. It was just a reflex.

319
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,916
I expected a significantly
warmer welcome.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,833
It is the first time your wife
has visited your family home.

321
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, technically speaking,
you're not my wife anymore.

322
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,375
Think about it. From the
moment Rusian was deleted,

323
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,458
it officially annulled
our marriage.

324
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,416
[gasps]

325
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,666
So we're divorced?!

326
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,125
Are you really just
now realizing that?

327
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,458
Rusian's disappearance
was such a shock.

328
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,458
I can't believe
he's really gone.

329
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,583
How could that phony Rusian
do something like this

330
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,208
to such a sweet, tender heart?!

331
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,833
What kind of maniac are
we dealing with here?

332
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,625
Glad you're all caught up.

333
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,166
Then that means...

334
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,041
If our marriage got annulled,
what does that make us?

335
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,916
Uh. Friends, I guess?

336
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,458
That can't be.

337
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,458
Um... if you and I aren't
a couple anymore...

338
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,083
...does that mean
you don't want this?

339
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,500
[HIDEKI]
Whoa!

340
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,666
[AKO] I don't really understand
what you've been up to

341
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,250
the last couple of days,

342
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,541
but I know that you've
been working extra hard.

343
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,416
I wanted to make
something for you.

344
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,125
I was wondering what I'd do for
lunch, and then you showed up!

345
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,666
Thanks, Ako!

346
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,875
Yeah, after I eat this, I'll be
ready for the home stretch!

347
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,916
Rusian, I'm proud of you
for working so hard,

348
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,958
but try not to overdo it.

349
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,416
Because the most
important thing to me

350
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,833
is making you happy.

351
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,333
Ako, of all the random,

352
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,500
sometimes inappropriate
things you've said to me,

353
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,791
that was the most wife-like.

354
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,750
[LON] "The Wannabe
Famous Swindler's Blog."

355
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,333
Get an email from someone

356
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,375
claiming to have found a blog
that's even better than mine,

357
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,291
so I take a peek to see
what all the fuss is about,

358
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,416

knock-off's all I find?

[NYACK] Greetings,
I am Game Master Nyack.

385
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,000
Tell me, do you know
why the two of you

386
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,208
were teleported to
this location?

387
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,333
The admins received a tip.

388
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,541
We were told you were engaging
in Real Money Transactions.

389
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,333
Is there any truth to this?

390
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,166
What do you mean?

391
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,166
Yes, that is accurate.

392
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,625
This person contacted
me on a trading board

393
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,750
and negotiated
an RMT with me.

394
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,250
Bastard! You set me up,
didn't you?

395
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,583
Haven't you ever heard that
turnabout is fair play?

396
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,958
So what?

397
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,500
Have we met before or somethin'?

398
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,875
None of this matters

399
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,208
because an RMT where no
money even exchanged hands

400
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,791
doesn't prove anything.

401
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,125
At most, we're looking at a
one week lockout, aren't we?

402
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,333
Not quite. One more thing.

403
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,208
You have been accused
of account hacking

404
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,333
via the character
known as Rontan.

405
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,916
Rontan? Who cares about him?

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,166
[NYACK] Based on the IP
information submitted to us

407
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,416
by the trading board,
we have proof.

408
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,791
You have committed several
access violations.

409
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,166
We are considering
filing charges.

410
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,250
You can't intimidate
me, Blondie!

411
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,708
There's no way a site that dirty

412
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,041
would ever hand any
IPs over to an admin!

413
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,208
Exactly what we wanted
you to think.

414
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,208
[SHOKO]
Huh?

415
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,708
[RUSIAN]
It was my website.

416
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,541
I put the whole thing
up three days ago.

417
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,166
Dude, are you kidding me?

418
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,291
That site has posts that go
back for a couple years!

419
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,166
[RUSIAN]
Oh man, you're tellin' me!

420
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,625
Fabricating a few years' worth
of authentic-sounding posts

421
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,875
really takes it outta ya!

422
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,041
No way. You're bluffing.

423
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,833
You faked multiple years
worth of blog material

424
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,833
just to set me up?

425
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,500
[RUSIAN]
Heh.

426
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,000
Are you some kinda idiot?

427
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,666
You wasted that much of your
time to trick one person?

428
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,083
Damn straight.

429
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,916
Besides... you made my wife cry.

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,291
You better believe I was
going to make you pay!

431
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,166
[AKO]
You guys made a fake blog?

432
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,583
Is that why you've
all been staying up

433
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,291
to work the last few nights?

434
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,625
Yeah. And watching the hacker.

435
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,125
We logged him replying to
the trade request from home,

436
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,708
unaware of our trap.

437
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,750
[AKANE] Then, he showed up for
the deal as the character Shoko.

438
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,125
[HIDEKI] Whenever he got up to
anything not entirely legal,

439
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,875
he was careful to use
a separate IP.

440
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,458
Including, of course,
when he hacked my account.

441
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,291
The admins have been proactive.

442
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,750
Rusian-- No, Piroshki's account

443
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,333
has been locked out
for three days,

444
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,541
suspended for an attempted RMT.

445
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,750
Yeah, but I was prepared for
a much stricter punishment.

446
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,000
[AKANE] You guys failed to
mention the very best part!

447
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,666
The admins also restored
Rusian's character!

448
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,041
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

449
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,708
[sighs] Nyack is
a total dreamboat.

450
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,500
So does that mean I
finally get to have

451
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,250
my dear Rusian back with me?

452
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,083
All's well that ends
well, right guys?

453
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:58,416
No. I'm afraid we still have
some unfinished business.

454
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,916
Ako, it's a bit late
to bring this up,

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,791
but when my account was hacked,
I was honestly shocked.

456
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,875
Having someone else logged in as
Rusian, I just felt so helpless,

457
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,541
so scared I would lose you too.

458
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,333
I don't ever wanna go through
something like that again.

459
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:57,166
I want-- I want to be closer
to you than I was before.

460
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,958
So, uh...

461
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,916
Would you like Rusian
a little less,

462
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,458
and try to like the real life
Hideki a little bit more?

463
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,958
I can't.

464
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,208
Sorry, I can't like you anymore.

465
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,958
Because I already love you
with all of my heart!

466
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,583
[KYOH] I came up with a
fool-proof anti-hacking measure.

467
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,750
[HIDEKI]
What is it?

468
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,583
[KYOH] We just buy
out the entire hotel!

469
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,625
