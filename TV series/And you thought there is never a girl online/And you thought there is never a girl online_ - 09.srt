1
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,625
It's freakin' huge!

2
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,416
I thought we were going
to your house.

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,166
This place looks like a museum.

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,666
Okay, I'm definitely out
of my element here.

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,500
Why'd you girls bring me
to this shiny palace?

6
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,000
Because you haven't touched any
of your vacation homework yet,

7
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,541
and now our summer
break is almost over!

8
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,833
In that case,
let's call Rusian too!

9
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,416
Things're better when
you work as a team!

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,791
I don't think our
parents would like it

11
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,833
if we invited a boy
to our sleepover.

12
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:04,000
Ugh. If Rusian can't be here,
why'd she have to come?

13
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:04,791
You called.

14
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,125
No I didn't! It wasn't me!

15
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,083
This is an opportunity for
you to learn to socialize

16
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,416
without using
Rusian as a safety net.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
You can't do any better than
Nanako to practice with.

18
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,291
You're trying to
get me to practice

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,458
by squaring off
against the final boss?

20
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,875
[AKANE] Try getting good, scrub.
Time to learn by dying.

21
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,875
I'm standing right
here, you know.

22
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,416
I know.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
[NANAKO chuckles]

24
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,375
Ready to work on
becoming friends, Ako?

25
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,875
[AKO]
Save me, Rusian!

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,458
[ALL] It's good to have you
back home, your ladyship.

27
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,916
Yes.

28
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,791
Now say hello to my
friends from school!

29
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,166
Take good care of them.

30
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,041
At long last, it's done.

31
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,708
Our beloved mistress has
finally made real friends.

32
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,458
We've dreamed of this
moment for so long,

33
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,250
and now it's actually
coming true!

34
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,333
Would you cut it out
with the water works?

35
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,375
No need to be
embarrassed, Master.

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,208
I'm proud of how
much you've grown.

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,625
I don't need your support pity!

38
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,333
Come on, let's go!

39
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,000
[AKO] I've never seen
a real maid before.

40
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,666
I thought they only
existed in stories.

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,708
Technically,
she's not a real maid.

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,333
Huh?

43
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,458
[MAID A chuckles]

44
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,791
When we learned the
mistress' friends

45
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,833
were coming for a visit,

46
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,541
we rush ordered the costumes.

47
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,625
[AKANE] What, so this
is just lousy cosplay?

48
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,791
What a terribly
rude thing to say!

49
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,625
That is a real-deal
maid's outfit,

50
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,125
totally accurate in material,
design, and practicality.

51
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,708
If you're interested,

52
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,333
I could have one made for each
of you ladies anytime you like.

53
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,833
Wow, you mean it?

54
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,666
Don't take the bait, you idiot.

55
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,500
[KYOH]
This is my room.

56
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:34,583
It's ten times bigger than mine.
It's almost as big as my house.

57
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,083
It's even got a side room!

58
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,208
What is that?

59
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,541
That is my personal
computer space.

60
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,250
[AKANE] You realize
you're not a day trader,

61
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,125
don't you, Cypher?

62
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,583
Just watch. I'll earn a
hundred million in seconds!

63
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,625
I wanna be you when I grow up!

64
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,083
I don't think you could even
a handle a dual-screen setup.

65
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,500
It's simple. I have a strategy
site open on this window.

66
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,625
Which means I can
quick reference...

67
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,125
Ah! I can't hear you! Stop it!

68
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,333
Well then. Should we
start our homework?

69
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,000
[groans]

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,458
I can't take it anymore!

71
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,541
How did you forget everything
we worked on last term?

72
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,291
Our vacation wasn't that long.

73
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,083
I left the flower of knowledge
untended for too long,

74
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,916
and now the poor thing
has withered away, Kupo!

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,375
Withered?

76
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,333
Master? Could you please
point me towards the restroom?

77
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Go out, take a left.
It's the fifth door.

78
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,833
If you'll excuse me.

79
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,166
[NANAKO]
I'm coming too!

80
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,333
That won't be necessary.

81
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,500
What won't be necessary?
I need to use the restroom.

82
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,083
Good idea. Go with her, Nanako.

83
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,625
If we leave her alone,
she might try to run home.

84
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,625
Who, me? I would never
try something like that!

85
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,458
No, I'm afraid you
can't be trusted.

86
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,291
[AKANE]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

87
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,833
There you have it! Shall we?

88
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,375
[AKO grumbles]

89
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,208
Time to head back.

90
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:29,208
Go on without me!
I'll reconnoiter the perimeter!

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,791
I don't think we should be
walking around on our own.

92
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,000
It's fine. My gamer sense is
trying to tell me something.

93
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,125
It's saying I need to
reveal the local map.

94
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,583
Then my hands are tied!

95
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,458
If I leave you alone,
you'll run away.

96
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,083
Guess I'll have
to stick with you.

97
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,125
No. I wouldn't run away.

98
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,083
Uh? What's that?

99
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,833
I'm starting to think
I shouldn't have let

100
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,083
the two of them go.

101
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,416
Schwein is just a pig

102
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,750
and doesn't comprehend
difficult social nuances.

103
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,666
Don't be so immature.

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,041
Besides, they're
polar opposites.

105
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
[AKANE]
Hmm...

106
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,250
You might be surprised
by how well those differences

107
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,666
can compliment each other.

108
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,083
Well, I guess it's worth a shot.

109
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,208
This looks like
the kind of place

110
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,375
that would be chock
full of hidden items!

111
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,583
If someone hid them,

112
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,125
they probably don't
want us to find them.

113

[gasps]

114

[AKO]
Hey, check it out!

115
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,583
That book looks like it's
rigged up to something.

116
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,375
This isn't a game, Ako.
Nothing's going to happen.

117
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,208
I told you there'd
be hidden loot!

[NANAKO screams]

119
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,541
Let's see what kind
of treasure you hold!

120
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:07,958
[NANAKO]
An album?

121
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,916

I guess so.

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,750
[MAID A]
I see you found it.

This is a true Goshoin
family treasure.

126
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,166
This album chronicles the growth
of young Mistress Kyoh.

127
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,666
We're so proud.

128
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,875
Wait, why did you have it
hidden away in a secret room?

129
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,416
Some of the photos might
be embarrassing for Kyoh.

130
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,291
[AKO, NANAKO]
Oh.

131

But now you've seen it,
and that's that.

There's no other choice left but
for you to both become members

133

of the secret society

punch, dump it, Nanako!

Is that Ako and
Nanako screaming?

Those idiots are probably
up to something.

[sighs]

145
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,875
If Nishimura were here,
he'd know exactly what to do.

146
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:12,916
So when the chips are down,

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you like having
Rusian on your side.

148
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,458
Is that so strange?

149
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,125
No, it's understandable.

150
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,291
But you usually treat Rusian
like he's some kind of insect.

151
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm sure he'd be surprised
if he heard you.

152
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,875
Wait, really? Is that how
I come across to you?

153
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,000
Huh?

154
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,458
During class, I may be
a little hard on him,

155
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,625
but I'm not like that
in the club, am I?

156
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,291
You don't honestly
think I'm some sort of

Nishimura-hating
monster, do you, Master?

158
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,833
Because that's not the
way I mean it at all.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,458
No, it looks like
I had the wrong idea.

160
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,375
You're a good kid, Schwein.

161
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,833
[chuckles]

162
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,708
Why are talking
to me like that?!

163
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,125
And who're you calling a kid?!

164
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:55,041
Don't you worry. Rusian
understands you perfectly.

165
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,791
[AKO] Somebody, please!
You've gotta help us!

166
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,250
[BOTH sigh]

167
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,166
[MAID A laughing]

168
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,375
[MAID A] Just a few moments
of your time, ladies!

169
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,583
Sign our mailing list now
for a free bulletin!

170
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,250
That was too close for comfort.

171
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,916
What's the deal? Do you
really dislike me that much?

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,583
No. It's just...

173
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,166
Instinctively, you sorta
make my skin crawl.

174
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,666
Uh?! I make your skin crawl?

175
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,583
No one's ever told
me that before.

176
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,916
It's not so bad.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,666
I've been told that a
few times up at school.

178
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,708
But hey, it's like water
off a duck's back!

179
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,166
[NANAKO]
It happens to you a lot, huh?

180
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,250
But still, when I said
I was interested

181
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,041
in becoming better friends
with you, I wasn't lying.

182
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,833
Oh. Okay.

183
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,041
All right. I'm lost.
Where are we?

184
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,250
[AKO]
Master! Master!

185
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,916
[gasps]

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,875
[AKO]
Master! We got lost!

187
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,041
And there's no way either of us
is going to find your room!

188
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,625
Without Nishimura around today,

189
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,958
I guess the whole "rescuing Ako"
thing falls to the two of us.

190
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,708
It's not a problem.

191
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,666
As the Master,
it's my responsibility.

192
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,166
What?

193
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,125
That "meow" lady from the
game is actually Ms. Saito?

194
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,458
Hey. It is fantasy.

195
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,541
That lying maniac actually
tricked my darling Rusian!

196
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,791
Oh man, if I'd met him first,
it wouldn't have gone that way!

197
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,750
You're sounding delusional, Ako.

198
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,500
What makes you think
you'd beat out Nekohime,

199
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,541
even if you met him first?

200
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,041
I'd make Rusian love me

201
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,708
even if I had to push that
cat-girl in front of a train!

202
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:47,166
Nothing says "true love"
like spastic aggression.

203
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,875
She must be stopped.

204
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,708
We don't need another
glitter wand incident.

205
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,875
Huh? What kind of
incident is that?

206
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,500
Ah... That was all part of
my dark, mysterious past.

207
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,375
And Ako's got more "dark past"
than any other girl her age.

208
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,000
You hear that? I'm number one!

209
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,833
Why don't we mix in some good
memories with that dark past.

210
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes. Please.

211
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,291
Summer vacation is
winding down, after all,

212
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,166
so we should do
something unforgettable.

213
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:21,500
Unless of course, you still have
to finish all of your homework.

214
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,458
Any progress?

215
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,166
Tee-hee.

216
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,958
Don't you dare say
"Tee-hee" to me!

217
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,333
Starting now, we're all gonna
watch you do your homework!

218
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,791
How 'bout not? Why ruin
a lovely afternoon?

219
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,083
You can't keep slacking off!

220
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,166
But I--

221
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,041
Rusian!

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,625
This looks really delicious.

223
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,375
But is it okay for us to start
without your parents?

224
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,958
Of course.

225
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,750
Our family chef has been looking
forward to treating our guests.

226
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,500
What kind of regular household
has a private chef?

227
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,791
Stop frowning and
dig in, Akane.

228
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,666
Also, you're holding
your fork wrong.

229
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,083
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,791
I've never had a fancy formal
meal like this before.

231
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,166
[chuckles]

232
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,583
Hey, Schew. That little
bowl full of water is there

233
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,791
if you wanna make a toast.

234
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,208
Of course! As if I didn't
know that already!

235
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,000
We raise the bowls
in each other's honor.

236
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,333
[KYOH chuckles]

237
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,916
To our merry band!

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,083
Though the day of our account
creations may differ,

239
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,125
may we all retire from
<i>Legendary Age</i> together!

240
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
Yes. So we hope.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You guys are so funny
using finger bowls

242
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,875
like they're glasses of wine.

243
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,208
What? Finger bowls?

244
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,875
These are here as an easy
way to clean your hands,

245
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:46,916
and not ruin napkins.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
[AKANE]
You tricked me, didn't you?

247
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,291
Yes, but I never assumed
you'd actually fall for it.

248
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,291
How does a crackpot like you
know about formal dining?

249
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,250
I wanted to be ready for when
Rusian decides to take me out,

250
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,916
so I studied up on it.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,416
You can study this, but you
can't get your homework done?

252
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,125
[KYOH]
Mmm. Dinner was delightful.

253
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,125
Now it's time to soak
in a nice, hot bath

254
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,958
and get ready for
our pajama party.

255
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,833
[AKANE] That's something
Nishimura couldn't take part in

256
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,041
even if he were here.

257
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,000
There'd be more soapy
hands to go around.

258
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:15,875
Soap?

259
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,041
It's better to just ignore her.

260
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,458
[AKANE]
It's massive.

261
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,583
Does a private residence
even need all this?

262
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,291
How many people are you planning
to bathe at the same time?

263
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,541
[KYOH] It may seem
like overkill to you,

264
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,000
but after much debate,

265
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,416
we decided having a small
bath in a house so big

266
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,750
would be poorly balanced.

267
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,916
Poorly balanced?

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,166
How does the size
of a bathroom

269
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,625
affect the balance of the house?

270
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,000
Move it! Let's go!

271
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,750
[AKO]
I'll head in later.

272
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,583
[AKANE] What are you
so embarrassed about?

273
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,541
It takes self-confidence to
strut into a place like this.

274
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,250
I just need to track
mine down real quick.

275
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,166
I understand how you feel.

276
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,541
Sharing a bath with other people

277
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,250
could certainly
make one nervous.

278
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,041
It can almost feel like your
heart's going to burst out!

279
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,375
If that's the case,

280
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,416
then why was this part of
your evening schedule?

281
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,916
Come on! Let's go already!

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,541
[AKO]
No! I can't!

283
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,875
I don't want to right now.

284
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,166
No means no.

285
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,666
I made a promise to myself

286
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,416
to make sure that Rusian
is my first time!

287
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,625
What first time do you
think is gonna happen?

288
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,916
Well duh. The first time
I share a bath with someone.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,083
That's too bad.

290
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,583
'Cause I already
claimed your first time

291
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,041
when we were at summer
camp, remember?

292
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,750
I-I guess you're right.

293
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,375
My first time is
now gone forever.

294
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
That's more Rusian's
fault than anyone else's.

295
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,583
He's lucky to have
friends like you.

296
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,041
Don't try to wash
anybody's hair with soap

297
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,875
like you did back at camp, okay?

298
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:51,916
Huh?

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,416
Sounds like you guys
had fun at camp.

300
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,208
I wish I could've gone!

301
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,125
But, Nanako,
you're not in the club.

302
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,000
Well I'm kind of in the club!

303
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,500
There's an unscalable wall.

304
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,541
And everyone outside
of it is not in the club!

305
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,791
I don't believe in
unscalable walls.

306
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,375
[AKO gasps]

307
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,083
Why do normies always say such
predictably uplifting nonsense?

308
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,125
Her soul wasn't beaten down.

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,750
What the hell?
This guild is really unfair.

310
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,041
[AKO]
What are you talking about?

311
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,666
[AKANE]
Look! Look! Look!

312
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,458
So what are we looking for?

313
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,750
We're all about the same age,

314
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,750
so why is there so much
difference between us?

315
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,875
It's totally messed up.

316
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,583
I mean what food
haven't I been eating?

317
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,041
I assumed that you customized
your character appearance

318
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,416
to be petite.

319
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,750
You don't get to choose
your character in real life!

320
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,500
[KYOH] That's not
entirely true, Schwein.

321
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:49,125
With exercise, a healthy,
well-rounded diet,

322
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,041
not to mention adequate sleep,

323
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,125
you too can have a
modicum of control

324
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,208
over your developing
young figure!

325
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,041
Yes. Your cuteness
is in your hands!

326
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,416
You heard the lady!

327
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,375
You failed to create any
cuteness, Shew. That's sad.

328
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,875
I don't have quite
enough materials

329
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,125
to make those items, Master.

330
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,041
There. All done.

331
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,791
[AKANE] How does a girl who
takes such terrible care

332
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,458
of herself have such
a perfect figure?

333
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,041
I tend to lead an
undeniably squishy lifestyle

334
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,166
in my free time.

335
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,791
My body got squishy too!

336
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,750
You're soft, but still
have good definition.

337
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,625
Do you have any diet tips?

338
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,416
Rusian likes me for who I am,
and he thinks I'm cute.

339
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,250
So I just eat what I want.

340
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,625
Every man prefers a certain
type. So what's his?

341
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,458
I've never even
bothered to ask.

342
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,583
But it might surprise you.

343
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,958
I think he's more
into slender ladies.

344
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,708
No. That's not true!
That's impossible!

345
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,625
I-- I'll ask him!

346
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,541
[NANAKO] Where'd that
cell phone come from?

347
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,083
It doesn't matter.

348
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,583
Just let her make her
stupid phone call.

349
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,333
All right then, I'll ask
him over video chat!

350
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,666
[AKANE]
Sure, sure.

351
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,541
Huh?! You're going to send
a video from the bath?!

352
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,625
I have to let Rusian look.

353
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,041
How else are we supposed
to know what he prefers?

354
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,583
You aren't seriously going to
broadcast from inside our bath?

355
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,625
I forbid it, as Guild
Master and host!

356
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,000
Please don't try to stop me!

357
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,625
Learning what kind
of girl Rusian prefers

358
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,125
could be the most important
quest I've ever undertaken!

359
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:30,916
That quest line...

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,291
...is totally forbidden!

361
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,541
Hey, back off!

362
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,125
[KYOH]
This will do irreparable damage

363
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,541
to our guild's efficiency!
Don't do it, Ako!

364
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,166
I don't care!

365
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,833
[AKO screams]

366
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,333
Over here, Ako! I'm wide open!

367
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,083
Thanks, Sette!

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,791
There, now it's turned off.

369
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,333
How could you?! You traitor!

370
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,500
What? I'm not sure
what you're upset about.

371
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,041
He didn't answer. It might've
gone to his voicemail.

372
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,500
It would've been a
disaster if he'd answered.

373
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,125
I'm amazed he was able
to read the situation.

374
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,791
It's easy to see just how
much he does for Ako.

375
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,958
Without him around,
she's out of control.

376
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,083
I was only going to show
myself in the video.

377
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,291
That's not the point,
you weirdo.

378
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,625
[AKANE] Seriously,
one bed fits four people?

379
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,125
This thing's ridiculous.

380
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,625
Today was one culture
shock after another.

381
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,958
Yeah, anybody would
think this is weird.

382
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,375
You may be right,

383
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,958
but no one's ever had the
chance to tell me before.

384
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,708
You're the first guests
I've ever invited

385
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,958
to a sleepover at my house.

386
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,166
Ako. Schwein. Sette.

387
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,333
I am beyond grateful
that you came.

388
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,166
What are you talking about?
We're all friends, right?

389
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,625
This is the first time
that I've ever been

390
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,875
invited to a sleepover,

391
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,416
so I'm feeling pretty
excited too, Master.

392
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,666
[NANAKO]
Oh, yeah?

393
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,833
If you're so excited,
let me feel your heart.

394
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,958
Watch out, Sette!
That's not my heart!

395
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,333
Okay, so what's with that?
You all call me by my game name.

396
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,583
Better get used to it.
That's how this club operates.

397
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,333
You know, doing stuff like
this with "just us girls"

398
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,708
can be pretty nice.

399
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,250
If I have to share a bed,

400
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,458
no offense, but I'd prefer
it was with Rusian.

401
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,166
And you can do that every night
when you're a married couple.

402
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,666
But we already are!

403
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,500
So I don't get how this works.

404
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,375
How exactly do you define your
relationship with him, Ako?

405
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,791
You're only married
to Rusian in the game,

406
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,333
but you behave like you
and Nishimura are a couple.

407
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,875
I was just wondering how your
thought process worked.

408
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,750
About Rusian and me?

409
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,958
Yeah, that's right.
Level with me.

410
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,708
You don't consider yourselves
married in real life, do you?

411
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,000
Uh.

412
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,166
I'm not really sure
how to put it.

413
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,541
That's a dangerous
question you're asking her.

414
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,583
Wait, is it? Haven't any
of you ever asked her?

415
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,625
The very prospect is terrifying.

416
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:04,208
Remember, if you gaze
into the abyss,

417
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:08,000
then the abyss eventually
gazes back into you.

418
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,291
What abyss?

419
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:18,083
Right! Picture, if you will,
a grand cathedral.

420
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,541
Let's say Sette, and, uh,
Schew were to get married.

421
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,333
[NANAKO]
Uh-huh.

422
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,541
[AKANE]
Why us?

423
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,750
[AKO] Solely for the
purpose of illustration.

424
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,250
Then, as a married couple,

425
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,625
you start playing
<i>Legendary Age</i> together.

426
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,708
It might go a little
something like this.

427
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,083
There's apparently a bonus
if our characters get married,

428
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,208
so why don't we have
an in-game wedding?

429
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,833
No way. Real life and
net games are different.

430
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,291
So we can't act
like we're married.

431
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,125
And what did our little
playlet reveal to you?

432
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,166
That your entire train of
thought is completely bonkers,

433
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,791
if I had to sum it up.

434
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,791
They're already married
in real life.

435
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,750
There's no reason not
to do it in the game.

436
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,916
You wouldn't want them marrying
someone else in the game.

437
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,416
That would be cheating.
How heart-breaking.

438
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,833
Right?

439
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,416
Now what do I do?

440
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,458
Heaven help me, I'm starting to
understand how her minds works!

441
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,291
It's not something I should get,

442
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,166
but I'm totally
picking up on it!

443
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,583
Oh, no! Our brains have
become tainted by Ako's mind.

444
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,041
Try to stay calm!

445
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,666
I thought my example was
pretty good. You guys are rude.

446
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,666
You're the one who's
being inconsiderate!

447
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,958
No one else is trying
to brainwash us!

448
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,333
How the hell does Nishimura

449
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,083
always handle Ako
like it's no big deal?

450
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,708
I've got it!
We should call Rusian!

451
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,708
He might be able to think
of something to do here!

452
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:29,750
Yeah, she's right!

453
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,041
We might actually
need that clown

454
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,625
if we're gonna fix this mess!

455
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,958
Please save us,
Nishimura the Brave!

456
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,041
Rusian! Everyone's
being mean to me!

457
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,583
Am I ever glad to see you!

458
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,125
Please help us, her crazy
is seeping into our brains!

459
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm begging! It's horrifying.
We need you!

460
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,208
Help! You have to rescue us!

461
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,041
[RUSIAN]
Huh?

462
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,375
[AKO] I didn't get to
see him at all today.

463
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,583
I'm going through withdrawals.
Oh, Rusian, I need my husband!

464
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,208
[NANAKO]
Now, now. Rusian isn't around,

465
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,333
but I'm here for you, buddy!

466
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,875
[AKO]
I don't want you!
