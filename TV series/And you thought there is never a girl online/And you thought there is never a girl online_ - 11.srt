1
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,708
They're here.

2
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,916
So these guys are the server's
top mercenary guild, huh?

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,458
Wallenstein.

4
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,666
Every one of them has
fully maxed out PvP equipment.

5
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,250
These guys are beyond hardcore.

6
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,500
With a buncha tough guys
like these fighting for us,

7
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,208
this should be a piece of cake!

8
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,541
[groans]

9
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,208
I guess this is what my
whole "hands-off approach"

10
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,375
as an advisor gets me.

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,333
[BATS]
What's up, guys?

12
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,583
Hiya.

13
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,166
Hello there!

14
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,833
--Yo.
--Nice to meet ya!

15
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,041
Meow!

16
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,458
We're looking forward
to playing with you!

17
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,708
Their uniforms make me nervous.

18
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,500
Guild Master Bats?

19
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,208
And you're this guild's master?

20
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,541
[KYOH]
Yes.

21
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,000
Sorry for the walk.

22
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,166
We can't form alliances near
the forts during a siege.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,583
So that's why I asked you to
meet us all the way out here.

24
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,791
[KYOH]
Yes, I understand.

25
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,541
[ANNOUNCER] Guild Alley Cats
and Guild Wallenstein

26
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,791
have formed an alliance
on the field of battle.

27
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,666
[KYOH]
All right then,

28
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,958
should we coordinate
what we're doing?

29
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,833
[BATS]
Sure. Why not?

30
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,875
Ako, are you the
guild's healer?

31
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,500
[AKO]
Ah!

32
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,750
Yes! That's right.

33
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,083
Do you mind if
we split the buffs

34
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,000
so that I focus on
Concentration?

35
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,625
That way you just have to
worry about Sacrament.

36
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,333
Uh, what? I mean, maybe.

37
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,666
Ah... Do you know
what that means?

38
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,791
Yes. I mean, kinda.

39
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,250
[MIZUKA sighs]

40
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,458
All right, you just worry about

41
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,875
healing the other people
in your party, okay?

42
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,208
You can just leave
the rest of it to me.

43
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,791
[AKO]
Okay.

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,000
You can handle it, Ako!
I wish mew the best!

45
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,083
Ah! You mean you're not
going to give me any help?

46
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,375
This battle is part of
your club activities.

47
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,833
As your teacher, I'm only
supposed to observe.

48
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,708
Come on.

49
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,750
[BATS] Huh... Lower level
character with that armor.

50
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,083
All right, I'll give you
suitable instructions.

51
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,750
Just do what I tell you.

52
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,250
Okay.

53
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,125
How 'bout this bad mamma-jamma?

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,666
You?

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,291
Grab that broadsword of yours,
charge in, and go hog-wild.

56
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,708
Hog-wild?

57
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,666
If I knew there were pigs,
I would've brought Mu-tan!

58
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,250
No.

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,541
He's basically telling her to go
on a total smash skill rampage

60
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,250
where she spams the attacks
as much as humanly possible.

61
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,500
In other words, he's telling
me not to think too much

62
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,458
and just swing my broadsword
around like a simpleton.

63
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,666
All right.
I'll show you hog-wild!

64
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,791
You want a broadsword tornado?
Then I'll give you one!

65
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,166
[HIDEKI]
Right. Cool. Good luck.

66
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,833
That's about it. Just tag along,
and try to stay out of our way.

67
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,583
You don't want to have a more
specific course of action?

68
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,375
There's really no need.

69
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,166
A fort this small won't even
make us break a sweat.

70
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,833
Very well.

71
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,125
[NANAKO]
So what do you say, Rusian?

72
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,583
[HIDEKI]
Hm?

73
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,791
Are these guys rude? Or am I
just being too sensitive?

74
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,375
She's right, these
guys're total jerks.

75
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,916
Take it easy.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,750
I'm sure they only seem more
direct because it's all in text.

77
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,750
[AKO]
Fort Cantor is still pretty big.

78
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,125
[HIDEKI] They have a
defensive line built up

79
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,708
around the entrance.

80
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,541
[BATS] Okay, Sette and Ako,
both of you split up

81
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,208
and run down opposite
sides of the fort's walls.

82
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:50,750
Huh?

83
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,125
What for?

84
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,958
Just do it. Take a lap,
and then you can come back.

85
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,958
Let's do what they say for now.
They are the professionals.

86
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,416
[EMPEROR SWORDSMAN]
Incoming!

87
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,500
Ah! I don't like this at all!

88
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,708
Perfect! That ought to thin the
ranks down on their front line.

89
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,750
We're being used as decoys?

90
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,750
What? That's so mean!

91
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,458
[HIDEKI]
It might not be pleasant,

92
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,500
but tactically,
it's the right play.

93
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,166
Wait! Not you, too!

94
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,750
[KYOH]
He's right.

95
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,625
With our non-combatants
acting as decoys,

96
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,083
we're able to spread
the opponent's forces

97
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,708
across the field.

98
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:46,083
In all honesty,
it's strategically sound.

99
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:50,708
Sadly, this isn't the way I
wanted us to win this battle.

100
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,375
[BATS] See? Now they're
chasing our rabbits.

101
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,541
[growls]

102
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's do this!

103
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
Uh. Sure.

104
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,416
I'll guess I'll take
all my frustration

105
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
out on the defending army!

106
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,625
Here comes their advance guard!

107
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,708
If you can pull them
forward just a little bit,

108
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,583
they'll be within
range of my spells!

109
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,916
So keep your head down!

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,291
[AKANE] Let me at 'em!
I'll stick 'em like pigs!

111
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,833
[HIDEKI] I've spent the whole
week practicing for this.

112
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,833
Time to show off what I can--

113
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,541
Huh?

114
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,833
It-It was over
before it started.

115
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,458
Awesome.

116
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,166
He perfectly predicted how
his opponent would move.

117
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,750
They're the best PvP
guild on the entire server.

118
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,625
Looks like they
earned that ranking.

119
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,583
I thought they stopped
focusing ranged attacks

120
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,916
on single targets.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,708
But apparently, the enemy's
archers in the rear

122
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,708
are dropping like flies.

123
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,500
[beeping]

124
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,916
[ALL]
Huh?

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,458
All of the Wallenstein players
are going to charge in.

126
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,291
And they're telling us
to follow behind?!

127
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,416
[AKANE]
Ugh. Why bother?

128
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
[HIDEKI]
Looks like they can handle it

129
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,875
without any of our help.

130
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,791
[KYOH] Yes. It would seem
we need not do anything.

131
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,666
Hey, we're still out here!

132
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,083
And they're still pouring
hell down on us!

133
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,833
I can't believe we made it back.

134
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,375
What's the matter?

135
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,333
Took you long enough.

136
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,958
[BATS]
So what are you waiting for?

137
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,958
Hurry up and place
your crystal in here.

138
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,375
[KYOH]
Oh, right. That's how it works.

139
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,416
[ANNOUNCER] Fort Cantor has
officially been captured

140
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,750
by Guild Alley Cats.

141
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,000
Now if you'll excuse me.

142
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,000
We're heading back
to town to resupply.

143
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,833
All right. Stay sharp, everyone.

144
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,416
Now that we've run
them out of the fort,

145
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,375
it won't be long until Emperor
Sword comes to take it back.

146
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,916
Naw.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,666
We can take care of the rest
of those guys on our way out.

148
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,791
You kids just stay here
and enjoy yourselves.

149
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,208
[KYOH]
Only ten minutes left.

150
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,916
[AKO] We conquered that fort
pretty easily, didn't we?

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,375
But I didn't get any
sense of accomplishment.

152
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,750
[SAITO] It certainly didn't play
out the way I would've hoped.

153
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,583
That was super lame!

154
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,750
[AKANE] Yeah, but once
we get our screenshot,

155
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,958
we'll have what we need
for the culture festival.

156
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,375
Luckily, it was easy.

157
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,416
[KYOH] Stay on your toes,
gang. It isn't over yet.

158
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,833
Right on.

159
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,000
We should probably focus on
building up our defenses

160
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,958
--until Bats gets back.

161
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,166
[ANNOUNCER] The alliance
between Guild Alley Cats

162
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,958
and Guild Wallenstein
has now been dissolved.

163
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,541
What?

164
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,250
Are you even allowed to break an
alliance during siege warfare?!

165
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,291
Only if all of the members
of one of the guilds

166
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,791
left the captured location,
but it is possible.

167
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,458
So then, if our alliance
with them is broken,

168
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,291
what exactly does that mean?

169
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,750
All bets are off,

170
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,875
and any attack on this fort
is an attack on our guild.

171
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,333
But what does that mean for us?

172
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,208
[BATS]
It means this.

173
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,666
[BATS laughs]

174
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,750
[ANNOUNCER] Fort Cantor has
officially been captured

175
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,000
by Guild Wallenstein.

176
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,625
Now that was an easy match.

177
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,375
[ANNOUNCER] Today's siege
warfare event is now complete.

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,166
Bats, why'd you betray us?

179
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,958
It's a lot more entertaining
to turn on you

180
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,125
when you think you've won.
Always good for a laugh!

181
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,291
So that's how it is.

182
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,416
It seems there's not
much we can do.

183
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,625
I'd like to thank you

184
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,375
for highlighting my
personal shortcomings.

185
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,500
I should've seen you
for who you really are.

186
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,208
Uh... I guess so?

187
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,125
Alley Cats, let's go.

188
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,125
Farewell, Guild Wallenstein.

189
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,458
We shall meet again someday.

190
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
That was a letdown.

191
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,666
I thought they'd blow
their tops for sure.

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,625
[screams]

193
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:42,458
Yet again I've given my students
another negative memory!

194
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,333
[NANAKO] Well that didn't work
out the way I thought it would.

195
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,333
[AKANE]
Yeah.

196
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,583
But on the other hand,
we kinda got what we deserved.

197
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,625
[NANAKO]
Hm?

198
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,333
Paying for the adventure.

199
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,625
That stuff's not
really my style.

200
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,458
Hiring mercenaries was
obviously the wrong choice.

201
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,958
I didn't like it from the start.

202
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,583
But still... those douchebags
took advantage of us.

203
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,583
And that's not okay.

204
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,958
[HIDEKI] Everyone else's work
on the culture festival

205
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,666
is pretty far along by now.

206
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,208
[AKO]
Yes, you're right.

207
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,000
We just need to keep
plowing ahead.

208
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,708
I suppose so.

209
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,000
[HIDEKI]
Hmm?

210
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,125
[HIDEKI]
Hey? Are you okay?

211
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,750
[AKO]
Rusian, I'm really sorry.

212
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,333
[HIDEKI]
For real?

213
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,708
Why are you apologizing to me

214
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,541
for what happened
during that siege battle?

215
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,250
[AKO]
When Bats turned on us,

216
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,416
there wasn't anything
I could do to stop him.

217
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,833
Hey, I wasn't able
to do anything

218
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,333
to that dumb jerk either.

219
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,833
So don't worry about it, Ako.

220
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,416
You don't have anything you
need to apologize to me for.

221
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,833
[AKO]
It isn't the responsibility

222
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,250
that's been bothering me.

223
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,875
I have this crushing
sense of regret

224
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,625
burning a hole in my heart.

225
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,500
That's the way it feels.

226
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,791
Regret?

227
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,333
[AKO]
Yes.

228
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,458
Whenever I do something,

229
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,125
it seems like nothing
good ever happens.

230
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,666
Which means I live my life so I
don't ever have to do anything.

231
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,750
It's strange.

232
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,000
There's only a couple of things

233
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,208
I've actually cared
about recently,

234
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,958
and I couldn't save them.

235
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,708
I could hardly believe
what I was seeing.

236
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,041
Watching him destroy
our crystal,

237
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,375
and not being able to stop it,

238
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,416
the entire experience
filled me with regret.

239
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,583
[HIDEKI]
That's great!

240
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,791
[AKO]
Huh?

241
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,833
Glad to hear you're
finally comin' around.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,041
Oh yeah?

243
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,916
It's almost like
you've leveled up.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,208
Whoa, really? You think I have?

245
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,125
Yeah, for sure!

246
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,583
In the past, generally speaking,
whenever things got unpleasant,

247
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,833
or called for a shred of
responsibility on your part,

248
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,666
you ran the other way.

249
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,625
And now we've actually got
you feeling some regret

250
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,833
for running away
from those problems.

251
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,625
That's real progress!

252
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,458
[HIDEKI] There's one more
round of siege warfare

253
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,958
happening next week.

254
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,041
That'll be our last chance.

255
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,250
[AKO]
Next time!

256
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,916
Next time for sure,
I wanna try even harder!

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,208
I don't wanna let
everyone down again.

258
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,833
Win or lose,
I'll fight till the end.

259
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,916
Yeah! But let's set out
to win from the start.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,666
Nothing to regret
if we pull it off!

261
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,958
Right!

262
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,666
[HIDEKI]
Hard at work, Madam President?

263
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,625
Cut that out. It's creepy.

264
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,291
[HIDEKI]
How's it creepy?

265
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,916
You're doing student
council president stuff,

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,791
so I called you "President."

267
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,333
There's no need for you
to stand on ceremony.

268
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,208
But if you insist on
being so formal...

269
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:55,625
While I'm in the office, please
call me "Your Excellency."

270
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,166
Yes, Your Excellency.

271
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,458
Hmm?

272
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,541
Would you please stop sitting
there, silently blushing?!

273
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,958
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,250
I've never had a boyfriend
before, as I've said,

275
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,750
and hearing you call me that,
my heart just skipped a beat.

276
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,333
You told me to say it!

277
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,583
[KYOH]
So what did you need?

278
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,041
I came here to discuss
the upcoming battle with you.

279
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,791
Not to worry.

280
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,000
I already have some new gear

281
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,583
that will allow me
to keep casting,

282
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,875
even when I'm under attack.

283
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,916
Whoa, all the prices
for that stuff skyrocketed

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,666
after the event started,
didn't they?!

285
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,750
Also, I decided to stock up
on several reflect potions

286
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,958
that bounce the damage you
sustain back at your opponent.

287
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,000
Those are pretty expensive, too.

288
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,666
Now, when you say
stocked up...

289
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,375
Precautions must be taken
if we hope to win.

290
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,041
Besides, I'm the one
who came up with

291
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,250
this whole siege idea
in the first place.

292
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,583
So let me take care of it.

293
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,041
"Let me take care of
it," she says. Huh.

294
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,208
What's up?

295
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,416
[chuckles]

296
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,750
[giggles]

297
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,000
[ALL] Welcome home, Master!
How can we serve you?

298
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,416
What's the deal
with these things?

299
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,291
Remember?

300
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,041
I'm sure we mentioned it before.

301
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,958
About the time we went over
to the president's house

302
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,458
to spend the night?

303
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,208
[AKANE] Master had the uniforms
they came up with for that

304
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,583
altered and brought them in
for us to use in the maid café.

305
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,041
Hey, that's great!

306
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,500
Now that you've found
some maid uniforms,

307
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,125
the biggest issue is
out of the way, right?

308
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,208
Your work's just about
done, isn't it, Ako?

309
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,125
Um. Yeah of course! Mostly.

310
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,666
[HIDEKI]
Eh?

311
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,208
Great. So, Ako?

312
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,375
What can I do for you, Rusian?

313
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,291
You have everything
else for your maid café

314
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,666
prepared already, don't you?

315
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,250
You are the head maid.

316
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,125
Yeah, but, you see, thing is--

317
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,875
[HIDEKI]
How's it coming along?

318
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,833
It isn't coming along at all!

[GIRL A]
Wow! How cute!

320
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,791
[GIRL C] You have the
maid uniforms ready!

321
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,750
[GIRL B]
They look awesome, Tamaki!

322
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,250
There's bad news!

323
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,541
Though Ako lined up these
terrific-looking maid outfits,

324
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,958
she hasn't assigned shifts
or written a serving manual.

325
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,541
[STUDENTS gasp]

326
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,750
[HIDEKI]
We're sorry! Please help us!

327
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,458
What? We've only got a week
to put this all together!

328
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,583
Telling us this late,
there's not a lot we can do.

329
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,625
Don't you work at a
restaurant, Matsui?

330
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,875
You think you could bring some
extra serving manuals in?

331
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,375
They probably wouldn't
want me to take them.

332
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,166
But if I snag a couple
for a school project,

333
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,625
they can't get too upset.

334
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,083
Hey, guys!

335
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,458
Come tell us when you can
or can't take a shift.

336
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,541
All of you! Boys too!

337
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,375
[GIRL B] I have a conflict
in the first two hours...

338
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,541
[AKO]
Huh?

339
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,583
--I could fill in for her.
--After five?

340
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,916
--Same here.
--Who else?

341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,958
You see that?

342
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,000
That's the old-fashioned,

"Sorry,

strategy.

345
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,166
What the what?

346
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,166
If there's something
you can't do,

347
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,250
and you don't tell anybody,

348
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,041
that's when people
get ticked off.

349
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,458
If you're unable
to do something,

350
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,375
just tell them you can't
from the beginning.

351
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,625
Well, I guess.

352
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,250
Sometimes, you have
to rely on others

353
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,541
if you ever want
to move forward.

354
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,208
I mean, you do that kinda thing
all the time in the game, right?

355
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,500
[AKO]
Huh?

356
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,458
[HIDEKI] "I can't do that."
"I can't do this."

357
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,458
"Rusian, please help me!"

358
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,208
Once you've figured out
how to ask the other people

359
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
working with you for a
little bit of assistance,

360
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,708
you can solve pretty much
any problem there is.

361
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,166
That's one of the lessons net
games taught me about life.

362
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,166
Uh.

363
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,416
Hm? Rusian?

364
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,833
[CLOUD] You want us to
team up with the Alley Cats

365
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,958
during siege warfare?

366
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,500
[HIDEKI]
Please, I'm begging you!

367
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,708
[CLOUD]
All right. You've got it.

368
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,708
For real?

369
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,208
Yeah.

370
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,333
It's not like you guys are
complete strangers to us anyway.

371
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,791
Besides,

372
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,416
those traitorous degenerates
slew our beloved Nekohime,

373
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,625
an offense that cannot stand!

374
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,458
[ELITE GUARD]
Guilty!

375
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,666
[HIDEKI] Now then.
This is our next stop.

376
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,375
[Alliance, huh?

377
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,458
Unfortunately, TMW currently
has its hands full

378
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,000
holding off Guild Aristocrats

379
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,875
from taking the great
citadel of Gramberg.

380
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,833
Apologies, but we simply
don't have anyone

381
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,750
we can spare to help you.

382
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,166
That's not what we're
asking for, my friend.

383
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,958
We just need you allied
with us as a bargaining chip.

384
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,541
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
Hm?

385
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,541
How many forts have been taken

386
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,208
only to be lost to a larger
guild who comes and attacks,

387
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,541
solely to kill a little time
and some boredom?

388
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,291
An alliance with you would be
a deterrent against that.

389
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,708
Quite brilliant.

390
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,583
Nobody's stupid enough
to pick a fight with us

391
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,041
just to kill some time.

392
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,541
[HIDEKI]
Precisely my point.

393
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,291
But as we speak, Fort Cantor
is occupied by Wallenstein,

394
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,291
the server's finest PvP players.

395
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,750
Even working with
the veteran players

396
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,625
of Nekohime's Elite Guard,

397
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,583
the siege itself should
prove rather difficult.

398
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,833
[HIDEKI]
It's true that right now

399
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,083
our chances of winning
are on the slim side.

400
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,250
But we want to throw everything
we can possibly muster

401
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,166
at those jerks asap!

402
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,375
So be it.

403
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,750
TMW agrees to a formal alliance
with Guild Alley Cats.

404
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,875
Are you certain?

405
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,166
Indeed. There are no
detracting factors

406
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,958
for our guild in
making this alliance.

407
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,083
But there's no real merit
in it for you, either.

408
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,875
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
I disagree.

409
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,375
It sounds like it might be fun.

Quick! To our lady's side!

[KABO-TAN]
Nekohime, we've failed!

416
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,375
My heart will go on!

417
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,000
Now you're mine!

This is supposed to be practice,
so hold back a little next time!

00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,041
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
It appears your training's

422
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,666
coming along quite well.

423
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,250
TMW would be interested
in recruiting you.

424

kind of you to come

and observe our siege
warfare practice.

426

It's the least I can
do to help you out.

I say. That is some
top notch gear.

429
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Must've cost a fortune.

430
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,625
It cost nothing.

431
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,333
Huh? You're joking.

432
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,208
[KYOH] Nothing compared
to turning the tables

433
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,625
on your enemy!

434
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,208
Taking revenge is priceless!
