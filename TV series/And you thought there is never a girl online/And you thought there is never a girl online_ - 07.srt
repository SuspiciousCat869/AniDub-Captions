1
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,666
[SAITO] Looks like someone
didn't get enough sleep!

2
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,208
Did you stay up all night
grinding faction reputation?

3
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,500
Yeah, well...

4
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,083
It's just past the
butt crack of dawn,

5
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,666
but you look wide awake
and ready to go.

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,791
Back in college, I was
on the wrestling team.

7
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,791
We had practice every morning!

8
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,333
There they are.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,791
Morning.

10
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,041
Good morning, Rusian.

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,125
Whoa.

12
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,583
[growls]

13
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,250
I didn't touch her!
Just the arms!

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,583
I don't care about that.
I'm just sleepy.

15
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,625
Oh. Cool.

16
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,500
Well, that's everyone!

17
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,541
Then let us begin.

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,500
The first annual Modern
Communications

19
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:37,291
Electronic Game Club
summer camp starts now!

20
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,291
This camp will build
our physical endurance,

21
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,541
leading to longer, more
efficient raid sessions.

22
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,166
As such, during camp...

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,000
...net connection is
henceforth prohibited!

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,583
It's called: The 24 Hour

25
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,833
No-Net-Connectivity-Camp
Excursion!

26
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:03,333
[AKO screams]

27
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,666
[AKANE yawns]

28
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,875
[HIDEKI] The net's totally
off-limits during the camp?

29
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,083
That's right.

30
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,625
[AKANE] Is this whole
"no internet" thing

31
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,708
a plan to force Ako to stop
associating her in-game persona

32
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,166
with real life?

33
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,166
Not quite. It goes deeper.

34
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,375
Ako's totally absorbed in gaming

35
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,916
because it's the one part of
her life that she can control.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,541
You agree? Rusian?

37
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,250
Uh. Yeah.

38
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,000
But if we can
turn things around,

39
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,541
she won't want to escape a
world where things go her way.

40
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,791
[AKANE]
Hmm...

41
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,666
You might actually be
onto something there.

42
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,166
[KYOH] Which means we
need to stick with her

43
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,333
throughout the break.

44
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,833
Teach her to enjoy her youth,

45
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,208
to spend the summer like
a normal high school girl.

46
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,208
Toss in a proper love confession
under the right circumstances,

47
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,375
and things are bound to go well.

48
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,458
But wait a minute.

49
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,166
What constitutes a
proper confession

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,583
under the right circumstances?

51
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,291
Like sitting on the beach
watching the sun set?

52
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,375
Or maybe gazing up into a
star filled sky together?

53
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,375
[KYOH] Either of those
options and many more

54
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,291
would work where we're going.

55
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,125
But the rest of it's up to you.

56
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,500
[sighs]

57
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,083
Right. No pressure.

58
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,833
Sure. I can totally do this.

59
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,083
Just declare my love,

60
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,708
and hope Ako will accept
me on real life terms.

61
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,291
[gasps]

62
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,833
[SAITO]
GTFO.

63
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,041
This "cottage" makes my
apartment look like a closet!

64
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,833
How much was this place? Huh?

65
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,875
[HIDEKI] Um, you probably
shouldn't grill your student

66
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,041
on income-related stuff.

67
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,125
Right, of course. Never mind me.

68
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,416
It's like some fancy hotel.

69
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,541
So we drop off
our bags and then?

70
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,958
Dusting? Futon drying?

71
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,833
The caretakers knew
we were coming.

72
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,458
The staff would've already
taken care of all that.

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,166
Well, that was easy.

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:00,916
[SAITO gasps]

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
No!

76
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,083
This isn't what a club camp is
supposed to be like you guys!

77
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,416
Cleaning and bed-making
are all part of the deal!

78
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,458
Those are the camp experiences
that build character!

79
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,291
Indentured servitude
is part of what

80
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,125
makes the process legit, right?

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,208
[HIDEKI]
Our own private beach? Unreal.

82
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,333
[AKO]
Rusian!

83
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:30,333
[giggling]

84
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,791
[AKO]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

85
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,000
[AKO]
What? What's wrong?

86
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,250
You keep staring at my top.
Is there a stain?

87
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,250
Uh! No!

88
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,750
So, uh... Where's everyone else?

89
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,291
[AKO] They were all
taking way too long,

90
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,541
so I decided to come
out and join you.

91
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,083
I didn't want you to
get lonely waiting.

92
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,875
Cool, that's nice.

93
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,875
No need to be bashful.
You look great!

94
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,333
[AKO] When I first picked
out this swimsuit,

95
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,541
I was really excited about it.

96
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,250
Now, when the time comes
to actually put it on,

97
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
out of nowhere,
I feel so self-conscious.

98
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,416
[HIDEKI]
Don't worry.

99
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,208
It's cute. Really.
You look lovely.

100
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,708
Thank you very much.

101
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,291
[AKANE sighs]

102
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,666
[AKANE] Big surprise,
you came out here first, Ako.

103
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,416
[KYOH]
Ugh.

104
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,958
You've ruined my plan;
I'll have you know.

105
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,000
To all show up in
swimsuits together.

106
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,083
And send Rusian running
off, nose bleeding!

107
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,625
No, no nosebleeds.
Thanks anyway.

108
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,125
[AKANE]
By the way, Ako,

109
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,166
did you already put
on some sunblock?

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,500
If you spend all day in the sun

111
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,125
with skin as freakishly
pale as yours,

112
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:15,208
you'll be miserable
for a week straight!

113
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,583
You'll have a sunburn so
bad that it hurts to even move!

114
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,291
[whimpering]

115
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:26,083
[AKO laughing]

116
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,666
Just try to hold
still, would ya?

117
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,625
[AKO]
Hey, that tickles!

118
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,875
[AKANE]
Though I have to say,

119
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,375
you're soft and squishy
in all the right places.

120
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,875
[AKO]
Yeah, I just kinda...

121
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,166
My goodness! It looks like
you don't have any either.

122
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,333
Wha--? No. I don't really--

123
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,250
We're all friends.
I'll rub some on for you.

124
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,583
No thanks.

125
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,708
I'd be glad to lend you
a hand with that as well.

126
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,750
Whoa!

127
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,916
I wanna rub some
of this on you too!

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,541
Hold on!

129
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,458
[HIDEKI screams]

130
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,541
[HIDEKI] Slow down! No! Not
there! That's nice! Too much!

131
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,250
Ah!

132
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,291
I can't take anymore!

133
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,958
I'm spent. Defiled
and tossed aside.

134
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,291
It was just sunscreen, Rusian.

135
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,750
You should be thanking
us, quite frankly.

136
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,208
[SAITO] Looks like everyone
is ready to me!

137
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,708
[SAITO]
Okay, let's get to it!

138
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,333
[AKO, AKANE, KYOH]
Yeah!

139
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,250
[HIDEKI]
Yeah...

140
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,958
[BOTH sigh]

141
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,708
[laughing]

142
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,833
Aww... Great swimming!

143
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,416
And great diving!

144
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,250
A great day for floating.

145
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,541
Perfect day for floating!

146
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,041
How strange.

147
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:18,333
You all look like you've had
your fill, but it's midday!

148
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,125
And another thing, why
didn't you all play together

149
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,041
like a real club would?

150
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,208
Well, Miss,
the thing is... Hmm...

151
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,750
It's kinda like this!

152
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,916
Imagine there's an expansion
pack, with an entirely new map.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,500
[SAITO]
Okay.

154
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,125
[HIDEKI] All right, so we all
head to the new map together.

155
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,875
But then, once there,
we immediately split up.

156
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,333
[SAITO]
But why?

157
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,291
[HIDEKI] To learn important
things about the new zone.

158
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,375
Like how good the XP is
for solo grinding.

159
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,708
Or if the enemies
drop any rares.

160
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,625
And, more often than not,
learning where the graveyard is.

161
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,708
Huh... And then?

162
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,958
[HIDEKI] After we've made our
rounds, we join up again.

163
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,041
We compare notes, and
gauge zone productivity.

164
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,416
We each do what we want,
then come back when we're done.

165
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,083
That's our pattern.

166
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,041
So is that the new normal
for today's teenagers?

167
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,833
I can't speak for every
other high schooler,

168
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,666
but it's normal for us.

169
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,916
Now that you got me
talking about it,

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,083
I really wanna play some <i>LA</i> .

171
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,416
he internet is off-limits
while we're at camp.

172
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,916
Yeah, I know, but--

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,250
I'm over playing
around in the water.

174
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,416
I might go inside
and take a nap.

175
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't believe you kids.

176
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,333
You're at an awesome summer
camp with a private beach!

177
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,250
How can you guys not
wanna run around free,

178
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,041
untamed and glistening
with youthful perspiration?

179
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,000
[AKANE] Did you just say
"youthful perspiration"?

180
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,458
None of us are big on sweating.

181
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,083
Look, life is tough, and like
it or not, quitters never win!

182
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,083
Just give it all your heart!
You can do it if you try!

183
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,583
Why won't you give it
everything you've got?

184
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,250
Because we usually just
decide to move on

185
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,541
if we try out a new game--

186
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,500
There's no "moving on"
from real life, clowns!

187
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,750
Back to work!
Get your butts in gear!

188
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,083
That is an order
from your advisor!

189
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,291
Nope!

190
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,375
[BOTH laughing]

191
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,625
[AKO]
Okay! Ready?

192
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,666
Go up, up; down, down!

193
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,291
[KYOH] Then you need to go
left right, left right.

194
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,750
And finish it up
with some B A!

195
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,333
How's the Konami Code
supposed to help?

196
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,166
Our work here is done.

197
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,125
Oh, come on!
Not funny, you guys!

198
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,916
[ALL laughing]

199
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,583
[sighs]

200
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,333
[HIDEKI] That whole
"youthful perspiration" thing

201
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,166
was pretty fun.

202
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,750
Now then,

203
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,916
I suppose I should tell Ako how
I feel while we're still young.

204
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,666
Rusian!

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,250
You don't mind if
I come in, do you?

206
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,375
[gasps]

207
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,500
[AKANE] What the heck do
you think you're doing?!

208
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,375
[AKO] A little bit longer!
Just give me a little longer!

209
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,125
--[AKO] It was getting good!
--[AKANE] Absolutely not!

210
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,083
She saw...

211
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,333
BBQ is on!

212
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,375
[AKANE]
You mean barbecue?

213
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,166
BBQ! Let's go!

214
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,500
[HIDEKI]
Ohh... She's in denial.

215
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,166
[AKO]
Um...

216
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,125
So why haven't you prepped any
of the ingredients for the meal?

217
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,083
[KYOH]
Prepping... is what?

218
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,416
Don't worry about it.
I'll see what I can do.

219
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,375
I wanna give it a shot, too!

220
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,333
We don't really have the time.

221
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,708
[AKANE] I can't believe
Ako wouldn't let me help.

222
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,666
Like I'd just end up
getting in her way.

223
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,125
[HIDEKI]
Oh man! I call that one!

224
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,333
[HIDEKI]
Whew. Now that was good eatin'.

225
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,333
[AKO]
It was pretty yummy, wasn't it?

226
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,625
[HIDEKI]
Still, I can't believe

227
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,000
you're the only one
of us who could cook.

228
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,125
We'd be in real trouble
if you hadn't come along.

229
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,000
[AKO chuckles]

230
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,416
[AKANE] Behold this bad
mamma-jamma's Burning Edge!

231
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,708
[HIDEKI] Is she acting out
a broadsword skill?

232
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,916
[AKO]
She is flailing around a lot.

233
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,666
[HIDEKI]
That's kinda dangerous though.

234
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,041
[SAITO]
Oh no you don't!

235
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,250
[HIDEKI]
Around and around she goes.

236
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,625
[SAITO]
Coaching complete!

237
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:57,666
[BOTH laughing]

238
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,208
[KYOH] Looks like the timing
is just about perfect.

239
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,750
[HIDEKI]
What's the matter, Ako?

240
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,541
Oh, uh...

241
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,041
It's nothing.

242
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,541
I tried to keep from crying,
and it just made it harder.

243
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,458
I couldn't help it.
I'm just so happy.

244
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,958
This whole day has been perfect.

245
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,250
I never dreamed my life
could be like this.

246
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,000
I just-- I feel lucky
for the first time.

247
00:15:56,083 --> 00:16:00,375
And still, can't help
feeling a little sad.

248
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,708
Ako.

249
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,250
[AKO]
Um...

250
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,458
I really wanna thank you.

251
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,708
Thank for what?

252
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,166
Because if I'd never met you,

253
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,625
I never would've come here
and had such a wonderful day!

254
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,583
Guess what? If it
weren't for you, Ako,

255
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,833
I wouldn't be
here today, either.

256
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,500
Then it works out.

257
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,166
Good thing we're
together, isn't it?

258
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,041
[HIDEKI]
Yeah.

259
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,916
Listen...

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,333
Uh, Ako?

261
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,708
I love you.

262
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,333
[gasps]

263
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,458
You love me?

264
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,958
I love you too, Rusian.

265
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,375
So very much!

266
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,416
We're a great married couple.

267
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,666
Anyone would agree!

268
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,291
[HIDEKI] Despite everything,
it didn't work.

269
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,791
[BOTH sigh]

270
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,541
I would've sworn a
no net, normie summer

271
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,750
would've done the job,
but I guess I was mistaken.

272
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,250
Yeah, she definitely
still thinks

273
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,250
you're a married
couple in real life.

274
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,875
[HIDEKI]
And the worst part?

275
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,916
After all the struggling,
I had a revelation!

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,958
This: A husband totally
outranks a boyfriend.

277
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:40,500
It doesn't matter what I do.
Ako refuses to change her mind!

278
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,125
[HIDEKI crying]

279
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,250
I'm afraid this quest...

280
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,916
...has ended in failure.

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,291
[SAITO]
Come on, you guys!

282
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,166
It's time for lights out!

283
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,500
We got a busy day tomorrow.

284
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,375
[KYOH]
Okay! Ready?

285
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,416
Master. Why'd we pack up?
Where are we going now?

286
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,125
[chuckles] Someplace good.

287
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,083
[KYOH]
The Hotel Flores!

288
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
As of right now,
the Modern Communications

289
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,875
Electronic Gaming Club's
true camp begins!

290
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,875
[AKO gasps]

291
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,333
[HIDEKI]
What the--?

292
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,875
[KYOH]
We're in luck.

293
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,083
This hotel is part of a
<i>Legendary Age</i> collaboration.

294
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,041
[AKANE]
What kinda hotel would do that?

295
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,250
Sounds like a last attempt
to keep from going bankrupt.

296
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,083
They have a Powaring
King plushie!

297
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,666
He's so soft!

298
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,166
Segawa, you sure you
don't wanna go to?

299
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,750
Shut up! Of course I don't!

300
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,333
[SAITO]
Okay, we're all checked in!

301
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,541
Your keys. Here.

302
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,666
[HIDEKI]
What's this thing?

303
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,750
[KYOH]
Your token to use for the event.

304
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,666
And it's adorable!

305
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,000
One more thing.

306
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,250
As a result of abstaining
from the net for a day,

307
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,541
our training regimen has
given a permanent boost

308
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,833
to our gaming ability!

309
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:05,041
By using these token passes...

310
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,541
...you'll log in over there,

311
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,333
and the much-anticipated
event will begin!

312
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,791
[HIDEKI] I get it. So that's
what these tokens are for.

313
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,791
[HIDEKI] After entering in
that token's key code,

314
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:22,291
we just input our ID
and password as usual.

315
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,291
Hey, no peeking. It's just rude.

316
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,541
Uh! But what's wrong with it?

317
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,500
Couples share everything,
including passwords!

318
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,625
No, they don't.

319
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,833
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

320
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,166
What's wrong?

321
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,166
Well, uh, it didn't
take my password, I guess.

322
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,541
Must've typed it wrong.

323
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,708
[HIDEKI] That's because Ako
was butting in on me.

324
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,541
[AKO chuckles]

325
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,958
All right, I'm in.

326
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,250
Wow. Check it out!

327
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,541
The floor plan's just like
the real-life hotel!

328
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,625
[AKANE]
It's a special map

329
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,125
that only event
participants can enter.

330
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,208
"Hello, and welcome to

331
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,875
the <i>Legendary Age</i> Select
Collaborative Event.

332
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,875
There are several exciting
and rare bonuses

333
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,916
set aside for all
of our participants.

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,250
Begin by going to the restaurant

335
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,791
on the first floor
of Hotel Flores."

336
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,083
Huh.

337
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,416
[AKO squeals]

338
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,333
[AKO] There are special items
listed off to the side

339
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,000
of the dishes!

340
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,416
Does that mean
whatever you order

341
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,833
you unlock the matching
item in the game?

342
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,208
[KYOH]
That's right.

343
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,708
That's evil! It's immoral!

344
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,750
But I can't keep myself from
ordering strength-buffing items!

345
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,166
Okay, so you take
the code on the card

346
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,333
that came with the check,
and enter it into the game

347
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,375
to unlock your new rewards.

348
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,750
There's something
written on the back.

349
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,291
"Brave adventurers young and old

350
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,041
can find similar
bonuses awaiting them

351
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,916
in the first floor
gift shop." Huh.

352
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,291
[HIDEKI] So what's up with
the couple dozen boxes

353
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,125
of gingerbread cookies
you got there?

354
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,000
What am I supposed to do?!

355
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,875
These happen to come with
the items I wanted most!

356
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,958
A special item
matching sales event

357
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,250
might not be the smartest way

358
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,583
to teach the students
about budgeting.

359
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,458
Since we ended up
with more stuff,

360
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
I say it's time to split up.

361
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,791
Let's take a break
and head to our rooms.

362
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,791
She's right.

363
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,166
We checked in a while ago

364
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,666
and we haven't even been up
to see our rooms yet.

365
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,333
Our room blocks are tied into
this cross-promotional event.

366
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,916
They come fully-equipped
with computers

367
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,583
and internet connections.

368
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,125
That means we can unlock
the items we just got!

369
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,583
[chuckles]

370
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,666
Yes, we can!

371
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,458
Where're Schew and Master?

372
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,791
Where else?

373
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,291
They both went to try out
their brand new items!

374
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,000
No surprise.
I guess we should too.

375
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,208
Sure, we could do that, or...

376
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:03,916
If you'd like... to maybe...
come to my room?

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,291
Uh?

378
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,500
Duh, of course.

379
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,000
When you said come to
your room, you meant in <i>LA</i> .

380
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,583
[AKO]
Rusian.

381
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,208
[AKO]
We're in this fancy hotel,

382
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,583
sitting alone, together,
here in my room.

383
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:32,583
I-- I've been waiting for this
for a really long time.

384
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,833
Rusian?

385
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:45,083
So, uh, what were you saying?

386
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,583
It's finally our chance!
Alone together at last!

387
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,166
Well I was thinking,

388
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,375
maybe we could engage
in some couples chat?

389
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,208
[FAKE RUSIAN]
Couples, eh?

390
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,958
[AKANE] What's the big idea
with the swimsuits?

391
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,375
Just because it's summer,

392
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,000
we don't have to stroll around
wearing next to nothing!

393
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,583
[RUSIAN] It's okay,
your swimsuit was modest!

394
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,125
And you don't have a
lot to show off anyway.

395
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,000
[AKANE]
You want an ass whooping?
