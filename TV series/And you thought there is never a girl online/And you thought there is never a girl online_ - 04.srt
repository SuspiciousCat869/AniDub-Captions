1
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,750
[RUSIAN] Not long after I had
declared my love for Nekohime,

2
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,708
I looked for a change.

3
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,083
Back when I was brokenhearted
and questing solo.

4
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,250
So you're interested
in joining our guild?

5
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,250
Yes! That is,
if you'll have me.

6
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,500
[BLACK MAGICIAN] Well then,
let me conduct an interview.

7
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,333
Huh? Interview?

8
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,583
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
First of all,

9
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,250
what are your reasons
for wanting to join us?

10
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,500
Yeah. Uh, well.

11
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,833
I've been playing solo
for quite a while now,

12
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,541
and in addition to
not being lonely,

13
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,500
a guild would help me
to hone my skills.

14
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,708
Tell me what you do IRL.

15
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,250
[RUSIAN]
I'm a high school student.

16
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,750
[BLACK MAGICIAN] Meaning you're
the type that drops out

17
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,333
when it's time to eat,
drops out to go take a bath,

18
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,833
and is unable to log in
for late night raids.

19
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,958
Generally, our guild
grinds very thoroughly,

20
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,625
taking a minimum of three
hours to clear a dungeon.

21
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,416
I don't think
you'd be a good fit.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,916
Ah, you don't say.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,375
Maybe if I dropped out of high
school, I would fit right in.

24
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,625
Is that what you're getting at?

25
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,958
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
That's right.

26
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,875
We have many guild members
who have quit school

27
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:41,333
or even careers to devote
their time to net games.

28
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,125
You know about reincarnating,
don't you?

29
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,375
Yeah.

30
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,833
Once you've maxed out
your character's level,

31
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:47,958
you can start a new toon

32
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,875
to carryover the
old one's skill set.

33
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,125
Our guild is full of characters

34
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,833
that have done it two,
even three times.

35
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,166
[RUSIAN]
Um, well I, uh,

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,375
I think that may be
a little too much.

37
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,916
Thanks for your time.
Please excuse me!

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,750
[HIDEKI] And that was
the end of my interview.

39
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,750
Oh wow. That was a pretty
hardcore guild, wasn't it?

40
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,458
Yeah. Mega hardcore.

41
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,541
Like, they've been
playing so hard

42
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,208
they haven't seen
the sun in weeks.

43
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,083
They were intimidating, sure,
but ended up being pretty cool.

44
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,541
[BLACK MAGICIAN]
Say, hold up.

45
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,000
Even if you're not in our guild,

46
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,208
you're still a fellow
player of the game.

47
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,375
If you're ever having any
troubles, feel free to stop by.

48
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,833
I think that sounds really nice!

49
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,208
What sounds really nice?

50
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,250
Spending all day everyday
playing the game

51
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,041
just like those guild people!

52
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,875
Come on, you just
got in trouble

53
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,291
for skipping school
to play the game,

54
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,750
and now you wanna
do it for life?

55
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,750
Oh, Rusian, I just
wanna quit school,

56
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,458
and build a home where
we could play the game

57
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,875
while you support us!

58
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,375
Uh.

59
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,166
Ah!

60
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,083
Whoopsie. I seem to have
left my wallet at home.

61
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,125
[HIDEKI]
Huh?

62
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,125
[AKO]
Oh! I know what I can do.

63
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,583
I should be able to
sell enough junk

64
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,166
to the vendor to buy a soda!

65
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey. We aren't in the game,
so that's not gonna work.

66
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,583
You're right!
I can't open my inventory!

67
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,416
She's getting worse.
You're seein' this, right?

68
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,791
[COACH A]
Maegasaki! Fight! Fight!

69
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,208
[TEAM]
Oh! Oh! Oh!

70
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,666
It's getting worse, isn't it?

71
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,000
If we're bein' honest,

72
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,166
this kind of thing happens
to me from time to time.

73
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,708
I'll admit it:

74
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,583
I've slept in before, thinking
I could use a teleport token

75
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,333
to instantly appear in school.

76
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,541
Yes.

77
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,875
Whenever I see something
that I really want,

78
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,625
I find myself looking
for the "Pay" button

79
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,041
without even realizing it!

80
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,625
I know, right?
Like all the time!

81
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,541
Do you hear yourselves?

82
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,958
Have you forgotten the true
purpose of the Net Game Club?

83
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,625
Or do you guys not care
that poor Tamaki

84
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,708
will go through life unable
to understand the difference

85
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,750
between gaming and reality?

86
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,666
With the way things are going,
I think it might be better

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,125
if we dissolved
the club entirely,

88
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,458
and you all agree to quit
playing online games.

89
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,708
Cold turkey.

90
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,291
[KYOH] Such a request
is simply meow-trageous.

91
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,083
[chuckles]

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,916
Well then.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,208
Why don't we move on to the
club's scheduled activities?

94
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,666
I have a meeting to attend,
so please excuse me.

95
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,625
Poor old Nekohime sure
seems to have it rough.

96
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,166
I'm sure us knowing she
plays the game doesn't help.

97
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,041
[KYOH] Okay! Let today's
club meeting commence!

98
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,458
You seem extra amped
up today, Master!

99
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,291
Yes, apparently a new
mystery box feature

100
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,500
will be introduced in
today's patch update.

101
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,291
Now you can spend more money.

102
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,416
No, don't buy any mystery boxes.
They're a total waste.

103
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,375
Stop being such a downer!

104
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,083
Listen, every gamer longs for
their hopes to be fulfilled

105
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,958
by the enticing mystery box.

106
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,500
For a small financial charge,
you can chase your dreams!

107
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,291
Yes! That's brilliant, Master!

108
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,250
I'd like to try my luck too,
but I don't have any money!

109
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,750
Glad to hear it, Ako!
That's the spirit I want!

110
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,125
And to reward your enthusiasm,

111
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,250
I shall contribute
to your account!

112
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,333
Really? I'd like
to give it a go too!

113
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,875
Don't you knuckleheads
have any pride at all?

114
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,708
I just wanna open one up
out of a sense of curiosity.

115
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,041
Whatever items it gives me,
I swear to hand over to Master.

116
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,375
It looks like your wife is
planning on helping herself.

117
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,833
[HIDEKI]
Come on, Ako!

118
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,166
I don't remember
the woman I married

119
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,875
having such a greedy
look in her eyes.

120
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,250
I know. I surprised myself,

121
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,083
but these mystery
boxes are so alluring.

122
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,041
[KYOH]
There! Purchase complete.

123
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,166
Prepare to have your
minds blown, people!

124
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,708
It's time for our club's hundred
mystery box tradition!

125
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,333
[HIDEKI, AKO]
Yeah!

126
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,083
Hold on! You can't just make
up ludicrous new traditions!

127
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,000
[AKO sighs]

128
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,166
[AKO] Well that was
extra disappointing.

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,333
I can't believe I didn't
get a single rare item.

130
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,666
Totally.

131
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,791
Not getting a single rare
drop after all the boxes

132
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,541
you went through in itself
is an achievement.

133
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,958
Yeah, well,

134
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,250
it's no different from
everything else in my dumb life.

135
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,333
It's like I always roll critical
fail in everything I do.

136
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,541
Hey, don't sweat it.

137
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,083
Everybody is pretty
under-leveled

138
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,541
in the game of life.

139
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,875
The game of life is total
suckware. I just wanna quit.

140
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,958
Let's keep going just a
bit longer, all right?

141
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,166
Oh, I know!

142
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,916
How 'bout some ice cream
to lighten the mood?

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,125
Sure! Uh...

144
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,791
But I can't pay. I forgot
my wallet at home.

145
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,583
[HIDEKI]
Thanks! Have a good one!

146
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,333
Here.

147
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,583
Good morning.

148
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,375
Good morning!
What's up, Rusian?

149
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,291
[grumbles]

150
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,541
Hey, dude.

151
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,416
Isn't your girlfriend
gonna come say hello?

152
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,458
[HIDEKI groans]

153
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,000
I thought I already
told you guys,

154
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,208
Ako isn't my girlfriend.

155
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,958
Yeah. We know.
She's just your wife.

156
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,416
[TAKAZAKI] I'm not tryin'
to sound like a hater,

157
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,083
but drop dead, you ingrate.

158
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,500
[MAKUNOUCHI]
We hope you get food poisoning.

159
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,333
Thanks for your input, morons.

160
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,791
Good morning, Segawa.

161
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,583
Sorry about that, Nishimura.

162
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,291
Akane had been in
a really good mood

163
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,250
up until about a minute ago.

164
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:41,083
Hey, it's no problem.
She's always like that.

165
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,666
Friggin' Nishimura.

166
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,708
He's already got a girl, and now
he's getting friendly with her?

167
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,458
That insensitive,
two-timing jerk.

168
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,625
Guys, somebody's gotta
tell his poor hot wife.

169
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,625
[AKO]
I see you.

170
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,291

00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,500
[yelps]

172
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,083
[AKANE]
Ready for some fun today?

173
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,500
Keep treating me right,
darling War Machine.

174
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,625
[HIDEKI] War Machine?
What's that all about?

175
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,416
That's the name I've given
my sweet little gaming rig.

176
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,458
My smooth-running good girl.

177
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,541
She's so great.
I wanna take her home!

178
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,166
I can't allow that.

179
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,875
The club's PCs are all
officially school property.

180
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,916
Ugh. Stingy.

181
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,083
Hey, you're late.

182
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,416
Cleric needs food badly!

183
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,458
Rusian!

184
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,291
You've gotta cast heal on me!

185
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,541
[HIDEKI]
You're the healer, doofus.

186
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,041
Wait, did something
happen to you?

187
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,541
Over the last few weeks,

188
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,875
I've come to visit you a lot,
haven't I, Rusian?

189
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,500
That's got some of the
other girls in my class talking.

190
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,291
Hey, Tamaki, I've noticed
you've been hanging out

191
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,250
in the class next door
a whole lot lately.

192
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,500
Why's that?

193
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,500
[GIRL B gasps]

194
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,541
Are you going to
see your boyfriend

195
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,708
or something like that?

196
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,166
What? You've got
a new boyfriend?

197
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,500
What's he like? Is he tall?

198
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,125
It was awful. They were so mean!

199
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,708
No, they weren't.

200
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,583
Some girls get excited by all
of that relationship nonsense.

201
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,958
You use that as a jumping off
point in a conversation,

202
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,083
then you make new friends.

203
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,625
Oh.

204
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,208
Like the way I talk openly in
class about being an otaku.

205
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,375
Sure.

206
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,916
You can always say
"my boyfriend's great,"

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,250
and bask in the lukewarm
glow of his adequacy.

208
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,333
'Course, if I were you,

209
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,833
I'd disavow knowledge
of him entirely.

210
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,416
[HIDEKI] Better yet,
just leave me out of it.

211
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,375
My HP can't take the random
sniping from the other guys.

212
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,958
You misunderstand!

213
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,166
I'm not trying to conceal
the fact that Rusian and I

214
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,708
are made for each other!

215
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,875
In all honesty, I wish everyone
knew our tale of true love!

216
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,666
If that's the case,
I don't see your problem.

217
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,500
[HIDEKI] Wishes like that
are definitely a problem!

218
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,666
It was the way those girls
started talking to me,

219
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,166
after all the time I spent
establishing that I'm a loner.

220
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,041
It's like they had
no manners at all!

221
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,791
[HIDEKI]
That's what's bothering you?

222
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,458
[AKO] I had my "anti-other"
barrier activated,

223
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,083
but they kept
pushing against it.

224
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,791
--Tells us all the deets!
--What's his hair like?

225

--[AKO screams]
--Does he have a brother?

226
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,291
[GIRLS] Girl stuff,

[whimpers]

228
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,083
What do I do?

229
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,083
Yeah. What do you do?

230
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,750
Don't look at me.

231
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,666
I don't have any real experience
in this particular field.

232
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,250
After all, in my class,

233
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,541
even though I never
put up a barrier,

234
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,875
no one talks to me.

235
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,041
[HIDEKI]
Oh.

236
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,250
[knocking]

237
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,541
[HIDEKI]
Come in?

238
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,125
[gasps]

239
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,708
Nanako?

240
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,458
[NANAKO]
I knew it!

241
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,833
So, uh, what brings you
all the way out here?

242
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,125
[giggles] I came looking
for you, Akane!

243
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,958
Well... you found me.

244
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,583
[NANAKO] I saw you make
sure no one was watching

245
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,833
before you walked in here,

246
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,375
so I thought I'd check it out.

247
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,083
Is this a computer club?

248
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:02,666
Yes.

249
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,791
No! Maybe.

250
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,250
This is where the
Modern Communications

251
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,041
Electronic Game Club
comes to meet.

252
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,125
Though we just call it
the Net Game Club.

253
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,500
Why would you tell her that?
Is nothing here a secret?!

254
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,416
I hate you so much right now!

255
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,708
What the devil's gotten you
so worked up, Sir Schwein?

256
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,875
[AKANE whines]

257
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,416
Sir Schwein?

258
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,541
[AKANE] What's it gonna take
to get you to stop calling me

259
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,166
by my game name in front
of other people?

260
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,708
[NANAKO]
So <i>Legendary Age</i> is a game?

261
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,791
And, uh, you like, play this
game as part of your club?

262
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,625
Yeah, I guess that's
the long and short of it.

263
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,875
Shut up, Rusian!

264
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,166
[NANAKO] So you call
him Rusian too, Akane?

265
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
Is that like, a nickname the
other club members gave him?

266
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,250
No! No!

267
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,541
I'm not in it,
so how would I know?

268
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,333
[NANAKO]
Then what're you doing here?

269
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,041
Uh.

270
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,458
A good question!

271
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,333
I'm standing guard to keep nice,
normal people like you

272
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,750
from getting tainted by the nerd
vibe emanating from this room

273
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,416
like the broadcast
of the damned.

274
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,000
So out you go! Now move it!

275
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,041
Get out! Leave!

276
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,166
[NANAKO]
Whoa, hold on Akane--

277
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,000
It's all over.

278
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,083
My life as a cool high
school girl. It's over.

279
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,000
Where are Schew and Master?
They're running late.

280
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,500
I don't know about Master,

281
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,791
but Schew may not
be joining us today.

282
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,541
[AKO] Yeah, she was a total
wreck after what happened.

283
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,958
Oh man. I can't sit
around waiting like this.

284
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,083
It's boring me to death.

285
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,833
[AKO gasps]

286
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,416
I know!

287
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,625
Are you ready to have some fun?

288
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,958
Yes!

289
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,250
--[RUSIAN] Yeah!
--[AKO] Woohoo!

290
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,333
[AKO, RUSIAN laughing]

291
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,458
[RUSIAN] I can't believe how
much we've gotten done already.

292
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,458
Between the airship cruise,
the undersea temple,

293
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,833
the whale launch, and touring
the mechanical city...

294
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,500
Heck, we even went on
the sightseeing course

295
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,125
the devs put in for newbies!

296
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,375
It's almost as if we're
finally taking our honeymoon!

297
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,041
Actually, it feels
more like a date.

298
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,791
[gasps]

299
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,125
So it is a date?

300
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,458
Ah! No! Don't read too
much into my word choice!

301
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,291
Just the two of us walking
arm in arm like this.

302
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,000
It makes me think of
the first time we met.

303
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,041
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

304
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,291
I was being attacked
by horrific monsters.

305
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,250
Then you swooped in, Rusian,
like my own Prince Charming!

306
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,625
Are you unhurt, Miss?

307
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,375
What? That's not how
things went down at all!

308
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,250
You were flailing around like a
newb loser stuck in a tornado.

309
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,250
And I remember asking
if you were okay.

310
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,833
Then you said...

311
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,791
Um... I'm new to the game,

312
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,833
and I don't know
how to make it end.

313
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,750
[RUSIAN] So I told you
how to log out properly.

314
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,916
Then starting the next day,

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you followed me around
everywhere I went.

316
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,625
Which has been the case
up to this point.

317
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,583
And that's the truth.

318
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,958
[RUSIAN screams]

319
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,791
Well, of course! And you can
chalk it all up to love!

320
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,458
Don't justify your
stalker behavior

321
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,833
by mislabeling it as love!

322
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,416
The husband doubts the weight
of his wife's affection.

323
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,166
Honestly, I can't
remember the last time

324
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
there was enough room
to have a doubt.

325
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,250
The weight of your love is
so heavy it's crushing me.

[AKO gasps]

327
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,208
[RUSIAN]
Huh? What's wrong?

328
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,125
What is this place?

329
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,583
You know, the whole time
I've played the game,

330
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,333
I've never once been
inside the inn.

331
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,875
[RUSIAN]
Well, it's not a real deal inn.

332
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,250
It's just set up
to look like one.

333
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,291
And resting here doesn't even

334
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,750
restore your strength
or anything.

335
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,333
[AKO]
That's pretty weird.

00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,291
[AKO]
Someone's in this room.

337
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,291
Yeah, go figure.

338
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,291
Why do you suppose those
two are on the bed

339
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,541
facing each other like that?

340
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,000
[RUSIAN]
Uh...

341
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,208
I think I get it!

342
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,166
A young couple on a bed
together in a quaint inn

343
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,291
full of ambiance?

344
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,708
What could be more clear?

345
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,250
I don't think that's
our business.

346
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,291
[AKO] There's something I've
been thinking about for a while.

347
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,875
You're always saying
that the game and life

348
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,833
are separate, Rusian,
but that logic goes both ways.

349
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,208
And that means that in the game,

350
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,583
you and I are a full-fledged
married couple.

351
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,791
[RUSIAN]
That's true.

352
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,500
[AKO] We've never
consummated our love,

353
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,416
but it's okay for us to do
what actual couples do

354
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,333
inside the game, isn't it?

355
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,791
I guess what I'm saying
is that I'm ready to engage

356
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,958
in some hot and heavy
chat messaging.

357
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,375
Are you joking?

358
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,708
This is our chance
to put into words

359
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,041
everything that we're
feeling for each other.

360
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,291
Rusian, your finger slowly
traces its way down my spine,

361
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,458
and the muscles down my back
melt with your sensual caress.

362
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,833
Stop!

363
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,708
If you say it out loud,
I might start imagining it!

364
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,000
I can't not think about it!

Hey. I'm really extra sorry.

It's fine. You just
can't say that stuff.

Is that you, Rusian?

Oh, Nekohime.

Now what, pray tell,

all the way out here?

373
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,833
Rusian took me out on a date!

374
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,916
Never mind her, and I
could ask you the same.

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,208
Oh, well, uh, I-I'm not
sure how to say this.

Who the hell are you?

What have you done?

You made Nekohime uncomfortable!

00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't think I did anything!

Oh, them?

They're all high-level
members of a guild

It had been a while since
I forged out on my own,

be nice to catch up.

you're the only knight
I'll ever need, Rusian.

There's so much here to take in.
What do I do next?

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,208
She's an eager new player.

425
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,333
I can't in good conscience
leave someone like her alone.

426
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,791
You aren't thinking
of looking after her

427
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,791
like some kind of
mentor, are you?

428
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,250
What choice do I have?

429
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,750
She's brand new and
doesn't know anything.

430
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,125
Well that may be true,
but I don't have to like it.

431
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,541
Hey, Sette. Have you
learned the basic controls?

432
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,250
Is that a no?

433
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:18,166
First thing's first, you're a
melee fighter. Same as me.

434
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,500
Same as you. Melee.

435
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,583
[RUSIAN] The fundamentals
are normal attacks,

436
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,250
guard, counter,
and smash attacks.

437
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,041
You have a couple
ranged attacks.

438
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,208
but you really shouldn't
rely on them.

439
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,875
Now, the process is
actually kinda simple.

440
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,083
You start by bashing them
with your normal attacks,

441
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,791
and when it looks like the
enemy's about to attack, guard.

442
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,458
If you think it's a melee
skill incoming, counter,

443
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,041
and when their guard is down,
smash the crap out of 'em!

444
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,333
Now, you're gonna want
to close the distance--

say anything to anyone.

It's only a matter of time
before someone else finds out,

so you better be careful!

way into the room.
