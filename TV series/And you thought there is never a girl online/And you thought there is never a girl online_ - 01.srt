May I ask why?

I swore to myself I would
never fall in love again.

I heard you, and
yet I dare to dream!

That's pretty tame,
as far as dares go.

we'll have even more fun!

How much did you drop on
that fancy staff of yours?

Actually, I think it was from
this little magic booster.

Then again, perhaps if
I had been quicker,

by giving me this gold ring

of your fumbling, Ako.

00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,291
after the last time
she proposed to me.

160
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,166
So, in this fantasy world,
I have a beautiful wife.

161
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,458
Which does not match my luck
with women in real life.

162
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,125
[HIDEKI] "I am now speaking
directly into your mind

163
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,750
so that we can have
a little privacy."

164
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,958
This is no time to be chatting
with the other guild members.

165
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,083
Instead, you should be paying
attention to your loving wife.

166
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:47,791
Your loving wife...

167
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,041
[RUSIAN]
Ako? Hello?

168
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,291
Man, she's always
doing things her way.

169
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,083
Seems like the two of you
are stuck together

170
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,333
like glue today, huh?

171
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,208
That's just 'cause Ako
won't leave me alone.

172
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,083
[SCHWEIN]
Heh. Like a couple of normies.

173
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,500
It's not in real life, okay?

174
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,958
It's just in the game,
you get me?

175
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,666
Hmm... Sure, I guess.

176
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,000
Now that I think of it,

177
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,250
I might be the biggest
normie in the whole group.

178
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,208
The other day, someone declared
their love for me in IRL.

179
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:10,958
For real?

180
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,541
[APRICOT chuckles]

181
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,375
[RUSIAN] Schew must be a real
looker. I always had a hunch.

182
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,750
I know I shouldn't be,
but I'm getting jealous!

183
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,041
[AKO
Wow, really, Schew?

184
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,375
[RUSIAN] Good-looking
guys can all piss off!

185
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,041
Why don't you shove off and die?

186
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,416
[SCHWEIN]
Huh?

187
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,666
Ako?

188
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,791
[AKO] Freaking normies
are the absolute worst.

189
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,416
And anybody who
gets confessed to

190
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,958
ought to just get
out of the game.

191
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,583
Just being close to one of them
makes me sick to my stomach.

192
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,375
And those are the people
who can die off.

193
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,583
They're nothing more than
a plague on the rest of us.

194
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,666
[chuckles]

195
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,208
I said no, you psycho!

196
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
This bad mamma-jamma ain't
got time for that stuff!

197
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,875
You're creepin' us
all out, calm down!

198
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,208
[chuckling]

199
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,750
[RUSIAN]
Hey, Ako, come back to us!

200
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,583
I freaking hate
normie losers too,

201
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,791
but you shouldn't take
it out on your guildmates.

202
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,708
Please forgive me, you guys.

203
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,208
Sure, but I get what you
were saying about normies.

204
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,625
I feel the same way as you.

205
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,708
By and large, I concur.

206
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,416
[GUYS sigh]

207
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,125
This guild is too
bent out of shape.

208
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,625
[APRICOT]
Mm-hmm.

209
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,625
[SCHWEIN] I don't know we've
enjoyed some peace and quiet

210
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,708
for a couple minutes now.

211
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,458
All right, fine!
I'll just say it!

212
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,250
Time after time, Rusian rejected
my love-filled proposals

213
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,958
to join together in the bliss
of digital matrimony!

214
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,625
The stress of it all
was shortening my life

215
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,750
like a D.O.T. bomb!

216
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,375
In the end, it all worked
out okay, didn't--?

217
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,916
[AKO]
But it's all about the journey!

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,666
I made ten proposals, and you
turned me down each time!

219
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,000
Ten times! Don't you have
any common decency?

220
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,541
[RUSIAN]
Hmm... Right, I get it.

221
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,375
What say we just
do a hard reset?

222
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,500
Start over from our
first conversation?

223
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,708
[thud]

224
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,041
I was only kidding,
my darling! I'm sorry!

225
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,625
Please don't divorce me,
I'm begging you! Have mercy...

226
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,166
Hey, why didn't you say yes
the first time she asked?

227
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,708
In-game marriages are dumb.

228
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,625
It's a role-playing mechanic
I could do without.

229
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,958
It's an online game!

230
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,458
Not the real,
flesh and blood world!

231
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,625
It's not like you have a shot

232
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,083
at getting married
in real life anyway.

233
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,708
Might as well go through
with it in-game.

234
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,458
So where do we draw
the line? With AI babes?

235
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,916
[AKO]
I know the real reason.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,750
Rusian once asked another player

237
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,541
to get married here
in the game world.

238
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,166
[screams]

239
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,875
He did?

240
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:08,750
Oh?

241
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,166
Ako, how could you say that?

242
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,833
I was trying to
keep that a secret!

243
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,291
[APRICOT] You have to
tell us now, obviously.

244
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,458
[RUSIAN]
I'm begging you, my lady.

245
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,500
Marry me. Give me thine hand.

246
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,750
I'm afraid you'll
have to count meow-t.

247
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,583
I swear, I am in love with you!

248
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,041
[NEKOHIME sighs]

249
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,416
[NEKOHIME] Sorry, but I'm
actually a guy in real life.

250
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,791
I'm a middle-aged dude.

251
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,791
At first I wanted to
ogle a sexy avatar,

252
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,458
but then I got caught up
in cross-playing.

253
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,916
[RUSIAN]
Huh?

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,166
I mean, what chick would say
"meow" puns in real life?

255
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,583
Not the kinda girl
you'd wanna date.

256
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,375
[RUSIAN, HIDEKI scream]

257
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,958
[HIDEKI]
Damn it! Damn it!

258
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,791
I swear, I will never
trust another girl

259
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,375
I meet on the net again!

260
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,500
For as long as I live!

261
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,958
[APRICOT, SCHWEIN laughing]

262
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,583
[RUSIAN] You guys don't
have to laugh that hard!

263
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,875
[SCHWEIN] That chapter of
your life is beyond dark.

264
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,833
Ah, the majesty of young love.

265
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,125
Fart-knockers.

266
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,583
[RUSIAN]
The thing is, Nekohime,

267
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,500
the girl I first declared my
love to, was super cute,

268
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,875
had good taste
in equipment,

269
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,625
was nice to everyone she
played with and played well.

270
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,958
She was the ideal girl--
I mean, girl character.

271
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,708
The sheer shock of her
revelation was devastating.

272
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,750
To the point that I left
the guild I was with,

273
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,333
and for nearly a year after,

274
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,125
I stuck with solo
play exclusively.

275
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:47,500
Then, in my solitude,
I arrived at a certain truth.

276
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,375
Who cares as long
as they're cute!

277
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,541
Even if they are dudes in
real life, I don't care!

278
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,166
As long as they're cute in game.

279
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,041
Ultimately, it was the
cuteness in the game

280
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,833
I was enamored with.

281
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,166
Yes, I discovered the horrible
truth lurking on the web.

282
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,083
Rusian, are you mad at me?

283
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,458
For telling everyone
what happened

284
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,875
with you and the cat girl?

285
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,041
That kinda stuff happens
all the time, so don't worry.

286
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,833
Thank you so much, Rusian!

287
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,000
I love you.

288
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,583
[gasps]

289
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,833
Huh. Just calm down.
You gotta cool it, Hideki.

290
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,166
You know from experience that
if you take it too seriously,

291
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,083
you'll only regret it.

292
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,458
[APRICOT]
It makes sense.

293
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,916
Now I see why you were
so hesitant to agree.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,916
All this spouse stuff has
nothing to do with me

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,125
in real life,

296
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,833
but in the world of
the game, Ako is Ako.

297
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,541
Just so you know,
I actually am female.

298
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,166
Yeah, fine. If you
say so, then you are.

299
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,375
At least to you, that is.

300
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,875
No, no.

301
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,125
In real life, I'm a nerdy,
nose-in-her-book kind of girl.

302
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,708
[SCHWEIN]
Whoa, hold on.

303
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,500
You shouldn't admit something
like that in open chat, Ako.

304
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,541
It's the greatest
net taboo of all.

305
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,416
I had no idea.

306
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,291
Taboos are ludicrous.

307
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,375
I, for example, am a high
school girl in real life.

308
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,625
You, Master?
A high school girl?

309
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,833
With that premium gear?
Not a chance.

310
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:58,708
Impossible.

311
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,166
Seriously, no way.

312
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,750
I'm pouring my heart
out to my friends,

313
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,791

dressing to the occasion.

We're already good friends,

our bonds of friendship.

to the next level!

Your name, "Schwein,"

is actually the German
word for "pig."

ever choose "Pig" for a name?

00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,125
You should pick us up
in your minivan next time.

473
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,583
[HIDEKI]
Master, you too?

474
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,916
[AKANE] Like I already said,
I told the guy no.

475
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,541
I'm not interested in
going out with anyone.

476
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,333
I've been told that
Maeda from Class 3

477
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,583
is pretty popular
with the ladies.

478
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,833
Is he just not your type?

479
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,291
[AKANE]
I-It's not that.

480
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,583
If I had a dumb boyfriend,

481
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,291
it would cut into my time
playing video games.

482
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,833
[HIDEKI]
That's why you turned him down?

483
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,208
You wouldn't seriously want
something like that, would you?

484
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,500
Definitely not for me.

485
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,708
I'd turn him down.

486
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,833
You genuinely would
rather play video games?

487
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,791
[AKANE] Damn straight.
You got a problem with that?

488
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,125
Nope.

489
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,041
I definitely prefer this
to who you are at school.

490
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,791
I don't think I should take
that statement as a compliment.

491
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,041
[AKO] I may have an idea
to turn that around!

492
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,166
So, Schew, have you ever
considered getting married

493
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,708
in the game?

494
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,083
Rusian and I did, and we've
been having fun ever since!

495
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,166
You wouldn't lose any
gaming time that way.

496
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,125
Plus, you'd be spending time
with the one you love.

497
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,416
It's a total twofer!

498
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,791
I think I'll pass, thanks.
It sounds gross.

499
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,416
[HIDEKI]
That's mean!

500
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,041
I think it's a great idea!

501
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,833
Right, Rusian?

502
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,916
Yeah, but I can still
hardly believe it myself.

503
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,250
[AKO]
Huh?

504
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,250
[HIDEKI]
Ako, you're so...

505
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,291
I have a living, breathing
girl as my 2D wife.

506
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,708
Oh, Rusian!

507
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,333
[AKO] Are you trying
to humiliate me?

508
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,958
Lately, it's been frowned
on for the heroine

509
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,500
to be too forward
in Episode One,

510
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,625
but you're taking it too far
the other way, Rusian!

511
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,500
[HIDEKI]
I'm not the heroine here!
