1
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:44,041
[KYOH] Remember, you guys,
this battle is our final chance.

2
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,791
Our objective is to
capture the fort

3
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,291
and hold it until the
siege timer runs out.

4
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,083
It's still under the control
of Guild Wallenstein.

5
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,708
We're going to take
it back from them.

6
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,291
Aren't we setting the
hurdle kinda high?

7
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,625
[HIDEKI] Actually, I don't think
it'll be that big of a problem.

8
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,333
They probably won't
even be in the fort.

9
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,708
What makes you think that?

10
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,500
He said as much in front
of us, that Bats guy.

11
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,500
Playing defensively
isn't any fun.

12
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,625
Conquering a player who's
desperately defending something

13
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,791
is much more entertaining.

14
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,583
[HIDEKI]
Those are his words.

15
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,166
I can't believe you would
even talk to that jerk

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,541
after he and his cronies
stabbed our guild in the back!

17
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,125
I can.

18
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,791
It's just like you two to endear
yourselves to that Alpha Geek.

19
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,416
[HIDEKI]
"You two" my pixelated butt!

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,875
It was Ako that was endearing.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,875
[gasps]

22
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,833
But talking to him
was your idea!

23
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,250
So does that mean it should
be easy to take the fort?

24
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,083
Not necessarily.

25
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,666
I highly doubt
we're the only guild

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,041
planning to lay siege to it.

27
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,583
Capturing it is easy.

28
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,875
Defending it until the timer
runs out is the difficult part.

29
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,250
Which we had to learn
the hard way last time, huh?

30
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,583
Attacking and defending?
Bring it on!

31
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,583
I'll show off the results
of my practice!

32
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,708
Our real problem
is the end game.

33
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,458
If we're successful...

34
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,958
...they'll come again.

35
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:55,666
[KYOH] Mm. Which means PvP
versus the masters, Wallenstein.

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,666
And I, for one, am looking
forward to some payback.

37
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,958
That's strange.

38
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
I thought Phine would've
shown up for this.

39
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,166
He had to attend his
kid's field day.

40
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,458
Huh? Does that mean I'm the
only tank in the entire group?

41
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,958
[KYOH]
Welcome to all.

42
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm beyond grateful that so many
of you have come together

43
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,291
to aid us in our time of need.

44
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,791
Now with our forces combined,
we in Guild Alley Cats,

45
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,083
with our comrades in
Nekohime's Elite Guard,

46
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,041
for this battle
shall be known as:

47
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,333
Alley Cat-Princess Elite Guard!

48
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,958
[groans]

49
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,791
Seriously?

50
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,875
We stand with Nekohime!

51
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,041
I see what they did.

52
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,166
"Nekohime" translates
to "Cat-Princess."

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
You just put that together?

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,416
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Attention!

55
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,583
The siege warfare event
is now under way!

56
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,583
Sweet! I'm fired up!

57
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,458
Yeah!

58
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,500
Let's go do our best, Mu-tan!

59
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,000
[KYOH] May the victory we claim
here echo throughout eternity!

60
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,041
Alley Cat-Princess
Elite Guard! Move out!

61
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,125
[ELITE GUARD cheers]

62
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,333
[YUYUN]
The enemy got here first!

63
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,791
There're over 30 of them!

64
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,125
Emperor Sword, huh?

65
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,791
That's the same guild
that we took the fort from

66
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,833
the first time.

67
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,791
When did Yuyun get here?

68
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,541
[YUYUN]
I've been here!

69
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,791
They got in before we could.

70
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,791
[KYOH] Switch from defensive
posture to attack formation!

71
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's take that fort!

72
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,958
Guess I'll go get the
siege weapons ready!

73
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,458
Good. Go.

74
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,083
Blast 'em!

75
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,000
Into the breach!

76
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:31,041
[ELITE GAURD yelling]

77
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,083
For the glory of our Mistress!

78
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,000
Drive the enemy out of here!

79
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,625
Kill! Kill!

80
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,958
Bring me their leader and we'll
stick his ugly head on a pike!

81
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,583
Damn... Can't break through!

82
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,791
We seem to be short
on teammates!

83
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,541
Gi! Move out!

84
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,500
Melee Gi, move out!

85
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,541
Decoy Gi, move out!

86
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,791
Transport Gi, move out!

87
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,375
That's a whole buncha robots!

88
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,375
None of which we need right now!

89
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,125
We're out of material!

90
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,875
We're gonna need more people
on the resource gathering team!

91
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,833
Too many gis and
not enough fighters!

92
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,541
Sette's overachieving is
starting to work against us!

93
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,083
[HIDEKI] Damn it!
They're not breaking rank!

94
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,458
We don't have enough tanks!

95
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,625
If we could just get an
opening for a half a second!

96
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,458
So you need an opening?

97
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,083
Okay then.

98
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,166
Hey, guys! Hang in there
a little bit longer!

99
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,791
The Black Magician is on
his way here now to help us!

100
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,375
[SETTE]
Oops! Wrong crowd.

101
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,000
So that was open chat.

102
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,416
Well come on, guys, why
don't you say something too?

103
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,291
[RUSIAN]
Not true. You're mistaken.

104
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,208
TMW's definitely not coming!

105
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,208
That's more fighting for us!

106
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,166
Okay! That's your opening!

107
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,166
Uh? It is?

108
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,958
Hurry up!

109
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,708
[ALL laughing]

110
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,958
[EMPEROR SWORD A]
Yeah, as if!

111
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,416
[EMPEROR SWORD B]
That's not even plausible!

112
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
[EMPEROR SWORD C] You guys
trying to bluff is too cute!

113
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,041
[AKANE]
You're mine! Take this!

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,791
Hog-wild attack!

115
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,916
It's almost like I died
and went to hog heaven!

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,958
If I strike twice,
I'm one shot ahead!

117
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,000
That's how you rock bad
mamma-jamma style!

118
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,875
See? You got through just fine!

119
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,583
How did you know they'd be
distracted while replying?

120
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,625
What if she turns that
sorcery against us?

121
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,916
Exploit the opening!
Push forward!

122
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,291
[KYOH] Come back for the
stronger opponents later!

123
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,250
For now, make sure to pick
off the weaker ones!

124
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,791
That's brutal.

125
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,583
[AKANE]
Slice and dice!

126
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,166
I'm putting it in.

127
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,125
[ANNOUNCER] Fort Cantor has
now come under the control

128
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,458
of Guild Alley Cats.

129
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,958
--All right!
--We did it!

130
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,458
This is way more satisfying
than the last time!

131
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,708
Sure is!

132
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,583
Keep an eye out.
We'll be defending right away.

133
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,583
[HIDEKI]
Twenty minutes left.

134
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,708
If we can defend
against this--

135
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,250

You're our mage!
What're you doing out front?

Remember, Ako!
Just keep your eyes on me!

to be looking for?

[KYOH]
For me to do this!

higher than normal!

Behold.

I max out my attack power!

Uh! Thanks!

155

The timing was spot on.

00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,166
I think I got my extra
damage buff in there too.

157

Come on.
This was Ako's moment.

Only ten minutes remaining.

159

Just about time.

What's the enemy breakdown?

163
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,125
[YUYUN]
Five players approaching.

164
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,958
It's Wallenstein.

165
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,291
They're here.

166
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,250
I knew you'd be coming,
Bats. Tough news.

167
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,250
We'll defend to the last man.

168
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,666
Now's the time!

169
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,541
What say we show these
turncoats what we're made of?

170
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,958
[ELITE GUARD]
Oh, yeah!

171
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,541
Rusian's squad, maintain
the second defensive line!

172
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,958
You got it!

173
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,375
Schwein's squad is on
standby in the inner courtyard.

174
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,208
If they get past Rusian's squad,
you come to greet them!

175
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,666
Gladly!

176
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,000
Here they come! Fire!

177
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,916
[yells]

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,541
Now, Schwein!

179
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,458
All right, guys! It's go time!

180
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,166
They know what you're doing!

181
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,000
Doesn't matter now!

182
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,041
[yells]

183
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,958
Damn! This battle's hopeless!

184
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,166
[AKANE]
It's not hopeless. Not yet!

185
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,291
Whoa, don't those white elixirs

186
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,750
go for like 500
freakin' K per potion?

187
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,083
How many did you take?

188
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,708
Enough to teach them a lesson!

189
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,625
I'm gonna show these jerks
I'm done messing around!

190
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,875
[AKANE]
Blade dance!

191
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,958
[growls]

192
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,958
I gave it everything
I had there.

193
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess I'm not as useful
as I thought I was.

194
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,375
That's ridiculous!
You're our MVP!

195
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,333
Two minutes left?

196
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,750
We've got time to spare.

197
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,083
You dirty bastard.

198
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,291
Well then, do your worst!

199
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,666
Oh, hey there, Mr. Bats!

200
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
Oh, crap. We wasted
our cooldown skills!

201
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,583
Niaow! Crush these clowns!

202
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,833
[SETTE] Hey, Bats, you ever
hear of "bait and switch"?

203
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,208
'Cause you just fell for it!

204
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,166
Shut up, you scrub!

205
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,125
[RUSIAN]
He's stunned!

206
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,833
That's two of 'em down!
Only three more to go, guys!

207
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,958
Another one bites the dust!

208
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,916
I regret nyao-thing!

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
[BOTH gasp]

210
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,208
You bastard!!

211
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,166
Time to die!

212
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,583
Hiya.

213
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,125
Tank-on-tank action?
No one has the advantage!

214
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,791
Oh yeah.

215
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,250
My stun is about the only thing
with a chance of stopping Bats!

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,375
Outta my way!

217
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,708
You've gotta hurry up!

218
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,583
You're the only one who
can keep our crystal safe!

219
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,416
I know, but I can't
get past this guy!

220
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,708
Never fear...
for Apricot is here.

221
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,083
[BATS] One minute left,
and one person in my way.

222
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,541
Ha! This is gonna be too easy!

223
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,083
That chat left you
with 55 seconds.

224
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,125
Looks like somebody needs
to work on his typing speed!

225
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,125
Master!

226
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,291
Huh?

227
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,958
[KYOH chuckles]

228
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,291
Hang on. How are you
even still alive?

229
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,708
I can't believe it's working!

230
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,458
Whatever happens,
keep spamming that hotkey!

231
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,541
I need some help!

232
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,500
Come here! This one's trouble!

233
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,916
I need you to throw
a stun, Koro!

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,541
Ain't gonna happen!

235
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,833
Damn it!

236
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,041
Watch out, Master!

237
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,083
A stun's coming!
You gotta move!

238
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,750
I will not run!

239
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,708
If they get through,
then it's all over!

240
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,666
[RUSIAN]
But you'll die!

241
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,000
Not on my watch!

00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,916
[AKO]
Peep-peep.

[BATS]
Out of my way!

244
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,541
Perfect timing, Ako!

245
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,791
Great job! Ako, you rock!

246
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,041
[HIDEKI, SAITO chuckle]

247
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,125
Why're you all so happy?
That guy just killed me!

248
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,708
[RUSIAN]
Let's dance!

249
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,833
[RUSIAN] Master, come on!
It's now or never!

[laughing]

251
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,250
Is that all you've got, Bats?
How very disappointing.

252
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,375
[BATS] Come on!
Just die already, dammit!

253
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,666
[RUSIAN, AKO, AKANE]
Three. Two. One.

254
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,166
Time's up!

255
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,750
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Today's siege warfare event

256
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,000
has now come to an end.

257
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,208
[BATS]
You've gotta be kidding.

258
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,583
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
The victors of the siege event

259
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,000
are as follows:

260
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,791
TMW have now been instated
as the lords of Lodestone.

261
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,750
The Aristocrats have
now been instated

262
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:40,791
as the lords of the
great citadel of Gramberg.

263
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,666
The Cleaning Crew
have now been instated

264
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,541
as the lords of the mighty
Templar Fortress of Ray Sword.

265
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,333
The Alley Cats have
now been instated

266
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,875
as the lords of Fort Cantor.

267
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,250
[cheers]

268
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,375
We won!

269
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,583
I'm so happy!

270
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,375
Well done!

271
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,083
In your face, Wallenstein!

272
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,541
Right in your dumb faces!

273
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,583
Lady Nekohime is victorious!

274
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,708
All glory unto our cat goddess!

275
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,458
Great work! I really
admire myew fellas!

276
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,333
[RUSIAN]
We made it!

277
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,375
[AKANE]
Well done, soldiers!

278
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,916
Gi! Powered by Mu-tan!

279
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,250
He'd just pull bigger mobs.

280
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,875
[KYOH] We fought for it,
and now the fort is all ours!

281
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,291
[ELITE GUARD cheering]

282
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you crazy? You have
any idea what you've done?

283
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,458
What's the matter,
you a sore loser?

284
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,958
I didn't lose.

285
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,750
Every time I hit you, you used
a Drop of Ygg, didn't you?

286
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,083
Wait, what're you saying?
You mean a Drop of Yggdrasil?

287
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,500
Those are ten mil a piece!

288
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,375
[BATS]
How many of 'em did you use?

289
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,791
Let's see.

290
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,791
I started the battle with
500 hundred of them

291
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,083
and now I have 13 left.

292
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,458
I guess we won by a
really narrow margin.

293
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,583
You really drank
that many potions?

294
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,083
Taking over this castle doesn't
even net you five million.

295
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,625
What are you,
some kind of idiot?

296
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,541
He's got a point. How'd you
even end up with so much money?

297
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,208
It would take years to earn that
much just by killing monsters.

298
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,791
It's quite simple, actually.

299
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,375
I sold off the items
in my inventory

300
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,625
that I didn't need anymore.

301
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,166
Stuff you didn't need?

302
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,791
There's no way that would've
even come close to enough.

303
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,875
All I had to do was sell
the rest of my mystery boxes

304
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,625
and the premium items
that came with them.

305
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,666
In other words... real money.

306
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,375
That's a full-blown RMT,
you raging weirdo!

307
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,291
I never violated the
terms of use. How rude.

308
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,833
How many tens of
thousands did you spend?

309
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:24,833
[KYOH chuckles]

310
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,791
I got everything
for a single coin.

311
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,333
[BATS]
Like hell you did.

312
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,666
It's all true, Bats,
whether you believe it or not.

313
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,166
It wouldn't matter if
I had to spend millions.

314
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,958
If it helped out my friends,
it was but one coin to me.

315
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,416
[laughing]

316
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,750
That's a terrible
waste of money.

317
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,333
You're wrong.

318
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,041
This was easily the second most
beneficial financial transaction

319
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,166
I've ever been involved in.

320
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,208
This one really is crazy!
But I like that! Respect!

321
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,125
[HIDEKI] I guess Master endears
herself to weirdos too.

322
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,625
That's not exactly a compliment.

323
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,750
So it was real money after all.

324
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,625
I suppose a leopard can't change
its spots, can it, Master?

325
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,041
One thing I don't get.

326
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,000
What's that?

327
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,583
About what you told him,

328
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,333
how this was the second
most beneficial use

329
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,291
of your money so far.

330
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,000
So what was the first?

331
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,291
[chuckles]

332
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,333
I'm surprised you have to ask.

333
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,916
The best use of my money so far

334
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,208
was when I bought
my partner here.

335
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,333
[HIDEKI]
Whaddaya say?

336
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,458
You charged in head first
and got hacked to pieces.

337
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,458
Any regrets?

338
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,708
No way! I don't regret a thing!

339
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,750
I'm happy I actually tried!

340
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,000
[HIDEKI]
That's great!

341
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,000
Now it's time for the
culture festival itself!

342
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,708
You got this!

343
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,958
[yelps]

344
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,250
[STUDENT A]
Uhh... what's with this?

345
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,541
Hey, it's looking
pretty busy, isn't it?

346
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,166
Compared to some of the
school's other clubs,

347
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,708
I don't think our turnout is
anything to really brag about.

348
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, well.

349
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,583
But still,

350
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,875
this screengrab will always be
something for us to be proud of.

351
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,166
Yo!

352
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, at least our club had
a better time prepping

353
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,500
for the culture festival
than the other kids did.

354
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,416
Try not to get too chummy with
me when we're at school, 'kay?

355
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,041
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,750
[AKANE sighs]

357
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,708
[AKANE] I never would've thought
from the first day of school

358
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,000
you and I would ever end up
talking like this, you know?

359
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,500
You're saying this now?

360
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,000
We chat normally in the club
or in the game all the time.

361
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,083
It's like you said: The game
and reality are different.

362
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,541
Here.

363
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,875
Oh, thanks.

364
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,166
You did well today,

365
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,333
so consider this an award
for fighting spirit.

366
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,416
You're eating grilled
pork like a cannibal.

367
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,125
[AKANE]
Hardee-har, wise guy!

368
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,416
You gonna see the
other club displays?

369
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,083
No, I think I'll skip 'em.

370
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,416
Besides, you're going to check
out Ako's room, right?

371
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,375
[HIDEKI]
Uh-huh.

372
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,625
Throw it away when you're done.

373
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,750
Thank you!

374
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,750
I guess I'll see you around.

375
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,958
Partner.

376
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,375
[TAKASAKI]
Yo, Nishimura!

377
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,625
You sure took your time.

378
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,000
It's maid-o-clock, bro!

379
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,958
[AKO screams]

380
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,083
I just can't take it anymore!

381
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,291
Hey, Ako!

382
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,500
Hi, Rusian.

383
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,750
I don't think you're
supposed to run away.

384
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,458
I know, but--

385
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,708
Come on, get back in there.

386
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,666
Welcome to our maid café,
my darling!

387
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,458
I don't think that's the kinda
thing a maid usually says.

388
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,083
Aw, who am I kidding?.

389
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,291
Ako's not just some maid.

390
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,916
She's my wife.

391
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,875
This isn't fair. Why aren't
Master and the others

392
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,041
helping us clean
all of this junk up?

393
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,500
It's all right.
I think it's kinda fun!

394
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,041
Yeah.

395
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,875
So hey, this whole regular
school life thing

396
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,291
isn't so bad, is it?

397
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,958
No. It's okay I guess.

398
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,083
But that's only because
I get to be here with you,

399
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,000
and Schwein, and Master.

400
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:05,583
The whole Net Game Club
makes it all worthwhile.

401
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,125
[HIDEKI]
Still, I'm proud of you

402
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,166
for hanging in there during
the culture festival.

403
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,833
[AKO] Thanks!
I'm kinda proud of me too!

404
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,500
[HIDEKI] You were even
the café's head maid.

405
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,208
[AKO]
Please don't remind me.

406
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,458
[laughs]

407
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,666
Well I think you did
a pretty good job, Ako.

408
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,125
[AKO] Good enough to give me
some kind of reward?

409
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,375
[HIDEKI]
Sure. Anything you want.

410
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,625
[gasps]

411
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,750
You just said I could have
anything I wanted!

412
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,208
Hold on!

413
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,125
By reward, I meant some epic
item acquired in the game!

414
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,833
Big news, you guys!

415
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,791
This next update's gonna
feature player housing!

416
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,166
We're not interrupting
anything, are we?

417
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,666
Uh-huh.

418
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,208
[AKANE groans]

419
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,125
War Machine doesn't need to see
whatever you guys are doing.

420
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,958
No, no, it wasn't like that!

421
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,833
Uh! But you said you'd give me
whatever I wanted for a reward!

422
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,250
Hey, hang on!

423
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,750
No indecent behavior on
school grounds, you guys!

424
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,958
It's not!

425
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,333
I told you, your reward
has to be something

426
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,750
from in the game, okay?

427
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,833
It's the same thing either way
as far as I'm concerned.

428
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,625
[HIDEKI] It's not
the same thing at all!

429
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,541
The game and reality
are completely separate!

430
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:36,541
[AKO] But it doesn't
have to be that way!
