What? I must find him!

[grunting]

00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:06.875
Come back, Iruma! Don't be shy!

00:24:06.917 --> 00:24:08.083
Let grandpa dearest
give you a ride.

00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:10.042
You don't have to do this,
Grandpa, really!

00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.625
[NARRATOR] He might've
actually stood out less

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:13.333
if he'd just gotten
on the carriage.

That's the president? No fair.

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:20.208
How dare she snag all that
playtime with Iruma-kins?

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.333
I wanna fully,
smooshingly play with him, too!

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:27.208
Hmm! How do I get my comfy,
perfect playtime with him back?

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.958
Jelly, jelly,
peanut butter jelly.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.458
Is this jealousy?

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.583
I hope you're prepared,
Iruma-kins.

00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:37.750
I'm gonna wrap you
around my pinky finger

00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:38.917
and make you fall for me.
