Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

One day, he found himself

in the program.

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.542
[chuckles]

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:43.208
It was a surprise,
like I said.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.917
-Right, Professor Kalego?
-[KALEGO] Yes.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.333
Whatever happens,
we're not going

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:50.042
to let this ruin the party.

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:51.958
I'll make sure to get
the New Magic Battler

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.083
and the Game Battler
on the same page a bit later.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.875
Nothing to worry about!

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.625
[KALEGO] Hmm. That's an
acceptable stopgap measure.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.708
We don't want mass confusion
among the students.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.083
-However...
-[pulsing]

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.000
All teachers
in the central plaza,

00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:10.542
organize the students
who show up and take roll.

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:12.167
-Roger that, sir.
-Yis, sir.

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:14.292
[KALEGO] The rest of you,
try to figure this out.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.167
Sir!

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:17.708
And go!

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.667
[croaking]

00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:21.708
Newbie, aid me.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.958
Yes, sir.
How can I be of service?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.792
[laughs]
Wow!

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:29.542
Documents for days!

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:33.375
[KALEGO] All there is to know
about Babyls lives in here.

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:37.125
Anyone who can create a barrier
is a real suspect.

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:39.208
We're going to narrow
them down one by one.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.958
From all these? Really?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.208
Huh?

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.042
Come hither,
the goal's this way! Yis.

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:48.000
Yay! I think I'm
the first here!

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:49.250
[HARUNO/AZUKI/KONATSU]
Dosa!

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:51.500
Uh-huh.
Finally, we meet again.

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:53.458
I wonder what
our prize will be.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.375
Yeah!

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:55.625
Right this way.

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:56.875
No need to rush.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.708
[BOY 1]
Oh, you made it, too!

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.917
[BOY 2]
It was super easy.

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.625
[BOY 3]
This is the best surprise ever!

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.417
-[GIRL] Acchan!
-[BOY 4] Bakemi!

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.833
-Professor Blushenko.
-Hmm?

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:12.375
-We would like to assist you.
-[BLUSHENKO] Thank you.

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:14.292
Take care to keep
the others calm.

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:15.833
Yes, sir.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.458
Hey. Frowns upside down.

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:19.292
[ALL]
Devi!

00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:23.625
[BOY]
I wonder what the prize is?

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:25.375
I hope it's a ticket
to a waterpark.

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:27.708
I love the water!

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.708
They want us
to keep everyone calm?

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:32.708
Something is up, then.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.083
What could it be, though?

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:38.375
I wonder if Iruma
got through safely.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:41.458
[croaking]

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.583
[MOMONOKI]
Reporting.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.167
The entire school
is surrounded

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:48.500
by a huge barrier.

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:50.375
No in or out.

00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:52.958
Understood.
Thanks for updating.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.292
[MOMONOKI]
Y-yes, sir.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.958
[DALI] Professor Kalego.
Can you hear me?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.958
Yes, go ahead.

00:12:00.917 --> 00:12:02.167
It's no use.

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:04.750
We can't contact anyone
outside of Babyls.

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.708
The only way
we can use devi-comms

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.250
is inside
of the barrier itself.

00:12:09.292 --> 00:12:10.542
But we'll keep trying, though.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.875
Honestly, this is fun!

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:19.167
Yeah, I wonder what
they're planning to do next.

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:20.708
I'm getting so excited!

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:25.833
Surprises are important,
in life and in love.

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:30.083
After a quick count,
we estimate

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.083
about 80 percent
of the students are here.

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:34.542
Yes, and rather promptly, too.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:35.708
[KALEGO]
Eighty percent?

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.833
Highly suspect.

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:41.542
It's as though they wanted
everyone in the plaza, quickly.

00:12:49.792 --> 00:12:50.917
[chuckles]

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.708
It's lookin' good!

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.958
[beeping]

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.125
Uh-oh.

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:07.500
Where do you think
you're goin'?

00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:09.917
Aah!

00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.292
-Ow!
-Goober!

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.542
How about this way, then?

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.542
Let's get to the goal.

00:13:14.583 --> 00:13:17.167
[KIRIWO] Yup.
Now you've got it.

00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:20.167
Such good boys.
Yeah, there ya go.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.167
This is basically
a rat's maze.

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:28.625
If they go the wrong way,
I'll guide them...

00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:32.208
...until they're all
trapped together.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.958
I'm gonna be blowin'
all of you fools up

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.625
with flowers of light...

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.708
...watchin' from the best seat
in the house.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.375
I know you'll give it all
you've got... [snaps fingers]

00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:47.292
[machinery whirring]

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:48.375
...Gabuko.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:54.083
Or rather... School Destroyer.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.292
Up, now.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.500
Switch, on.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.333
[electricity crackling]

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:11.542
You and I are the only ones
here in this room.

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.333
No one else can come in--

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:15.875
[alarm beeping]

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:17.042
What in the...

00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:20.833
They're not headin'
to the central plaza.

00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:23.250
No, they're headin' straight
to this room!

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:26.208
Something's wrong.
They're too fast.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.000
They're gettin' through
the barrier gaps with ease.

00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:30.375
Who could do all this?

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:33.875
[panting]

00:14:33.917 --> 00:14:35.417
[IRUMA]
Just hang on, Kiriwo!

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.500
[alarm beeping]

00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:50.292
Oh yeah,
it must be Iruma.

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:53.750
I bet he's reacting
to my choker again.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.333
But wait,
I destroyed the stone.

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.625
He shouldn't be able
to track me down.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.458
So how is he doing this?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.167
[NARRATOR] To answer that,
we need to rewind a little.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.750
-Hmmm!
-Hmm?

00:15:09.792 --> 00:15:11.333
Did you find
a wall there, too?

00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:12.500
Not a one!

00:15:12.542 --> 00:15:14.750
Why do you complicate
everything?!

00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:15.792
-[IRUMA] Hey.
-[BOTH] Huh?

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.292
This barrier here...

00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:21.083
...isn't it one of Kiriwo's?

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:24.125
Hmm.

00:15:25.417 --> 00:15:27.292
Yes, it would indeed appear

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:29.667
that this magic
is the same as his.

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:31.250
No fair, Kiriyan!

00:15:31.292 --> 00:15:33.375
I wanna do a huge surprise
for the party, too!

00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:36.542
You twit. It's much more
complicated than that.

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:38.333
I'm coming to your side
right now.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.042
[grunts]

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.208
Time for Rolling Attack!

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.875
Ow. Owie.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:54.250
Oh no!
Are you okay, Clara?

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:56.125
To think someone
with his limited magic

00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:57.667
could put up
such a mighty barrier

00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:58.917
all over the school.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.250
Unbelievable.

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:03.333
If this was done solely
by Kiriwo,

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.625
who happens to be missing
at the moment,

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.792
it stands to reason
he's been carefully planning

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:10.083
this particular commotion
for years.

00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.458
Say what?
He planned a locomotion?

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.208
Hey, Azz, Clara.

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:17.458
I can't be sure,
but I think

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.417
there's one place
Kiriwo might've gone.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:21.167
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:22.917
[IRUMA] There's no guarantee
I'll get through the maze

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.417
and find it,

00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:26.000
but I'm worried about Kiriwo...

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.250
...so I need to know how to get
to the third-year tower.

00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:31.958
Can you help me?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.208
-But of course!
-Yup!

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.375
Valac, conjure a piece
of paper and pen.

00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:38.208
[CLARA]
You got it!

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.458
[chuckles]

00:16:42.417 --> 00:16:43.958
[ASMODEUS]
Now, then.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.917
Here's a rough sketch
of this area.

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.750
-[IRUMA] Wow!
-[CLARA] Not bad.

00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:49.333
[IRUMA] You drew
all that from memory?

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:50.458
Yes, indeed!

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.167
It was on
the school prospectus,

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:53.583
so I memorized it.

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.167
Though I doubt this one
has even taken

00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:57.583
a brief glance
at our esteemed catalog.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:58.750
Yeah, you know it!

00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:02.167
[ASMODEUS] If we can figure out
where the barriers are

00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:03.792
on this map ahead of time,

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:06.458
you should be able to get
to your goal unfettered.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.000
However...

00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:09.000
What's wrong?

00:17:09.042 --> 00:17:10.750
I sense that our small number

00:17:10.792 --> 00:17:12.833
is going to be a problem
if our aim is to find

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:14.708
all of the barriers
by our lonesome.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.708
[IRUMA]
Hmm.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.167
If only we had the ability

00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:19.833
to control frogs,
like Professor Momonoki does.

00:17:19.875 --> 00:17:21.125
-I've got something.
-[IRUMA/ASMODEUS] Huh?

00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:22.875
My soldiers!

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.333
Wait, what soldiers?

00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:26.333
[CLARA] The ones that were
in the MagiApp room!

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:30.458
You can actually make
those things appear?
