please also be mindful
of your fellow Battlers.

Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.667
One day, he found himself
the grandson

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.167
of a demon named Sullivan.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.417
Sullivan loves
and spoils Iruma

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:27.167
and is even sending him
to the most prestigious school

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:28.458
in the land.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.542
But there's just one problem.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.333
The school Iruma is attending

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:33.875
just so happens to be

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:36.875
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:39.250
[IRUMA] I can't ever let them
find out I'm human,

Really, how dare you?

That was awesome,

to join a Battler...

By the end,
you must join one.

the ranks.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.833

an important decision.

I wonder which Battler
I should join.

Master Iruma, let's go observe
them together after this.

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:00.625
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:03.375
Come join us!
You won't regret it!

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:06.375
Yes, you should be part
of our alliance!

00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:08.875
Moco. Moco moco.

00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:11.708
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:15.625
Hey Asmodeus--

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:20.875
Wow, it's like a festival!
Right, Iruma-kins?

00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:23.750
-[IRUMA] Yeah, totally.
-Iruma-kins?!

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:25.750
Whoa, the flyers talked!

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:27.917
I just keep getting more,

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.250
and I can't say no.

00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:30.875
[NARRATOR]
As we have often mentioned,

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.417
Iruma cannot refuse
any request.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.333
Master, please allow me
to handle those for you.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.042
[flames whooshing]

00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:39.292
Oh, thank you!

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:41.167
You're so silly,
Iruma-kins.

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:42.917
You should only take
the ones you need.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.917
And this, my lovelies, is the
Succubus Seduction Battler.

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.167
Mwah!

00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:50.667
[CLARA]
Hey, Miss Raim!

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:52.208
-Can I?
-Of course!

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.917
Aah! You still haven't given up
on that stuff yet?!

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.125
Hey-hey! It's Iruma, the leader
of the gleesome threesome!

00:09:58.167 --> 00:09:59.875
How's it going?

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:01.917
You guys come
to get flyers, too?

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.917
Yeah, but I already know
which Battler I'm joining.

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.167
Oh? You've already
decided on one?

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.958
-How admirable of you.
-[LEAD/JAZZ] Hmm?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.708
Yeah, the Game Battler!

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.917
It's great for learning
new strategies.

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.042
You just want to play games.

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:17.042
I'm joining
the New Magic Battler.

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.792
I want to learn
some new spells

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.417
and alchemy techniques.

00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:21.958
And you just want money!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.667
I want to join
the Ladies' Studies Battler.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.208
That doesn't even exist!

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.375
You fools need to take this
more seriously!

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.125
Weren't you listening
to Kalego?

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:32.333
This is vital to moving--

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.208
-What about you?
-Eh?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.292
I mean, you already have
tons of magic,

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:37.708
so you could take your pick.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.292
That's true,
since you're always

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:41.458
the center
of attention around here.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.875
Oh, right.
These are Grandpa's powers.

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:48.375
But to everyone else,
they obviously look like mine.

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:52.000
I actually haven't made up
my mind yet.

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:54.750
-Ah!
-[LEAD/JAZZ] Huh?

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:57.083
[screaming]

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.000
Master Iruma!

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.125
[IRUMA]
My ring's moving on its own!

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:03.750
Is it gonna freak out again?!

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:07.958
I don't know which Battler
I should join. Eiko?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.750
I'm gonna pick
the same exact one

00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:11.208
Iruma chooses, of course,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.000
but I wonder
which one it's gonna be?

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:16.250
[screaming]

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:19.250
Sorry, watch out, everybody!
Please move!

00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:21.250
-[clattering]
-[screaming]

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:27.417
[BOTH groaning]

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.083
I...

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:33.958
-I am so sorry!
-I am so sorry!

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:45.000
[groaning]

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.208
Uh, sorry, are you okay?

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:51.208
Is he dead?!

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.375
Oh no,
I've really done it now.

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:57.542
Wow, you gave me quite a scare.
I thought I was a goner.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:58.708
You're alive!

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.000
[IRUMA]
But you were bleeding.

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:03.625
Ah, yeah.
It's this condition I have.

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.083
Not to worry though.
I cough up blood all--

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.458
[coughs]

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.042
[IRUMA]
That actually sounds like

00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:10.750
a perfect reason to worry.

00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:13.375
Hey, you're wearing

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:15.292
the Gluttonous Feeder Ring,
ain't ya?

00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:17.917
That explains it.

00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.417
The ring must have reacted
to my collar.

00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:22.917
This is made of the same metal
the ring is forged from.

00:12:24.042 --> 00:12:25.125
Huh, really?

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.750
What do you mean by...

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.875
[BOY]
Ugh, look at all this crud.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.042
Get this out of here,
like now!

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.875
Wow, we did make a mess.
Sorry about that.

00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:38.208
No, this is all my fault,
really! I'm so sorry!

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:41.500
Wait. Isn't that guy
an upperclassman?

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:43.250
Oh, i-is he really?!

00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:47.708
He's just a lousy Bet!
Don't scare me like that!

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.167
-[grunts]
-Oh!

00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:51.500
Loser.
[laughing]

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:53.625
Those guys didn't hurt you
too bad, did they?

00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:56.292
You're their upperclassman!

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.500
Well, to be fair,
I'm only a Bet.

00:12:58.542 --> 00:13:00.167
I don't have much magic, so...

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:01.542
But...

00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:02.708
[BOY]
I made this so I could

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.250
store up magic inside of it.

00:13:05.292 --> 00:13:07.208
So that maybe one day,

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.625
even demons who don't have
much natural magic

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.000
can still use it.

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:13.167
That's the kind of apparatus
I want to create.

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:20.667
I gotta be
on my way now.

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.542
Ow! What the hell?

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:26.208
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry...

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.333
-[IRUMA] Ohh!
-...sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:30.792
[IRUMA] He seems
awkwardly relatable.

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:35.333
He doesn't have magic,
just like me.

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:37.458
-Iruma, sir!
-Wow, Iruma-kins!

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.333
I can't believe
you flew this far!

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:41.250
You moved at such
incredible speed!

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:42.708
I'm so impressed!

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.333
[nervous chuckle]
Sorry about that.

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.583
[ASMODEUS] Now, let us move on
to the next one.

Yis, Yis. Welcome, welcome!

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:56.583
We of the Diabotany Battler grow
and study various magic plants

00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.583
and their many properties
and uses.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:00.708
We even make medicines
as well.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.792
Aah!
[chuckles]

00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:06.167

-...boo!
-Ugh.

Ah! It's feeding time!

I'd nearly forgotten.

-So high! Like a gondola!

Please stop by and chat with us!

00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:31.167
Our Library Battler has
a huge collection

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:32.583
of netherworld history books

00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:34.500
and some
just-for-fun books, too!

00:14:34.542 --> 00:14:35.792
Ahh!

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.000
Ah!

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.833
Whenever we find out
about any rare books,

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:41.792
we go right out
and snap them up

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:43.458
and sometimes translate 'em!

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.250
We all pursue whatever subject
or field suits our passion, see!

00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:50.250
Wow! This place has such a nice,
calm atmosphe--

-[boom]
-Uhh!

00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:53.542
This guy's been cursed
by one of the books

00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:55.250
and become a complete moron!

00:14:55.292 --> 00:14:57.417
You idiot!
How many times did I tell you

00:14:57.458 --> 00:15:00.292
to stay at least two meters away
when opening new books?

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.375
It's just hopeless now!

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:04.417

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:06.917

-Hmm?

Come by again, okay?

[IRUMA]
Uh... 'kay.

00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.125
So we learned books are yummy.
I had no idea.

00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:16.875
Let us hasten
to the next one.

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.042
[SABNOCK]
I am here!

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:20.500
Demon King Battler!

00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:23.208
What could fit better for me,
the next Demon King?!

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.958
Alright! I now accept
all challengers!

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.792
I shall strike you all down!

00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:31.667
What?!

00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:37.917
You wanna join?

00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.208
Uh, indeed!

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.750
We exhaustively read

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:42.542
all the documents
on the Demon King

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:44.458
and study them
to the fullest extent.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.708
You have documents
on the Demon King?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.625
Let's make
our usual predictions

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:50.208
for the next Demon King.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.000
You never get sick
of that, huh?

00:15:52.042 --> 00:15:53.458
[snorting laughter]

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.125
Uhh...

[SABNOCK]
What a stroke of luck!

00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:03.333
So many books and papers
I've never seen before!

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:04.792
An excellent find!

[IRUMA] Um,

Ohh, I guess
it is due for a tuning.

Mm-hmm.

It's an extra special move

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:21.417
that'll use
most of the magic
