No cuts, no bruises.
No problems.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.458
-Hey.
-[IRUMA chuckling nervously]

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.125
-[gasps] Apologies.
-[IRUMA yells]

00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:14.625
It was a bit ham-handed,

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.125
but I managed
to make contact with him.

00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:18.875
If he shows signs
of needing help,

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:21.250
I need to
take him in immediately.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.167
[IRUMA]
Uh, excuse me?

00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:26.417
This has been
a well-kept secret,

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:28.375
but I've actually encountered
a human being

00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:29.583
in my distant past.

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:33.583
Huh? A-A human, really?
That's amazing.

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.792
What happened,
did you manage to capture it?

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:38.208
Yes, of course I did.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.375
Their torso went to the lab
for experiments.

00:17:40.417 --> 00:17:42.333
The lower half
I enjoyed in a hotpot

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:43.833
with some of my colleagues.

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:45.333
[screams]

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:47.333
You needn't worry,
only joking.

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:48.625
[yelps]

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:51.583
[IRUMA]
How was I supposed to know?!

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:53.042
To be totally honest,

00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:55.250
if a human were to be found
in the netherworld,

00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:56.833
I'm not sure what would happen.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.542
[gasps]

00:17:58.583 --> 00:18:01.167
Some demons
are going back to basics.

00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:04.083
So it'd be quite dangerous
for a human here.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.250
That's why I took that human in

00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:07.625
and made sure they were returned

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:10.458
safe and sound
to their own world.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.792
In addition,
I did the proper paperwork

00:18:12.833 --> 00:18:14.542
so they could
go back immediately.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.917
We did a procedure
that erased all their memories

00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.833
of being in the netherworld
and sent them home.

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.500
You took their memories?

00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:26.125
[HENRI]
Iruma, if you're seeking help,

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:27.125
please don't hesitate to--

00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:28.375
[AMERI]
Hey, Father.

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:30.625
I've been looking
all over for you.

00:18:30.667 --> 00:18:32.042
Oh, Ameri?

00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:35.167
Wait, he's your father?!

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:38.000
Yes, he's my father,

00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:40.625
and he's employed
at the Demon Border Patrol.

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:42.000
[IRUMA]
Ahh.

00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:44.958
So you already know Iruma, then?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.125
Sure, he's very famous
at our school.

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:51.875
He's built an impressive record
since the day he got here.

00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:55.375
At the Battler Party,
he put on a superb show.

00:18:56.292 --> 00:18:57.958
Iruma is...

00:18:59.167 --> 00:19:00.542
[gasps softly]

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.125
Iruma...

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:09.708
is a most
outstanding demon.

00:19:15.208 --> 00:19:18.292
[HENRI] Well, I only came to see
the chair demon today.

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:21.125
I had asked this young man
for directions.

00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:23.792
-Thank you very much.
-[gasps] No problem.

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.750
But it's rather unusual

00:19:25.792 --> 00:19:27.542
for you to praise
anyone this grandly.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.917
[gasps] Oh.

00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.292
it's just that we've had

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:32.417
some rather enlightening chats
alone recently.

00:19:32.458 --> 00:19:33.875
[HENRI]
Hmm?!

00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:36.375
[HENRI]
"Alone," you say?

00:19:36.417 --> 00:19:37.375
Uh-huh.

00:19:37.417 --> 00:19:38.708
Sometimes we have tea

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.625
in the audience room
when school gets out.

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:42.625
-[BOTH] Tea-hee, tea-hee.
-[HENRI] Tea?

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:44.750
[yells]

00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:45.917
[gasping]

00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.042
[AMERI]
And then, we talk.

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.083
Go on.

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:50.375
Just what do you talk about

00:19:50.417 --> 00:19:51.542
when you're alone together?

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:54.458
[gasps] Uh, well, you see...

00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:57.542
Manga are forbidden texts.

00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:00.292
I can't tell him
we're reading those.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:03.042
What are you doing
alone together?

00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:04.833
[gasps]

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:07.417
Actually, we talk all about
love and relationships.

00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:09.458
[gasps]

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.417
L-l-lo... L... Lo...

00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:17.708
Oh, and we also talk about
what our futures hold for us.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.458
[HENRI echoing]
Love. Love.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.000
Future. Future.

00:20:21.042 --> 00:20:22.250
Marriage. Marriage.

00:20:24.083 --> 00:20:25.500
Father.

00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:30.458
Father, no matter how old I get,
I'll always be your little girl.

00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:33.292
[church bells tolling]

00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:38.625
[AMERI]
Father...

00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:41.833
[HENRI]
Not Happening!

00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:43.250
[IRUMA]
How do they keep breaking?

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:44.833
[groans]

00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:46.125
Father, no.

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:48.167
-Are you alright, sir?
-Bite your tongue!

00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:50.333
No one gave you permission
to call me "Father."

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.375
-[gasps] But I didn't.
-You've got some nerve, child.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.833
-Quick, to the infirmary.
-[HENRI] How dare you?

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:56.500
[groans]

00:20:56.542 --> 00:20:58.292
I'll see you later, Iruma.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:00.750
[chuckles nervously]

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.542
That was like
walking through a storm.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.625
[HENRI] That's why
I took that human in,

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.000
and made sure they were returned

00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:10.625
safe and sound
to their own world.

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:12.042
[CLARA]
Hey. Iruma-kins.

00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:14.750
Kaboom! Kaboom! [chuckles]

00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:18.458
Why must you always insist on
acting like a psychotic gremlin?

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.833
[chuckles]

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:21.458
-Master Iruma.
-Huh?

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.333
Regarding the Kiriwo issue,

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:26.417
I realize you're deeply
involved in it,

00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:28.042
so I won't pry for answers.

00:21:28.083 --> 00:21:29.333
Buh-boop. Ugh.

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:31.625
But if there's anything
we can do for you,

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:33.917
please don't hesitate to ask us.

00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:35.792
Wow, you guys.

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:36.958
[chuckles]

00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:39.333
[chuckles softly]

00:21:40.292 --> 00:21:41.250
[IRUMA]
Going back...

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:47.583
It's true, that was what
I wanted at one point, but...

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.750
[BOTH chuckle]

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:55.333

00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:56.833
Thanks, you two.

00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:00.417
Okay, let's get back to class.

00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:02.792
-[ASMODEUS] Let's.
-[CLARA] Yay!

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.458
Iruma.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.333
Yo, Iruma.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:07.583
Hey, Iruma.

00:22:08.542 --> 00:22:12.000
[IRUMA] No matter what happens
from here on out...

00:22:12.042 --> 00:22:16.333
I'm going to make sure
they never find out I'm human.

00:23:49.292 --> 00:23:53.375
And we all are... Su-ki-ma.

00:23:53.417 --> 00:23:55.083
Oh, my devi, Iruma.

00:23:55.125 --> 00:23:56.875
Photo op time. Yay!

00:23:56.917 --> 00:23:58.375
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:01.500
No, you've got it all wrong.
Please.

00:24:01.542 --> 00:24:04.833
I just wanted a photo of Iruma
while he was eating.

00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:06.542
Well, then you've a great eye.

00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:08.750
And you won't find
anyone kinder, really.

00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:10.667
Yeah. Oh, and his
hair tuft is so cute.

00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:13.458
[IRUMA] Weird, I almost never
see Azz talking to girls.

00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:18.292
Congratulations on winning
the Tricky Award,

00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.292
and ranking up
to Gimel, Iruma sir.

00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:22.667
It's a shame we couldn't get
Most Valuable Battler,

00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:25.000
but you're always
the most valuable in my heart.

00:24:25.042 --> 00:24:27.417
You absolutely slay me!

00:24:27.458 --> 00:24:30.292
Next time "Dem-dol Kuromu."

00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:31.875
A dem-dol concert?

00:24:31.917 --> 00:24:33.750
I'm going if you are,
Master Iruma.

00:24:33.792 --> 00:24:36.542
I, Alice Asmodeus,
will follow you anywhere,

00:24:36.583 --> 00:24:38.875
even to the ends
of the netherworld!
