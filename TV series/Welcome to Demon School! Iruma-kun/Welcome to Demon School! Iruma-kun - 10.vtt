00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.000
as he could possibly be.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.875
[OPERA]
Yes.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.083
Quite ready.

[NARRATOR]
Iruma Suzuki, age 14.

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.708
One day, he found himself
the grandson

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.208
of a demon named Sullivan.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.458
Sullivan loves and spoils Iruma,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.667
and is even sending him

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:43.667
to the most
prestigious school in the land.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:45.583
But there is just one problem.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.417
The school Iruma is attending

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:48.917
just so happens to be

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.292
[IRUMA] I can't ever
let them find out I'm human

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.417
or I'm gonna get eaten for sure.

[IRUMA, ASMODEUS, CLARA] "Fierce

of the execution cannonball

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.042
[SULLIVAN]
The day's finally here.

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.583
-[IRUMA] Hmm?
-How are you doing?

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.500
Do you feel pretty good
about your chances?

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:47.083
I do.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.500
Or That's what
I'm telling myself at least.

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.208
Oh, are you still
frightened, then?

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.833
Well, I mean... [laughs]

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.208
If so, here's
one last bit of advice.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.708
Isn't that my tea?

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.458
You can consider it
a life hack for future use.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.708
-[SULLIVAN groans]
-A life hack?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.458
It's an old
netherworld technique

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.917
to get ourselves
through predicaments.

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.875
Fear breeds utter humiliation
for demons.

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:18.292
In regards to survival
in a competitive society

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.958
like the netherworld,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.042
fearing your enemy is basically
tantamount to defeat.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:24.417
[IRUMA gasps]

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:27.000
So this means,
the more scared you are,

00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:28.667
the bolder you must be.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.208
Transform your fear
into excitement.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.458
I said that's my tea.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.667

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.583
[IRUMA] That's it. I just
have to be prepared and step up.

[GIRL 1] Today's promotion
exam day, right?

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.250
Maybe Asmodeus is gonna
raise his rank even higher.

00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:02.083
[GIRL 2]
I mean, how could he not?

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.667
Well, sometimes keeping
a hot guy in their place

00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:05.833
can be a good thing.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:32.500
what all your training's
led up to.

Silence, clowns.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.000
Pay attention
as we go over the rules.

00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:40.917
[grunts in annoyance]

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.125
Execution cannonball,
super easy. Check it.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.417
One: Each team
should have one person

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:47.833
stationed outside the field.

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:50.375
Two: Everyone else
stands within said field.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.750
Three: If the ball hits you,
you're off the field.

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.792
It's okay to attack
from out of bounds.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:56.875
But please note,

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:58.042
even if you hit someone,

00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:00.500
you cannot return to the field.

00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:04.042
Four: You may
only use magic on the ball.

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.000
Direct magic attacks
on your opponent are forbidden.

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:09.125

that cute little explaining
heart thingy.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:19.333
Your promotions
will be determined

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:21.292
by which team triumphs,

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.917
as well as by the rankings
of the opponents you hit.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.917
Here are the arm bands
for Teams A and B.

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.333
Team A is yellow
and Team B is red.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.625
Once you put them on, split up.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.917
[STUDENTS]
Okay.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.083
Yellow! Team A is the best team.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.792
Team A is the victory team.

Why are you
dividing us this way?

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:20.958
Placing my friend Master Iruma
and me on separate teams

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.417
is simply ludicrous!

00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.167
You were split to even out
the power balance.

I'll have to help Master Iruma

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:39.000
from the enemy camp.

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:40.542
Fine, I'll handle it.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:42.125
What do you mean? [laughs]

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.542
Come on. Hurry up, Iruma-kins.

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:47.125

Let's both do our best.

Indeed. You can count on it.

Ah. It's finally time.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:06.458
Just play it safe,
everybody knows that.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.458
So don't throw it at Iruma.

Hmm.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.292
[GOEMON] We've already seen
that he's skilled enough

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.708
to defeat Asmodeus,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.917
and he's also
a master at evasion.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.167
[SCHNEIDER]
A wise man never courts danger.

What's the matter?
Hurry up and throw the ball.

[LEAD] Good idea.
How about right at him?

in class that day.

Great idea.

Seize the day, as they say.

So, who's gonna throw it?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.208
Goodness, there are
balls everywhere.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.708
Crap, which one's the real one?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.750
This is another trial
to become the Demon King!

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:45.292
We should look for it, too.

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:46.875
-[GOEMON] You're right.
-[SCHNEIDER groans]

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.125
[SCHNEIDER]
Ah, my devi bone.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.750
-[SABNOCK] Found it.
-[ALL] Hmm?

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:51.792
My eyes do not deceive me.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:54.250
-[hissing]
-[laughs menacingly]

00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:56.000
What?!

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:58.750
Yeah, that's definitely
not our ball.

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:00.125
[yawns]

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:03.000
You guys are so... loud!

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.167
[ALL scream]

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:08.167
Hey, where's the ball?!

00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:11.167
Right there. Grab it now!

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:13.417
[grunting]

00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:17.917
[IRUMA]
Keep your eyes on the ball...

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.667
and grab it!

00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.458
[grunts]

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.958
[ALL gasp]

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.458
You're amazing,
Iruma-kins. Whoo!

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.833
[snickers] Well done,
my stout-hearted rival.

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.250
You're out, Agares.

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:32.958
You used your magic on
something other than the ball.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.417
Only because
they're all so noisy.

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:36.333
[yawns]

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.542
[IRUMA] I can see
my training paying off.

00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:43.333
Thank you, Opera!

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.750
Now, I'll throw...

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.042
[gasps] Oh...

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.792
They never taught me
how to throw!

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:52.042
[gasps] Wh-what should I do?

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:53.292
[BOYS gasp]

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.083
[GOEMON]
He looks so intense.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.792
Hurry, you guys, spread out.

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:01.542
Help him. But how?

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:05.583
You show 'em the true power
of an honor student, Iruma!

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.958
-[ELIZABETTA chuckles softly]
-[CLARA panting and chuckling]

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.208
[groaning]

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.375
[KALEGO]
Hmph.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:13.792
[gasps in fear]

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:15.458
[IRUMA]
Everyone's staring.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.125
That was an excellent catch,
my rival.

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:19.333
[IRUMA]
Oh, Sabnock.

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:22.000
Let me handle the attack.

00:10:22.042 --> 00:10:23.083
-[chuckles]
-[IRUMA] Huh.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.000
[SABNOCK]
I don't like it.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.583
We're in the heat of battle,
and he's daydreaming.

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:30.958
Since becoming my rival's
willing underling,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.333
he's gone completely soft
as a demon.

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:35.583
Then I shall whip you
back into shape.

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:37.625
Look out!

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.917
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.458
[ASMODEUS] How dare you
disrupt my focus?!

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.083
-[SABNOCK screams]
-Off the field, Sabnock.

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.000
You're out.

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:49.917
[SABNOCK gasps, grunts angrily]

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.500
[whimpers]

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:53.750
[SABNOCK]
Pass the ball to me outside!

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:56.000
-Fare thee well, O Gigantic One.
-[chuckles] 'Kay.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:58.250
Honestly...

00:10:58.292 --> 00:10:59.208
Oh, wow.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.250
That Asmodeus sure is bad news.

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.167
Lesson learned,
don't throw to that one.

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.083
Okay, Sabro,
I will avenge you.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.750
Yay! [groans]

00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:11.125
Valac, you twit.

00:11:11.167 --> 00:11:13.375
-Come on.
-[IRUMA chuckles nervously]

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:15.500
[NARRATOR] The match
continued in this manner

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:16.750
at a steady pace.

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:18.083
-[ELIZABETTA] Oh, my!
-[KALEGO] Out.

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.250
[SCHNEIDER]
There's no excuse for failure.

00:11:20.292 --> 00:11:21.292
[KALEGO]
Then what's yours?

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:23.417
Off the field, now.

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:24.375
[JAZZ screams]

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.792
[NARRATOR]
One after another,

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:28.333
the demons were quickly
eliminated from the court.

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.542
[screams]

00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.750
Then, finally...

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:33.667
[ASMODEUS]
Hmm?

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:36.000
This is... Hmm.

00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:39.375
[JAZZ] The only ones left
are Asmodeus and Iruma!

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:43.375
[ASMODEUS] No Master Iruma and I
are the last ones standing!

00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:45.375
[groans uncomfortably]

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:48.125
This should be good
since Iruma's so hard to hit.

00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.042
Job well done, my rival.

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:51.167
Get him, yeah!

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:52.875
Yay, Iruma-kins!

00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:54.625
[snoring]

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:56.125
Come on, kick his butt.

00:11:56.167 --> 00:11:59.083
The victors are the true
authors of history.

00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:02.250
Now, let us cheer together,
what do you say?

00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:05.500
[KALEGO]
Hmph.

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:08.208
[ASMODEUS gasps]
When did this happen?

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.000
I was so deep in thought
I hadn't noticed at all.

00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:13.542
There's no way I can attack
Master Iruma.

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:16.458
Wait. If we're the last
two players remaining,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.708
the only possible thing to do
is to just give him the ball,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.458
and let him hit me.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.250
-Iruma...
-[exhales sharply]

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:27.417
[gasps deeply]

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:29.917
â™ª

00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.792
Shame on me.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:36.292
Have I bothered to look
at his face even once

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:39.042
since this
wretched match started?

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:41.292
Let him hit me?

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:43.250
Lose deliberately?

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.083
And have him gain
a rank that way?

00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:51.583
How foolish can I be?!

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.625
I've been by his side
watching how hard he's worked,

00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:58.708
and yet,
I've thought only of myself.

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:02.708
I never even considered
what Master Iruma is thinking,

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.250
standing there alone.

00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:05.542
It must be torture.

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:09.292
You have
humiliated yourself, Asmodeus!

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:10.292
[groans]

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.292
[grunts softly]

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.292
[gasps]

00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:18.000
Full strength
deserves reciprocation.

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:22.500
I am a demon who values
and respects etiquette.

00:13:22.542 --> 00:13:25.167
I am Asmodeus Alice.

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:27.667
And I will give this
everything I have!

00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.458
[IRUMA gasps]
I'll catch it.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:34.750
â™ª

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:41.917
[footsteps]

00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958
It's pretty rare
for you to come watch

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.833
the first-years'
promotion exams.

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:49.208
Oh, you must be interested
in the top student, Asmodeus.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.833
[BOY] He would be quite
an excellent candidate

00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:53.333
to welcome into
the student council, agreed?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.583
Actually...

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:59.542
it's possible we might see
something even more interesting.

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:02.833
â™ª

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.917
[GOEMON] Oh, my devi,
it's down to a one-on-one.

00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.708
Yeah, who cares if we're out?
Asmodeus, get him!

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.250
-Go, Iruma. You can do it!
-Whoo! Best seat in the house!

00:14:13.292 --> 00:14:15.750
Go, go, Iruma-kins. Fight on.

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:17.083
-Fight on. Fight on.
-[SABNOCK] Hmm.

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:19.833
If only I could
return to the court.

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:22.125
Hey, know what I just realized?

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:24.875
This is their first battle
since the entrance ceremony.

00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:26.958
â™ª

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.917
[IRUMA] Azz seems
completely different than usual.

00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.333
He's so serious.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.875
No, that's actual
malice in his eyes.

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:40.167
â™ª

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:42.458
[grunts, yells]

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.458
[JAZZ]
There it is.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.458
Get back!

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.583
[IRUMA gulps]
I'm scared.

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:48.000
[breathing shakily]

00:14:48.042 --> 00:14:51.375
I've gotten through
some sticky situations before,

00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:53.125
and every instinct
I've developed

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:55.250
is telling me to run.

00:14:55.292 --> 00:14:56.208
But...

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:58.917
[grunts]

00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.458
This means
the more scared you are,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.958
the bolder you must be.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.208
[IRUMA]
Be bolder.

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.625
[OPERA]
Transform your fear...

00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:07.958
into excitement.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.458
-[GOEMON] What?!
-You have a death wish?!

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.458

[grunting in effort]

00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:27.625
[IRUMA]
This is Azz's true strength?

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.083
I can't. It's too powerful!

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:34.667
In that case...

00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:38.333
I'll just have to...

00:15:41.917 --> 00:15:42.875
[groans]

00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:45.125

[whistle blows]

00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:21.417
The winners of the match
are Team A.

-[TEAM A MEMBERS cheering]
-We... We we won?

I won?!

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:28.417
[ALL cheering]

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:29.917
[CLARA]
That was the coolest!

00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.000
It was like, whoosh, whoosh,
twirly, twirly, kablooey.

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:35.250
Well done, my brave rival.

00:16:35.292 --> 00:16:36.750
Yeah, like a boss.

00:16:36.792 --> 00:16:38.292
Let's give him a lift. Come on.

00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:39.625
Ready, and...

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:43.167
[ALL]
Heave-ho. Heave-ho.

00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:45.083
-Heave-ho.
-Whee.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.333
-Heave-ho.
-So high.

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:47.750
[JAZZ]
Wait, did they switch places?

00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:49.125
[SABNOCK]
When didst thou...

00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:50.750
[CLARA]
You should try, too, Sabro.

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:53.792
-[ALL groan]
-[overlapping chatter]

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:57.333
I gave everything. All I had.

00:16:58.375 --> 00:17:00.958
[chuckles softly]
I'm soundly beaten.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.333
I'm truly no match for you,
Iruma sir.

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:05.333
[chuckles]

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.833
Nice, Azz-Azz!

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:08.833
[CAMUI]
That fireball was unbelievable!

00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.625
-[GOEMON] You were so cool!
-[CAMUI] Hoot. Hoot. Hoot.

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:12.000
Can I call you Azz-Azz?

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:12.958
Get off me.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.458
[indistinct chatter]

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.458
Asmodeus has remarkable skill.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.583
Not many upperclassmen
could catch that.

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:24.458
Yet instead of fleeing in fear,
he pressed ever forward.

00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:27.375
He reflexively thrust
the incredible strength

00:17:27.417 --> 00:17:28.875
of the throw aside,

00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:32.000
put his own powerful spin
on it to sustain its momentum,

00:17:32.042 --> 00:17:34.500
and threw it back
even harder at Asmodeus.

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:39.500
Iruma managed to use that
bizarre evasion skill of his

00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:41.417
as an effective attack.

00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:42.417
Ugh.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.917
Iruma.

00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.625
[IRUMA gasps]
Hmm?

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:52.125
If it was obvious
that Asmodeus had let you win,

00:17:52.167 --> 00:17:56.000
I was never going to allow you
to raise your rank ever.

00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:56.958
[gasps]

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.875
But both of you

00:17:57.917 --> 00:17:59.583
truly gave it your all.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.167
Therefore...

00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:04.500
Iruma, I hereby approve
your promotion to Bet.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:05.708
Whoa!

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.000
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:09.208
Yay! You did it!

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.792
I am so proud of you.

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:12.000
Oh, boo.

00:18:12.042 --> 00:18:14.000
You could at least
give him a Gimel rank.

00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:17.333
Indeed. Bet for that performance
is just insulting.

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.833
Cheapo. Boo-boo.

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:20.333
-[KALEGO] Get over it.
-[STUDENTS] Huh?

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:22.167
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:25.125
There will be more exams.

00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:27.083
If you lot want to be
promoted as well,

00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:28.458
then you must work harder.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.333
That is all.

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:31.708
-[ALL gasp]
-[LEAD] Okay.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.125
Hold on. Isn't my rank
going up, too?

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:36.833
[KALEGO]
Negative.

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.208
[shudders]

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.125
Alright, let's head home.

00:18:40.167 --> 00:18:42.292
[CAMUI] You must be tired
after all that, Elizabetta.

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:44.250
Shall I massage your shoulders?

00:18:44.292 --> 00:18:46.083
[ELIZABETTA]
That's okay.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.208
-[ASMODEUS] Huh?
-[CAMUI] Does that mean yes?

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.583
Master Iruma?

00:18:48.625 --> 00:18:49.542
[CLARA gasps]

00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:55.167
[IRUMA]
I... I think I'm still in shock.

00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:58.167
My heart feels so full.

00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.750
I've never felt this way.

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:01.458
[AMERI]
Congratulations, Iruma.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.208
[IRUMA gasps]
Ameri.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.667
I was watching your performance.

00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:07.750
Markedly different
from yesterday.

00:19:07.792 --> 00:19:08.625
But that's--

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:09.958
Why do you keep popping up,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.250
Lady Redhair?!

00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:13.750
[grunting]

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:15.417
[ASMODEUS]
I don't follow.

00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:17.625
What exactly
are they talking about?

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:22.750
It's just I've... never worked
that hard for just my own sake.

00:19:23.917 --> 00:19:26.458
But now I finally know

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.708
how it feels to accomplish
something just for myself.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.250
What an amazing feeling.

00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:34.000
Huh. Yes, indeed.

00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:38.000
That warm, happy feeling you get
after overcoming your obstacles,

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:41.250
using your strong will,
both physical and mental,

00:19:41.292 --> 00:19:42.625
that is truly...

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:44.208
ambition!

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.792
Say what?

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.417
It is?!

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:49.750
Mm-hmm.

00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:51.625
Your passion towards it.

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:53.958
Your fighting spirit
to see it all through.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.792
[IRUMA] So ambition
feels kinda warm and fuzzy?

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:02.667
Regardless, you stepped up.
So, well done, Iruma.

00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:03.542

Yo, Iruma.

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:14.292
Professor Kalego just said
he would buy us all some drinks.

Welcome home.

00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.125
So, so, how did
your promotion exam go?

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:27.000
Tell me, tell me!

00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:31.542
Well, I... I ended up one-on-one
with Azz in the last round,

00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:34.208
but I safely raised
my rank one level.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.292
[SULLIVAN] Ho-ho-ho. I knew
you could do it, grandson.

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:38.458
Safely?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.667
With all those wounds
on your hands?

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.458
Azz did some damage.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.542
But he started
apologizing profusely

00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:48.125
and I couldn't get him to stop.

00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:49.583
Please forgive me!

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:50.958
[crying]

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.292
I was able to give
my full concentration

00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.625
to this match.

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:55.708
Because of your help.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.250
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:00.417
[IRUMA]
So...

00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:01.750
thanks, Opera.

00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:02.833
I owe ya.

00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:04.333
[OPERA]
Hmm?

00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:05.708
[SULLIVAN grunts in annoyance]

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.292
You helped me so much.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.167
-[SULLIVAN] But why?
-No, no, really. I mean it.

00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.375
[SULLIVAN] I helped with
your training, too, you know.

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:12.375
-[IRUMA chuckles]
-[OPERA] It was nothing.

Wait. No, I didn't.

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:16.708
No fair! No fair!

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.042
But you gave me
that responsibility.

00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:20.958
Hey. What's with the attitude?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.500
You know very well
I can't help it,

00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:24.125
I would have just
ended up spoiling him.

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:29.000
Uh, hey, I'm grateful to you,
too, Grandpa, honest.

00:21:29.042 --> 00:21:30.958
[NARRATOR] Thus the
execution cannonball match,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.250

came to an end.

I've never felt
like this before.

Everyone was so happy,

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:48.542
and honestly, so was I.

00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.417
If I may ask you,

00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:53.167
do you desire to return
to the human world?

Oh, sure.

I'm not doing that.

Not buying a thing.

I don't outshine the star.

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:02.333

they are rendered
absolutely useless.

are her personal sunglasses.

if he gets a big head
after rising a rank.

00:24:25.792 --> 00:24:27.083
Calm down, Kalego.

00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:29.917
I should soothe my soul
by pruning this cactus.
