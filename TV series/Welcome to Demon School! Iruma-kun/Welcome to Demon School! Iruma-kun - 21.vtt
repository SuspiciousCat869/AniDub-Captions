[KUROMU]
Hey, guys. How you doing?

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:45.958
I'm so psyched to be here.
Now let's have a blast.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.417

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.417
Take a look.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.708
It's a special issue

Oh, someone did take my picture.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.292
[CLARA] Here. One for you,
and one for you.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.292
Oh, we have enough extras,

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.417
why not take one home
as a gift to the chair demon?

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.708
[gasps]
That's alright, really.

-[LEAD] Wow.
-Huh?

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.333
You're legit famous, Iruma.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.417
They gave you better coverage
than Kuromu.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:07.167
Kuro who?

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.958
What?! Are you freakin'
kidding me right now?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.083
The article below yours.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:15.500
"The Dem-dol Kuromu Holds
Her Day-to-Night Concert.

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:18.333
This is the First Concert
at Makubari Dome."

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:20.333
Dem-dol, yeah.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.583
What? You don't know
that either?

-It cannot be helped!
-[gasps]

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.458
Master Iruma has led
a very sheltered life

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.208
with the chair demon
ever since he was young,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.375
so he couldn't possibly know
all the ways of the world.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:31.875
Use your head.

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:34.875
[IRUMA] Ah, he thinks
that's reason I'm clueless.

00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:37.208
[ASMODEUS]
So, the origin of "dem-dol"

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.458
is "take evil."

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.500
It is a very important role
in demon society.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.708
-[ALL] Hmm.
-[IRUMA] Oh.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.875
All demons have
a period of stress

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:52.625
in which they desire to commit
violent or sadistic actions.

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.750
We call this the "evil cycle."

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:58.667
[DEMON]
I wanna be bad. Let me be bad.

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:00.625
[ASMODEUS] In order to keep
that evil cycle in check,

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.250
there are many
healthy alternative forms

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:04.167
of entertainment
in the netherworld.

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.875
Basically, the best way
to instantly relieve our stress

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:08.833
is to play sports
or video games.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:09.917
[growls, snickers]

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.167
[DEMON]
So much better.

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.417
Dem-dols are one of those
forms of entertainment, also.

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:17.958
By gathering many demons
into one venue

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.333
and holding a performance,

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.333
those evil thoughts
turn into excitement

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:22.917
and generates positive energy.

00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.292

[moaning in relief]

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:35.125
And because of this,
popular dem-dols

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:37.875
are received warmly
here in the netherworld.

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:38.833
[IRUMA]
Oh.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:40.208
Among them all,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.917
Kuromu's our greatest hope.

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.000

to be streamed live as well.

[GOEMON]
Super devi cute.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.333
[CAMUI] I try to get into
her concerts all the time!

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.875
The 666-Magnification power
is too much to handle.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.292
Man. I devi wanna go.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:19.625
Whenever she goes on tour,

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:21.750
tickets tend to sell out
almost immediately.

00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:24.042
They're sold via lottery,
and if you're really lucky,

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:25.958
you might even get
to meet her in person.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.083
[IRUMA]
Whoa.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:28.542
Yeah, he's right.

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.208
Sometimes there's
a meet-and-grate with Kuromu

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
after the concert.

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.583
A meet-and-greet?

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:35.458
No! Look, it's
written like this.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.458
Meet-and-grate, see?

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:42.708
It's a dreamy event where we can
grate away our stress

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.333
just by holding Kuromu's hand,
if fortune should smile upon us.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:47.292

nice to meet you, too.

for her cuticle exchanges, too.

Oh. That's really
thoughtful of you.

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:17.417
I've gotta say,
you have guts, Kuromu.

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:19.000
This is huge.

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:20.708
Makubari Dome
is one of the biggest,

most top-shelf venues
in the netherworld.

00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:24.917
The concerts that have been
in this holy land

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.708
are basically legendary.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.583

I'm totally fine.

during the morning show.

I'm definitely most comfortable

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:19.500
when I look like this.

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:22.000
I mean, it's the same at school.

if I'll ever get used to this.

I'll be waiting.

That finger pose,
it's so contrived.

I've never been so embarrassed.

00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:43.708
Maybe I should spend more time
looking into better poses.

I do still have the noon
and night shows coming up.

might be just what I need.
