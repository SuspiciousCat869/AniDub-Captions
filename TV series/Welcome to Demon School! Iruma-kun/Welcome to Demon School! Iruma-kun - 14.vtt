Whose side
are you on, anyway?!

They're just questioning me!

-[OPERA] Is it a false charge?
-Of course it is!

find out.

something's definitely off here.

I'm sure Iruma's so worried
about me that he can't even eat.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.833
Oh, I hate to think
of him starving!

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.917
Actually, he's...

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.667
...engrossed in his
after-dinner games.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:52.833

He's gaming?!

to the Battler Party!

Make sure Iruma
doesn't stay up too late

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.292
and keeps himself warm!

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.417
Oh, and make sure
to read him

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:03.750
a bedtime story!

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.417
Also, be sure to tell him

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:06.833

but he says
there's nothing to worry about.

[NARRATOR]
Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:30.667
One day, he found himself
the grandson

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.167
of a demon named Sullivan.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.375
Sullivan loves
and spoils Iruma

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:38.167
and is even sending him
to the most prestigious school

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:39.417
in the land.

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:41.542
But there is just one problem.

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.375
The school Iruma is attending

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:44.875
just so happens to be

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.958
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.292
[IRUMA] I can't ever let them
find out I'm human,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.333

the Battler Party, was only
a few short days away...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.125
...and all first-years
at the demon school Babyls

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:41.875
were, understandably,
nervous.

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:44.625
That's enough, numbskulls.
You all need to calm down.

I've got major anxiety.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.917
In fact,
both of my parents will!

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.417
My big bro's coming.

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.042
So what about you?

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:57.167
Well, actually, my parents
will be busy that day,

00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:59.042

she'd love to come!

All those families...

back in the human world.

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:10.917
And my parents never bothered
to come on parents' day.

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.375
I wonder what having
your family at school is like.

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.667

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:20.417

a little nervous, too.

but I'm not sure
she's gonna make it.

You clowns.

All of you should be preparing
for this day,

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:51.667
lest you bring shame
upon yourselves.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.583
Also, those staying overnight

[KALEGO] He was taken in
by Demon Border Control?

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:08.917
[MOMONOKI]
Yes. The chair-demon himself

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.708
reported to us from there.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.792
[KALEGO]
What did he say?

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:14.125

Well, uh...

He knows we're all busy
with the Battler Party!

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.125
Wow, that's great, Kalego!

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:30.458
You're the natural choice,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.917
but what horrible things

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.667
are they even accusing
the chair-demon of doing?

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:37.875
Yis, yis. This must be
some kind of horrible mistake.

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:40.042
That's what I'm saying!
They've got it wrong!

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:42.375
The DBC did some
half-assed investigation

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:44.417
and took him
on false charges, right?!

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.542
-I highly doubt that.
-Hmm?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.000
If they're holding one
of the Three Greats,

00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:52.208
Chair-Demon Sullivan,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.000
then I'm certain
they must have a valid reason.

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:58.000
They have a valid reason

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.167
but not enough proof
to arrest him.

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:01.417
Is that what you mean?

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.292
[KALEGO] But if there's
no real evidence,

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:06.542
why'd they make a point
of detaining him right now?

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:07.958
Oh, Kalego!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.708

quite ashamed of that.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.833
Everybody's getting ready now!

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:36.375
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:39.375
Our presentation'll be great,
come on by!

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:42.667
-We have to make 666 of those.
-Right!

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:45.625
Wow!
Everyone is so excited!

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:47.083
I know, right?

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:49.458
And the Battler that gives
the bestest presentation

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.667
gets a prize.

00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:52.750
The members might even
go up a rank.

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.667
-[PEOPLE cheering]
-[ALL] Huh?

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:56.500
[roars]

00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:57.625
Behold, folks!

00:08:57.667 --> 00:08:59.333
Whee!

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:01.667
[ASMODEUS] That's the
Magic Beast Battler's circus.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.958
Looks like they're puttin' on
a fun show again!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.833
Ahh! So cool!

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.417
Ah! Look, there's
the New Magic Battler!

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:14.625
[IRUMA] They seem a little
shady, but I'm curious.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:17.125
-Ladies, ladies, ladies!
-Uh?

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:19.125
[CLARA] Ooh!
The Succubus Battler!

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:21.417
[CAMUI] The sexiness
they exude is so strong,

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:22.958
it's almost suffocating!

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:25.708
[BOTH]
Noice.

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:29.542
Wow, all these Battlers
are so flashy.

00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:32.708
Right. So we can't let them
get ahead of us!

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.167
We're gonna have
to stand out!

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:35.250
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.583
-[coughs]
-[IRUMA] Kiriwo!

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:41.708
-So tiny!
-We only have

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.125
a small fraction
of the space

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:44.375
all the other groups have.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.458
It's smaller than
last year's even.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.125
Hey, look,
the Storage Battler!

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.208
You're storage space
again this year?

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.958
Keep up the good work!

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.375
Thanks, you guys!

00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:56.833
-Don't thank them.
-Huh?

00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:58.875
They're clearly
making fun of you.

00:09:58.917 --> 00:10:00.083
You should be mad.

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:02.250
Ah, I'm pretty used
to it by now.

00:10:02.292 --> 00:10:03.208
[chuckles]

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.750
[KIRIWO]
I'm a third-year,

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:06.417
but I'm still Bet-ranked,

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:09.250
so they don't feel the need
to give me much budget or space.

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:12.292
-I'm real sorry about this.
-It's fine.

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:15.542
Yeah, we can do this!
What do you say? Come on!

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:17.125
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.708
Yes, right you are!

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.750
Show us what you presented
last year!

00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:23.750
[KIRIWO] I, uh, lined up
some new magical apparati.

00:10:23.792 --> 00:10:25.417
Like this, see?

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.500
[IRUMA]
Yup! That's storage space!

00:10:27.542 --> 00:10:30.708
[KIRIWO] But now I've got you
guys as new members this year,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.875
so I'd love to hear
all of your ideas.

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.417
Well, I think...

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:39.708
I was really moved
by the light you created

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.125
with that magical apparatus,

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.042
so I'd love for others
to see it, too.

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:47.750
How about we use my flame magic
that symbolizes my family?

00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:49.083
That might help
in some way.

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.208
I want something
that goes boom, then kaboom,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.208
and then kablooey!

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.625
Something flashy like that!

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:55.042
You guys are
all over the place.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.000
-[CLARA] B-b-b-boom!
-[IRUMA] Okay, then.

00:10:57.042 --> 00:11:01.292
So thus far, we want light
and fire and also kablooeys.

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.500
Oh!

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:04.750
It's fireworks!

00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:06.083
W-what about fireworks?

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.000
-Fire...
-Works?

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.625
They're, uh...

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:13.042
We fire shells filled
with gunpowder at the sky,

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.167
and then they explode.

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.625
Gunpowder exploding
in the sky?

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:19.167
And they'll shoot down demons
in flight?

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:21.625
-So it'll kill things?
-[IRUMA] That's not it!

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.375
They're just
for entertainment!

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:26.083
When they go off, they look
like flowers made of light!

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:28.292
Ah, for entertainment.

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:29.708
Flowers made of light.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.708
Kablooming noses
in the night?!

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.750
[IRUMA]
I hope this works.

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:38.708
Hey, so, doesn't the
Battler Party go till night?

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.042
-Yup.
-[IRUMA] That's ideal, then!

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:43.250
They'll be at their prettiest,
and we'll stand out!

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:46.167
The Magical Apparatus Battler
will start with a bang!

00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:47.458
-And besides...
-[ASMODEUS/KIRIWO/CLARA] Huh?

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.958
[IRUMA] ...who cares
about a small space,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.333
we have the whole sky!

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.958
[BOTH]
Ahh!

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.792
[KIRIWO] Flowers in
the night sky sound lovely!

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.208
[CLARA]
Noses going kablooey!

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.708
Well done, Master Iruma!

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.458
Truly, you have a wonderful,
creative imagination!

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.167
But even so,

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:05.958
using gunpowder may prove
to be a little bit difficult.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.292
Lots of mixing
and experimenting.

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.375
That's a good point.
We may not have enough time.

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:12.875
Well, on that note,
maybe it'd be easier

00:12:12.917 --> 00:12:14.292
to experiment at night?

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:15.417
[KIRIWO]
In that case...

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.625
...let's go do the paperwork
to stay overnight.

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:21.333
[ALL]
We're gonna stay overnight?!

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:33.875
[CLARA] Pajamas!
Nightmare pillow!

00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:35.875
Et cetera, et cetera!

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:37.667
Now, let's spend the night!

00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:38.708
Knock it off!

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.833
You even laid out
the beds.

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:43.125
Now, nightmare pillow fight!

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:44.958
-Then horror stories!
-None of that!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.333
Before all that,
we still have to experiment--

00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:48.583
-[explosion booms]
-[IRUMA] Whoa!

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.792
[IRUMA/ASMODEUS/CLARA]
Are you alright?!

00:12:51.833 --> 00:12:54.458
For starters, I tried mixing up
some gunpowder,

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.583
but I think I messed up.

00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:58.750
I believe I've almost
got it, though.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.500
We need fix you up first!

00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:02.792
Don't worry none.
I ain't even hurt.

00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:05.042
[ASMODEUS]
With an explosion that big?

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.792
[KIRIWO]
Well, let me explain.

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:09.875
Uh, you should just see
for yourself.

00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:11.958
Iruma, let me see your hand,
would ya?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.042
Uh, okay.

00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:17.000
Wait, is this... a wall?

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:18.000
Hiyah!

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.542
Hey, there's something
right there!

00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:23.458
My stars,
it's an invisible wall.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.458
Oh, yay! Knock, knock.
Anybody home?

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.792
Isn't it great?

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:30.792
It's my bloodline ability,
Barrier.

00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:34.708
And it's because of this power
that I've made it through,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.875
despite my clear lack
of magic.

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.333
[IRUMA]
Oh, I see.

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:40.542
Though, I'll still cough up
blood due to shock

00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:42.042
and the fireworks' kickback.

00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:43.375
-[coughs]
-[IRUMA/CLARA gasp]

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:44.583
Is that so?

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:46.042
[KIRIWO]
I guess I didn't consider

00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:47.417
that it's pretty difficult

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:49.333
to make something
you've never seen before.

00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.750
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, you're right.

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:54.042
I'm still the only one
who's ever seen them.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.333
If I could find an example.

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.583
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-[IRUMA] Let me think.

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.125
Oh!

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.583
I'm surprised to see you.

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.708
Usually, I'm doing
the summoning.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.875
Sorry, I know
this is last minute.

00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:09.625
[AMERI]
Don't worry about it.

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:11.083
So...

00:14:11.125 --> 00:14:13.000
...was this all
you needed me to bring?

00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:14.917
[IRUMA] Yes!
I can't thank you enough!

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.125
[RIN]
Badump, badump, badump.

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:19.917
-Uh, hey.
-[KAKERU] Hmm?

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.000
[RIN]
Um...

00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:23.000
Badump, badump, badump.

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:25.583
So, hey... Kakeru, I...

00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:28.000
-...like--
-[KAKERU] Kaboom!

00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:29.875
[RIN/KAKERU]
Boom, boom, kaboom!

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:33.792
[KAKERU] Sorry, I couldn't
quite catch that.

00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:36.000
[IRUMA] Here! Fireworks
at the summer festival!

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.625
Yeah! The fireworks!
That was excellent!

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:41.875
Flowers blooming
in the night sky!

00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:44.958
Oh, the real ones
must be beautiful, right?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.375
The part where
he can't hear her

00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:48.958
over how loud they are
is outstanding, too.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.875
I know!
I love that scene so much!

00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:53.167
[AMERI]
Agreed.

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:54.375
-I'll take that.
-Huh?

00:14:54.417 --> 00:14:56.333
Now, let's read.

00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:57.958
Where'd all that come from?

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.125
You're going to read me
this volume again, eh?

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.417
You are such a charmer.

00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:05.042
-[IRUMA] Actually...
-Huh?

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:07.417
...I was hoping I could borrow
that book from you today.

00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:08.917
Heeehhh!

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.667
H-huh?! Say what?!

00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.500
No way, of course you can't!

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:16.667
-Could you consider it, please?
-No! Absolutely not!

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.750
These are vital,
forbidden texts

00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:20.542
I received from my father.

00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:22.708
I can't go lending them out
to just anyone!

00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.792
Right, I understand.

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:27.458
I shouldn't have
asked you, sorry.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:31.042
Come on, don't let him
get to you!

00:15:31.083 --> 00:15:34.125
Alright, then.
I'll figure it out.

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.792
We'll try to make fireworks
with no example.

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:40.042
Wait. Make what, now?
Fireworks?

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:41.750
The night-blooming sky flowers?

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:43.292
Yeah. That's right.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:45.500
I want to set some off
at the Battler Party.

00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:49.542
[AMERI] I'll see
actual fireworks, for real!

00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:53.167
Ameri?

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:56.417
Goodness, look how late
it's getting.

00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:58.083
I am exhausted.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.667
I'm so tired I might just
forget I left this book

00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:02.833
right here
on the table accidentally,

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:04.250
-Oops.
-Huh?

00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:05.917
But if I did,

00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.792
I guess I could come
get it tomorrow evening.

00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:11.417
Ah! Thank you
so much, Ameri!

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:14.583
No, I told you I'm just going
to accidentally forget it!

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:16.875
But still,
thanks for doing this!

00:16:20.417 --> 00:16:23.417
Yeah. I am so gonna
make this work!

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:28.000
[KIRIWO/ASMODEUS/CLARA oohing]

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:29.667
[KIRIWO]
So that's what they look like!

00:16:29.708 --> 00:16:31.125
[CLARA]
They're super pretty!

00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:34.208
And nothing like
what I was picturing!

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.750
I've never seen
a book like this.

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:37.167
How curious.

00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:38.708
So where did you find it?

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.625
Um, that's a secret.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.292
Well, then,
let's reference this

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:45.083
as we do our experiments.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.167
[IRUMA/ASMODEUS/CLARA]
Right!

00:16:53.167 --> 00:16:55.500
-[explosion booms]
-You okay?!

00:16:55.542 --> 00:16:58.167
I-I think I've almost got it.
[chuckles]

00:16:59.167 --> 00:17:01.208
Now, twisty-twist
that screw!

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.583
Twisting!

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:05.667
I shall now fill this ball
with flame magic.

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.958
-[KIRIWO/IRUMA/CLARA] Whoa!
-[ASMODEUS chuckles]

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.417
Alright, here we go.

00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:18.208
-[snaps fingers]
-[flame whooshing]

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.458
Let's light it up!

[fireworks whistling]

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:27.167
[fireworks explode]

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:31.250
[ALL]
Ahh!

00:17:31.292 --> 00:17:32.750
[BOTH laugh]

00:17:32.792 --> 00:17:34.750
[BOTH]
Ahh!

00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:36.250
[IRUMA/CLARA]
We did it!

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:37.833
Absolutely stunning.

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:40.042
It's a little small,
don't ya think?

00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:42.833
But it's really close
to actual fireworks, now!

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.125
All we gotta do
is make 'em bigger!

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:46.083
-[ASMODEUS/KIRIWO] Hmm.
-[CLARA] Mm-hmm.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.792
What a cute bowtie!

00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:52.417
It was all I had.

00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:55.250
Azz, your pajamas are
so sophisticated!

00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:56.625
The next time I order mine,

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.583
I'm going to get
a bowtie as well.

00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:01.958
Right, then. Sleep time.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.750
-[IRUMA] There he goes.
-[ASMODEUS] Ephemeral.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.875
[CLARA]
He's see-through!

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.125
Come on, I'm not see-through.

00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:09.375
I'm gonna go
turn out the lights.

00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:11.583
-This is so exciting!
-Right?

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:14.208
Indeed. Tomorrow is our day!

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.333
Goodnight, you guys.

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.042
[IRUMA/ASMODEUS/CLARA]
Goodnight!

00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:17.958
[switch clicks]

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:20.917
Horror story time!

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.042
-[IRUMA yelps]
-[giggles]

00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:25.208
-Did I sca--
-Huh?

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.708
[screams]

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.625
[screams]

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:31.375
What? Are you still not
tired enough to sleep?

00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:34.458
Wh-what's the matter,
you guys?!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.167
-It's Kiriwo's fault!
-It's Kiriwo's fault!

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:38.625
Well, Clara, I started
coughin' up blood

00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:40.958
because your face
was so terrifying!

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.375
Yeah, Kiriyan was
a scarier horror story.

00:18:43.417 --> 00:18:44.667
Hey, now!

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:45.917
[KIRIWO]
I always got yelled at

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.792
during demon horror stories.

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:50.000
And of course,
I'd start coughin' up blood,

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:53.042
so everyone would be more scared
of me than the story.

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:56.958
[IRUMA] What even are these
demon horror stories?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Let's have a nightmare
pillow fight!

00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:01.417
-Uh, wait, but Kiriwo's not--
-[KIRIWO] Iruma.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.000
Have you forgotten
my bloodline ability?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.917
[CLARA]
Nightmare Pillow Fight, start!

00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.208
The teams will be Kiriyan
and Iruma-kins

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.042
versus me and Azz-Azz!

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:14.792
[grunting]

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.417
Ooh! Whoa! Aah!

00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:19.417
There! There! There!

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.417
We won't lose this.

00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:24.917
You may be in charge,
but I'm not holding back!

00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.500
Get down!

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:29.917
We're battling, Iruma, sir!
Let no punches be pulled!

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.333
Oh no-no-no-no-no!

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.417
Uh! Ooh! Uh! Ooh!

00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:36.417
Ah! As expected,
I haven't hit you once.

00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:37.542
In that case...

00:19:37.583 --> 00:19:38.833
[IRUMA] I thought
we were sticking

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:40.083
to pillows?!

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.500
Huh? Kiriwo!

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:45.917
Go, Iruma,
before I reach my limit.

00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.958
Oh right, gotcha!
Hey, Clara!

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.792
-[ASMODEUS] Wha... Wait!
-That pillow's mine!

Great, now's our--

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:52.500
Oh no.

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:54.875
I'm okay.

00:19:54.917 --> 00:19:56.333
Do it, Iruma.
Get 'em.

00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:00.958

Attack!

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.083

Amazing as usual, master!

-[CLARA] Give me it!
-[ASMODEUS] Valac, stop!

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:08.542
-[CLARA] Come on, give me!
-[IRUMA] I'm not done yet!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:12.542
[ALL panting]

00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:23.542
That was so much fun!

00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:26.500
Just look at us.
We all got a bit too worked up.

00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:29.125
So, this is a sleepover!

00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:31.167
I've never had
so much fun

00:20:31.208 --> 00:20:33.333
right before going to bed!

00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:36.000
Tomorrow, I might not
be able to move.

00:20:36.042 --> 00:20:38.167
Okay. Let's sleep, for real.

00:20:39.292 --> 00:20:43.250
It's ironic.
This already feels like a dream.

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:46.250
I had three new students
join our Battler,

00:20:46.292 --> 00:20:48.708
had a sleepover,
and even made something new.

00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:53.000
I'm sure this Battler Party
will be the best one yet.

00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:54.625
Bet you're right.

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:56.042
[chuckles]

00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:59.542
Iruma, thank you so much.
This has been great.

00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:02.000
Sure!

[IRUMA laughs]

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.417
This is sort of embarrassing.

-Yeah, kinda.

Get some sleep.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.083
I have to take this
real quick.

-Hello--
-[MAN] Again, four eyes!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
What did I say about
letting it ring more than once?!

00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:26.083
Oh, I was just doing some work
with the other members.

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:28.083
[MAN]
Shut up! Don't care!

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.667
You better be getting ready!

00:21:29.708 --> 00:21:31.375
Well, yes, of course I am!

00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:32.875
[MAN]
Now, listen.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.042
Don't screw this up.

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:36.667
Us two are gonna destroy

00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:38.792
the demon school
Babyls together.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.458
They're holding Sullivan
after the tip I gave them.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.333
So he won't be back
at school for a while.

00:21:46.375 --> 00:21:48.625
We've got some
decent pawns now, too.

00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:52.458
The time for us to cause
a storm has come.

00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:57.958
Make sure we have total access
to the machine. Got it?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yes, sir.

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:01.750
It's good to go.

00:23:34.792 --> 00:23:37.125
Su-Ki-Ma!

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:40.833
[videogame noises]

00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.583
[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
Too bad, you lose.

00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:44.583
Aw. I lost again.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.833
You seem to be having fun
despite your loss.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:49.583
Huh? Well, yeah,
I guess I am!

00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:51.375
'cause, I mean, you know,

00:23:51.417 --> 00:23:53.750
I never got the chance
to play fun videogames

00:23:53.792 --> 00:23:55.792
with anyone else before,

00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:57.000
so I'm happy!

00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:00.542
That makes sense.
Let's go another round, then.

00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:02.167
-Yeah!
-Last round, fight!

00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:07.625
Wait, you're almost
out of life, Opera.

00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:09.833
[OPERA] You don't play fair,
Iruma, sir.

00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:11.750
-Really?
-[ELECTRONIC VOICE] You win!

00:24:11.792 --> 00:24:13.458
-[beeping]
-Huh?

00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:18.042
[CLARA] It's almost time
for the Battler Party!

00:24:18.083 --> 00:24:21.167
We're all gonna have tons
of fun playing together!

00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:22.917
We're gonna shoot fireworks
like boom!

00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:25.875
And then shout
“Kaboom-Boom-Blooey!”

00:24:25.917 --> 00:24:29.708
Next time,
"Kiriwo's Secret Room."

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.583
What's this about
Kiriyan's secret room?

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:34.292
Secret? Sugar? Sweets?

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:36.000
I'm gonna eat some sweets, too!
