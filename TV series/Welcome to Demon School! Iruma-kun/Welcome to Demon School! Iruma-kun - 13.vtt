[NARRATOR]
Battlers:

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.250
Gatherings of
like-minded demons

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:15.417
who all want
to move up the ranks.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:17.583
Basically, they're just clubs.

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:20.375
Iruma has been trying
to decide

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.583
which Battler
would be best to join.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:28.417
A little more to the right.

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.750
Smoke, that side is sagging!

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:31.833
Raise it higher!

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.750
-Yes, boss!
-[BOYS exclaiming]

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:36.042
[AMERI] This is all because
you don't train enough.

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:38.500
Nobody's going home
until we're done decorating.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:39.792
[BOYS]
Yes, boss!

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:41.458
The president's more fired up

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.667
than usual this year.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.208
Well, it's not surprising.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.458
Asmodeus would be an asset

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.042
to any Battler,
don't you agree?

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:48.208
-Yeah.
-[SUNNY/SMOKE] For sure.

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:00.917
There.

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:05.542
Decorations inspired
by First Love Memories.

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.667
I wonder if Iruma
will like them.

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:09.042
[chuckles]

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Hey, come by soon!

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.792
[phone beeping]

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.333
Oh, it's Ameri.

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.500
[AMERI] Where are you?
Aren't you stopping

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.292
by the student council?

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.375
[IRUMA] Thank you very much
for the invitation.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.917
I'll stop by later.

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.250
[AMERI]
See that you do.

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:32.833
[IRUMA] So, Ameri,
I can't believe

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.250
you're student council
president!

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:37.000
I honestly had no idea.

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.000
[BOY] [screaming]
Oh no!

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:41.000
[explosion booms]

[grunting]

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.792
Huh? What the...

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.125
[clinking]

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:55.625
[screams, grunts]

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:58.583
[BOY] [coughs]
Well, that failed.

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.875
[coughing]

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.875
Oh, hey.

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:08.792
Oh, it's you again.

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:13.750
-Hey, you alright there?
-Yeah, perfectly fine...

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.042
[IRUMA]
No, you're not!

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.792
[NARRATOR]
Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.625
One day, he found himself
the grandson

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.167
of a demon named Sullivan.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.417
Sullivan loves
and spoils Iruma

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.167
and is even sending him
to the most prestigious school

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:30.417
in the land.

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.542
But there's just one problem.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:34.333
The school Iruma is attending

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:35.875
just so happens to be

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:38.917
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.250
[IRUMA] I can't ever
let them find out I'm human,

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:43.208
or I'm gonna get eaten
for sure!

00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.333
[IRUMA/ASMODEUS/CLARA]
"The Magical Apparatus Battler."

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.458
[AMERI]
He seriously didn't know?!

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.542
I was under the impression
he was already aware

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.833
I was the student council
president!

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.583
Maybe he's intimidated
by my being

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:31.375
in a position
of such authority?

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:33.250
-[phone beeps]
-Uh?

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:34.500
"I'm really sorry.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.125
"Something important
suddenly came up,

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.167
and I won't be able
to visit today."

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:40.458
Aww, so he is scared of me!

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:46.333
[BOY]
Sorry about that.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:49.500
I messed up when trying to
calibrate a magical apparatus.

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:50.500
[IRUMA]
Ah...

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:53.000
I haven't introduced myself yet.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:54.958
My name is Kiriwo Amy.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.417
A pleasure to meet ya.

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.125
I'm Iruma. It's a pleasure
to meet you as well.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.583
I'd offer you Hell Grey Tea
if I could.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.042
See, I'm the only member
of this Battler.

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:06.458
Think nothing of it.
Please, just get some rest.

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.417
That feels amazing.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:15.042
[IRUMA] So this is
the Magical Apparatus Battler.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.750
[KIRIWO]
Sorry, it's kind of a mess.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:19.375
Have a look around,
if you wanna.

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:20.875
[IRUMA]
Thank you, that's very kind.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.250
You probably
know this already,

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:29.208
but these apparati use
magical energy to function.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.292
Right.
[nervous chuckle]

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:32.792
I didn't!

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.250
Exactly as the name
of the Battler indicates,

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:37.708
we study magical apparati
from all over

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.542
and are thus inspired
to make our own magic items.

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:41.750
Whoa, really?

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:43.375
You make
that collar, too?

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:49.750
Uh, actually, this collar's
a bit different.

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:50.958
Here, check this out!

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.375
This ball shines
when you store magic in it.

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:55.375
Aah!

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:56.458
Hup!

00:05:58.208 --> 00:05:59.375
Whoa!

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:00.833
[coughs]

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:02.167
-[KIRIWO groans]
-[IRUMA gasps]

00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:03.292
Are you okay?

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:07.667
Perfectly fine.
This happens all the time.

00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:09.292
All the time?

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:11.125
[KIRIWO] And here's
a doll that moves

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.250
when you infuse it
with magic.

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.792
Hup!

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.167
Wow! Cool!

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:17.167
[coughs]

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:19.458
I've, reached my... limit.

00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:23.125
Please, don't overdo it!

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:25.750
Well, since you came by,
I wanted to show you

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.125
at least a few of
the things we've got here.

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.292
But as you can see,
I'm rather frail,

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:31.958
and I don't have much magic.

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:34.333
[IRUMA] I thought
I was the only one

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:35.958
who had to worry
about that problem

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.083
since I'm human and all.

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:39.458
Guess I was wrong.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.375
Not to mention, I blew up
an apparatus prototype

00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:45.292
I had been tinkering with.

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:47.500
Oh, were you able to get it
working again?

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:49.375
Ahh! You wanna see it?!

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:50.750
Sure!

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:52.292
Dadadada!!

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:53.875
It's my prototype!

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:56.625
The magic enhancement
apparatus, Gabuko!

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.583
Ga-what?

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.417
Just like its name suggests,

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:02.167
it's supposed to enhance
one's magic.

00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:04.583
But it's rather difficult
to use.

00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:10.458
[IRUMA] Are these parts for it?
They look like puzzle pieces.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.292
Yup. Would ya wanna
touch 'em?

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:14.333
Don't mind if I do!

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:17.042
That piece is part
of the battery for its heart.

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.667
It's actually supposed
to be heart-shaped,

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.875
but I can't seem to get
the turbie's spin

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.208
and the ancha's heat capacity
to connect.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.208
Oops, I bet this just sounds
like babbling to you.

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:29.958
No way!

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.583
Wow! Assembled
on your first try!

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.042
-You're amazing, Iruma!
-Aw, it was--

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:38.500
Have you ever made
any of these things before?

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.667
Huh? Well, I, uh--

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.083
Go on, I wanna hear
all about--

00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:44.000
-[coughs]
-Not again!

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.042
I got a bit overexcited.

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:48.667
But you sure are talented,
Iruma.

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:51.250
Uh, well,
ever since I was little,

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:53.083
I've been good
at building things.

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:57.000
I would fix random appliances
and make my own lightbulbs.

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:58.542
Lots of stuff.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:00.833
If I don't fix this,
I'll die!

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:03.333
Ap-what? I don't know
what those are,

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:05.000
but it sounds like
you've had it rough.

00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:06.500
[laughs]

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:09.000
So, uh,
think that'll work now?

00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:10.333
Definitely!

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:12.375
Could you bring me that ball
I showed you?

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:13.333
Yeah!

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:26.708
This time, for sure.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.875
[straining]

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:30.375
[IRUMA]
It's glowing!

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:31.917
[KIRIWO]
Almost there.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:40.708
At last, it worked!

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.417
-Oh wow! So pretty!
-[KIRIWO chuckles]

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:44.667
Isn't it though?

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:47.250
Gabuko's truly
an amazing machine.

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:48.917
Even if you don't have
much magic,

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.625
it can draw out the most
of what you do have.

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:53.750
It's hard to survive
in the netherworld

00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:55.542
for those
without magic to spare.

00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:58.042
Currently, what's valued
most in this world,

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.167
and in this school,
is one's rank.

00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:02.375
The hierarchy is clear.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.625
If possible, I wanna create
magical apparati

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:07.000
that will allow weaker demons

00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:09.250
a level playing field
with the stronger ones.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:12.875
It's my wish
that this will help close

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:14.333
the power gap for good.

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.625
[IRUMA]
Close the power gap.

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.833
Huh, is that really possible?

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.375
[KIRIWO]
You did such a good job.

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:28.042
You have an amazing dream,
Kiriwo!

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:31.083
Well, I can't talk about it
too loudly yet.

00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:34.458
I'm pretty sure
it's the very last thing

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.792
high-ranking demons
want to hear.

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:39.542
But anyway, Iruma,
you have plenty of magic

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:41.000
and are so talented!

00:09:41.042 --> 00:09:42.708
Any Battler would have you!

00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:47.792
Can I ask you a question,
Kiriwo?

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:49.125
Hmm?

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:52.292
Well, supposing I didn't have
any magic,

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.833
could I still join
this one?

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:01.000
If you actually
didn't have any magic,

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:02.750
we'd be just alike!

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:03.875
[gasps]

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:08.542
[KIRIWO]
Even if you had a little,

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:11.625
I'd love to have someone
as gifted as you, Iruma!

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.250
What this Battler needs
far more than magic

00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:15.667
is technique!

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:16.750
[chuckles]

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.667
-[CLARA] Iruma-kins!
-[ASMODEUS] Iruma, sir!

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:26.958
-Iruma-kins!
-Master Iruma!

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:30.542
He got separated from us while
we were at the school store.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.167
Where could he have gone?

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.417
-Iruma, sir!
-Oh! There he is! Hey!

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.958
Iruma-kins!

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.208
Where'd you run off to?

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.708
We missed you bad!

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.792
Oh. Iruma-kins, did something
good happen to you?

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:47.000
Yeah! Listen to this.

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.417
[inaudible dialog]

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.250
[humming]

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:00.375
[chuckles]

00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:02.750
[NARRATOR]
And then, the final day

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.458
of the Battler trials arrived.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.125
[explosions booming]

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.458
[coughing]

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.500
[moaning]
I messed up again.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:13.042
Are you okay?

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.042
Iruma.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.917
You came
to visit me again?

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.750
Were you interested
in joining?

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.208
Huh? There's more of you?

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.208
When I told them I'd decided
to join this Battler,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.375
they insisted
on joining along with me.

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:29.167
Of course!
As promised,

00:11:29.208 --> 00:11:31.917
I shall accompany you
anywhere, Master Iruma!

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.833
Is this magic?
Can I eat it?

00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:36.750
[whimpering]

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:39.583
Well, anyway,
we're all joining up.

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:40.875
Hope it's okay.

00:11:40.917 --> 00:11:42.875
New recruits.

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:44.417
Three of them.

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:45.750
Three of them!

00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:47.000
Are you alright?!

00:11:47.042 --> 00:11:48.167
Wake up!

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.958
[CLARA]
Just look at that smile!

00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:54.167
[NARRATOR] Iruma,
Asmodeus, and Clara

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:57.125
officially joined
the Magical Apparatus Battler.

00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:00.083
Thus ends
the Battler trial period.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.500
That's right.
It's totally over.

00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:06.208
I've honestly never seen
the president so depressed.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.042
Well, that's because Asmodeus
was a big no-show.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:13.583
[AMERI] I can't believe
Iruma never showed up.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.458
[knock on door]

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.417
Enter!

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:21.375
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:23.667
I-Iruma!

00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:27.292
Wha-what do you want?
Didn't you hear?

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:28.625
The trial period's over.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.125
You're right to be mad.
Sorry again.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.833
I mean, honestly. What am I
going to do with you?

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:36.125
You might as well stay
and have some tea.

00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:38.417
Oh, thank you very much.

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:42.417
The student council room.

00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:46.875
Oh! This is from
First Love Memories!

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.458
Uh, yes.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.625
To make potential recruits
feel more welcome.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:52.667
What do you think?

00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:54.667
I think it's just fantastic!

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:56.333
[relieved sigh]

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.708
Oh, I see.

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:00.167
[IRUMA] I was surprised
when I found out

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.167
that you were
the student council president,

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:03.500
To hold that position

00:13:03.542 --> 00:13:06.292
when you're only
a second-year is incredible!

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:08.042
It's not a big deal.

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:12.125
All I'm doing is whatever
I need to do to achieve my goal.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.708
Your goal?

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.417
[KIRIWO] It's my wish
that this will help close

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:17.875
the power gap for good.

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:20.875
The leader of the Battler
I just joined up with,

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.375
he's working really hard
for his goal, too.

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:26.500
Did you really just tell me
you joined another Battler?!

00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:28.750
But you said you'd join
the student council!

00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:29.917
Wait, what?!

00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.500
Uh, I'm pretty sure
that I never--

00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:33.542
Well, you basically
implied as much!

00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:34.958
Explain yourself, Iruma!

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.458
[screaming]

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.083
[NARRATOR] After this,
it took Iruma two hours

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:42.125
to explain the situation
to Ameri.

00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:53.792
[IRUMA/ASMODEUS/CLARA]
"The Thirteen's Dinner."

00:13:57.208 --> 00:13:58.958
[IRUMA]
The Battler Party?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.583
[OPERA] It's a presentation
the Battlers put on,

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.083
but really,
it's a meet-and-greet

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:04.458
for the new members.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.917
It's a lively event

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.042
with all kinds
of shops and amusements.

00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:09.458
Wow!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.625
Above all, the parents
of the first-years

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.542
come to the Battler Party
to observe what goes on.

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:17.042
It's a perfect opportunity
to check up on their kids

00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:19.167
who are just starting school.

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:22.292
So it's basically
like parents' day.

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:23.583
I get it!

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.333
-Why?
-The chair-demon insisted

00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:28.500
on getting you ready
for it right away.

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:30.833
I need uncut footage
from all angles

00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:32.500
of my precious Iruma
getting ready

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:33.750
for the Battler Party!

00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:34.833
We're going big!

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.500
Set everything up!

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.125
[nervous chuckle]

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:40.000
So, where's Grandpa, anyway?

00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:42.125
He just left moments ago.

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:44.750
There's an important regularly
scheduled meeting today.

00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:46.917
Uh? What kind of meeting?

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:49.917
[OPERA] A gathering
of the greatest heroes

00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.167
of the netherworld,

00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:52.542
The Thirteen's Dinner.

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:55.625
[lightning cracking]

00:14:57.167 --> 00:15:00.750
[thunder rumbling]

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.000
Now, then,
let us begin the meeting.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:21.583
Wait, please. It doesn't look
as though everyone's here yet.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:25.125
I'm afraid Asmodeus
and Glasya will be absent.

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:26.500
Yet again?

00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:28.875
How're they still part
of the Thirteen Crowns?

00:15:28.917 --> 00:15:31.417
[BELZEBUTH] They had
other matters to attend to.

00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:34.750
Now, this meeting
will officially commence.

00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:38.792
The biggest problem we face here
is the overhunting of food.

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:41.708
At this rate, we're going
to die of starvation.

00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:46.458
You know, you could do
with a little starving!

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.875
Money's not flowing
like it should, either.

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.625
There's been far
too much illegal trading

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:52.917
of goods going on.

00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.208
Speaking of illegal,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.875
more and more
high-ranked demons

00:15:56.917 --> 00:15:58.625
have been
coming through, too.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.292
The situation is dire.

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.875
The east is getting
dangerous, too.

00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:04.083
What say you, girl?

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:10.417
I don't know what kind
of pluck nonsense

00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:11.667
you're talkin' 'bout.

00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:13.542
Why don't y'all do
somethin' about it?

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:16.042
There's that
bumpkin accent again.

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:18.292
-Heeeh?!
-Heeeh?!

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:19.917
[BOTH]
Heeeh?!

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.250
-Heeeh?!
-[sighs]

00:16:22.292 --> 00:16:25.167
Because we've been without
a Demon King for so long,

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.792
order in the netherworld
has been crumbling away.

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:31.833
We've got the Lord Belial,
Lord Sullivan,

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.000
and, of course, Lady Levi.

00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:36.917
It's about time we make one
of them Demon King

00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.083
and have them effectively
take control of the netherworld.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:44.375
I, for one, support Lord Belial.
Sharp as a dragon's fang.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:46.125
I'd prefer Lady Levi.

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:49.083
Her wisdom and leadership are
far greater. Unmatched, even.

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:51.667
But a Demon King needs
to be conniving, too.

00:16:51.708 --> 00:16:54.958
Nah, nah, Sullivan's the one
who's gonna bring the healin'.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.458
It's true that Sullivan
is quite skilled.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.667
But he's not a Yodh yet.

00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:02.500
Besides, it's not healing
that we need now.

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:04.333
That ain't true,
it was mentioned

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:05.750
in the Prophecy Scroll.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.542
"He shall make one
and all his servants.

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:13.542
He shall form blood pacts,
and heal all demonkind."

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:15.208
Indeed. With the words,

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.250
"He shall descend
from a foreign realm,

00:17:17.292 --> 00:17:20.083
wearing the golden Ring
of Solomon on his right hand."

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:24.167
You guys are
a stone-cold pack of morons.

00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:26.125
After all that whining,
you're just relying

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:27.917
on some lame prophecy?

00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.667
[ALL grumble]

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:31.500
It's not like these
little ripples are going

00:17:31.542 --> 00:17:33.417
to make any waves
on the netherworld.

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.000
