00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.583
But there's barely anything!

00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:51.083
Also, the school lunches
are free for us all,

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:53.583
and you can buy other items
at the school store.

00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:56.292
Hey, uh, I'm not sure
what to get.

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:57.792
Would you help me decide?

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.000
Yes. I'll make
some random selections

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.417
and bring them over to you.

00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.208
If there's anything
you don't like, we can share it.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.583
Okay, thanks.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.458
This seat is mine.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.958
[IRUMA] "Share."
Just like a real friend.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.708
Sorry for the wait, sir.

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:18.167
I had trouble deciding
what to get you--

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:19.500
[BOTH scream]

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:21.375
[ASMODEUS]
Did you bring everything?!

00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:23.500
Well, someone ordered
50 servings.

00:16:23.542 --> 00:16:25.458
Fifty servings, you say?

00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:30.542
Such a lowbrow prank.

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:33.000
Master Iruma, please allow me
to dispose of these--

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:34.417
[ASMODEUS gasps]

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:40.000
[IRUMA] Friends. Friends.

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:41.542
[BOY 1] He sure can put it away.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:42.833
[BOY 2] That's a ton of food.

00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:44.000
What an impressive appetite.

00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:45.125
But he's so tiny.

00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:46.250
Yeah, that's hot.

00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:47.667
Iruma sir?

00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:49.292
Hmm? Oh, was I not supposed to?

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:50.750
Should I spit it back out?

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:52.708
Well, no, it's just

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.542
you seem to be awfully hungry.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.750
-You think so?
-[chomping noisily]

00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:59.625
I need to pack it
in while I still can.

00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:01.167
-More please!
-[COOK grunting]

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.792
And seconds.

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.042
Even more!

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:05.125
[COOK groans]

00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.583
No, the chef's down!

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.042
[BOY] He broke the chef.

00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:15.000
That was magnificent.

00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:16.250
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:18.292
[COME-COME] Take with you.

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:20.250
-Oopsie.
-[IRUMA] What in the world?

00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:21.708
Yay, he played with me.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.500
He does it whenever I come
to the school store.

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:24.750
I love him.

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:26.792
[COME-COME]
Not play. Threaten. Threaten!

00:17:26.833 --> 00:17:28.625
You banned from store.

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:31.125
Power replicates what she sees.

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:34.125
Same as stealing.
Must beware this demon.

00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:36.167
Shoplifters stabbed with spear!

00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:37.333
[IRUMA] So violent.

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:38.500
[COME-COME]
Stabby, stab, stab, stab!

00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:39.583
[BOY] Such violence.

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:40.667
[GIRL]
It's the honor student again.

00:17:40.708 --> 00:17:42.250
-[KALEGO] Silence.
-[ALL gasp]

00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:45.167
Honestly, I finally
come back to work,

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:47.792
and some fool is rash enough
to cause troub--

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.042
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:51.792
[grunts]

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.250
Hi, there, professor.

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:54.458
Are you feeling better, now?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.167
How dare you ask
about my well-being?!

00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:58.875
[NARRATOR] Naberius Kalego.

00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:01.375
An instructor Iruma
made his familiar,

00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:03.458
making Kalego despise him.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.083
[KALEGO] Of course it had to be
the last person I wanted to see.

00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:09.958
-Uh, about the other day--
-Don't care!

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.667
Listen well, Iruma.

00:18:11.708 --> 00:18:13.000
I won't be your familiar.

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:14.792
Not now nor ever.

00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:18.042
Don't get a big head
because you restrained me.

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:19.542
[IRUMA] Understood, sir.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:22.958
What's all this rigmarole
about, anyway?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.667
What fresh hell is this?

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.125
Hi, I'm Clara.

00:18:28.167 --> 00:18:29.750
So I went kaboom
in the school store

00:18:29.792 --> 00:18:32.458
and got in trouble,
but Azz-Azz gave me snacks.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.042
You like chocolate, Eggie-teach?

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:35.792
I'll put some in your pocket.

00:18:35.833 --> 00:18:37.625
[NARRATOR]
Obnoxious, plus brash.

00:18:37.667 --> 00:18:39.875
plus spectacularly
inconsiderate,

00:18:39.917 --> 00:18:42.500
equals the type of person
Kalego hates the most.

00:18:42.542 --> 00:18:43.625
I'm leaving.

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:45.000
Wait, Eggie-teach.

00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:46.875
Is it true
you're Iruma's familiar?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:47.833
-[BOY] Seriously?
-[ALL gasp]

00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:48.875
[KALEGO groans]

00:18:48.917 --> 00:18:50.542
Wanna see. I wanna see.

00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:51.875
-I wanna see you be summoned.
-Release me, urchin.

00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:53.375
Iruma-kins, grab that sticker.

00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:54.875
Huh? Oh.

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:56.375
Stick it on your hand.

00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:58.500
-Now throw your hands up.
-Wait, no!

00:18:58.542 --> 00:18:59.500
Don't, that'll turn me--

00:18:59.542 --> 00:19:01.042
-[IRUMA] Ta-da.
-[KALEGO] Ohh!

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.375
[IRUMA gasps]

00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:05.917
-[BOY] He really is a familiar.
-[GIRL] That's him?

00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.583
That's a summoning sticker.

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:09.708
The mini size is 333 bills.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.000
[IRUMA] I-I'm so sorry.

00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:12.625
-So tiny! So cute!
-[KALEGO] Oh, forget it.

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:14.208
-Hey, clap your hands.
-[IRUMA] Huh?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.708
You want me to clap a rhythm?

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.458
[KALEGO] It'll undo
the summoning, you dunce.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.417
-Oh, let's see here.
-[COME-COME] Stab!

00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:21.917
Punish shoplifting.

00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.458
[ASMODEUS] Shoplifting?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.583
Oh, right. This sticker
was merchandise.

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:27.708
[COME-COME] Capital punishment!

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.250
[KALEGO]
Wait! Undo the summoning first!

00:19:30.292 --> 00:19:31.458
[groans]

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.250
[COME-COME]
Pay me or you're stuck here.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.292
-[CLARA grunting]
-Man, that was totally scary.

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:39.917
Well, thank goodness
there was a decoy, then.

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.375
Uh, should we have left him?

00:19:42.417 --> 00:19:44.333
Hey, hey. Want ice cream?!

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:46.333
These were on the ground,
so I picked them up.

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.667
[gasps] What?!

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:49.583
We have to pay for those,
you know.

00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:52.375
But we can take care
of it later, I guess.

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:55.000
[CLARA]
Yay, we have three of 'em.

00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:57.292
-Cheers everyone.
-[IRUMA AND ASMODEUS] Hmm?

00:19:57.333 --> 00:20:00.458
Here's hoping that we all end up
in the same class.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.458
[grunts] Oh, do they
announce that tomorrow?

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.375
Ha, it's unthinkable

00:20:05.417 --> 00:20:07.542
that the master
and I would be separated.

00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:09.458
And don't forget me.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.167
Uh-huh. I hope we'll be in
the same class together, too.

00:20:13.208 --> 00:20:16.875
Yes! I can't wait to spend
my education with you.

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:20.167
It'll be so fun!
Right, Iruma-kins?

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:21.500
[gasps]

00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:25.917
Uh, would you...

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.917
[shudders] Well...

00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.167
would the two of you
please be my friends?!

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:35.958
[gasps] Hmm?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
[BOTH] Aw.

00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:40.833
[IRUMA] Huh?! Did I blow it?

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:42.333
Pardon me, Iruma sir,

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:45.083
but what are these "friends"
you speak of?

00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:46.417
Like mochi?

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.875
[IRUMA] What? You don't know?

00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:49.375
Embarrassingly, no.

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:50.833
Ooey-gooey mochi?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.375
[IRUMA] I see.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.917
So demons have no idea

00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.083
what the concept
of friendship is.

00:20:56.125 --> 00:20:58.208
Tell me, right now.
What are these "friends"?

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.417
What are these ooey-gooey
mochi mochis?

00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:02.333
Uh, well, they're...

00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:04.250
Friends are people
you do cool stuff with

00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:05.958
and tell things to
and eat meals with,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
and they're really
important to you,

00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:09.667
I think.

00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:11.750
So that would make you

00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:14.125
my friend number one,
and friend number two.

00:21:14.167 --> 00:21:16.125
[CLARA] Sweet! I'm number one.

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:18.083
What?! Don't you undermine me.

00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.208
It's patently obvious
I'm number one.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.333
You're both number one.

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:22.667
Then I get to be
the special great one.

00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:24.625
Okay, let's go pay
for that stuff, like we said.

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.042
-[CLARA] Yay!
-[IRUMA gasps]

00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:28.083
Stop suffocating him, will you?!

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.208
[CLARA] No way.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.583
[overlapping chatter]

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:31.792
-Iruma is not your plaything.
-[IRUMA sighs]

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.000
[IRUMA] There's still so much

00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:35.875
I don't understand
about my life at Babyls,

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:39.125
and this world is still
full of doubts and surprises.

00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:41.333
-[CLARA yells]
-But with these two,

00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:43.875
I think I might be able
to enjoy my life at school

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:45.083
a little more.

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:48.167
I just hope
everything will stay peaceful.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:53.042
[SULLIVAN] So, I assume
there are no objections

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:55.708
remaining after
this faculty meeting.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.208
This officially concludes
the class assignments

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.208
for all the new students.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.083
Valac, Asmodeus, and Iruma
will be joining the Misfit Class

00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:05.542
for problem children.

00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:09.042
That's the only acceptable
option for them, obviously.

00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:45.125
Su... ki... ma.

00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.208
