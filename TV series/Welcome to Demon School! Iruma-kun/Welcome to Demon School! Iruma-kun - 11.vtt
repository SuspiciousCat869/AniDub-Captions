[NARRATOR]
Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.667
One day, he found himself
the grandson

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:27.958
of a demon named Sullivan.

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.458
Sullivan loves
and spoils Iruma

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.167
and is even sending him
to the most prestigious school

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:35.417
in the land.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.542
But there is just
one problem.

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.333
The school Iruma is attending

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:40.917
just so happens to be

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.875
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:46.208
[IRUMA] I can't ever let them
find out I'm human,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.208
or I'm gonna get eaten
for sure!

Today is,
today is the day

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:32.833
I finally tell him
how I really, truly feel!

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.917
Badump, badump.
Step, step.

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:39.000
Kakeru.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.708
Oh my gosh, I'm so scared.
What should I do?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.125
But no matter how scared I am,
I can't go back now.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.500
Clench!
Shake, shake!

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:52.875
I have to go for it!

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.625
Facing your fears.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:58.708
That was the first time

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.333
I've done something like that.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.375

[IRUMA]
Everyone else was happy, too,

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:20.125
so, of course,
that made me really happy.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.375
[AMERI]
And then what happened?

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:22.500
Huh?

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:24.375
Well, what happened
right after that?

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:26.458
After that?
Uh, well, I...

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:31.417
That's a good question.
What does happen next?

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:34.208
Rin decided to tell Kakeru
exactly how she felt,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.208
and she was waiting for him
in the hallway.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.917
What happens next?
I need to know!

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.417

What are my ambitions?

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.792
Should I just try
to raise my rank again?

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.583
Nice to meet you, everyone!

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.500
I will be your
familiars class teacher,

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:21.708
and my name is...

Robin Balse!

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.458
Thrilled to meet ya!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.333
[IRUMA] This new teacher
seems really motivated

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:31.000
and excited to be here!

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:34.208
Yes, I got so lost
in my preparations

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.625
that I missed
the entrance ceremony.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.750
Oh no!
That day's already passed!

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:43.125
Sorry my first day teaching here
ended up being so delayed!

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.375
My attention span can be
fairly scattered at times,

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:48.667
but I'll make sure
classes are spot on!

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.500
On that note,
let's all do our best together!

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.000
Hip, hip, hooray!

00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:55.833
Oh yeah,
you're the Sharp-teach!

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.375
Now, now, listen carefully.

00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:59.125
If you want to say
that line properly,

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.292
what you'd say
is "sharp focus teacher!"

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.625
I see!
Sharp, sharp, got it!

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.333
Now, let's get started, okay?

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.875
Today's lesson is,

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:09.875
interacting with
your familiars.

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:13.583
[IRUMA] Uh-oh,
this could be a bit tricky.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.542
Pay attention. Your familiar
will be your partner.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.333
You'll be bonded forever.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:20.375

for you all

to an astounding start!

Unlike your pathetic,
slithering familiar,

to walk on!

And behold its massive mane!

And you, behold

And would you make it snappy,
please? Thanks!

chunky or smooth?

we've received another complaint

just a bit too harsh on them.

No matter what reason arises,

dignity when teaching.

Hey now!
You can't stop just like that!

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.125
[IRUMA/KALEGO]
Huh?

00:09:56.167 --> 00:09:58.583
The Babyls Teachers' Guidelines!

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:02.625
"Remain dignified
and no special exemptions!"

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:06.375
No matter what reason comes up,
it's my sworn responsibility

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:08.917
to always be dignified
when I'm teaching students.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.250
[NARRATOR]
If you hadn't guessed,

00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:12.208
the one who wrote
the Babyls Teachers' Guidelines

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.917
was of course Kalego the fami--

00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.833
uh, Kalego himself.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.417
[KALEGO grumbles]

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:19.333
This is Professor Robin's

any idea

00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.625
that's actually
Professor Kalego.

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:24.500
We should probably tell him,
you think?

00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:25.750
-Hmm?
-Nah, let's keep quiet.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.250

way too good.

Isn't that Professor Familiar?

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:36.083
Ah! That's Kalego?

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.250
How does he turn
into something so cute?!

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:40.958
I guess that Iruma kid
must have summoned him again.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Iruma's here?
Where, show me?!

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.292
[DOSANKO]
Oh my!

00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:47.958
Shame on you,
you naughty wind.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.458
Oh.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.958
[grumbles]

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.458
[whimpers]

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:01.292
I highly object
to being your familiar.

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.583
You must know this.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:03.708
Right.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.125
However!

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:06.625
It goes against my policy

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.250
to disturb an institute
of learning

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.208
for purely personal reasons.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.625
Therefore...
in every lesson henceforth,

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.042
only get the
highest score possible!

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:18.292
You will continually achieve
all high scores

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:21.417
and obtain far more credits
in supplemental classes.

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:22.750
Don't you dare mess up
in front

00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:24.333
of that silly,
blathering sprite.

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.208
-Got it?
-Got it!

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.625
Huh. First, I'll drill
the basics into your head.

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:30.625
Right!

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.292
The blood pact runs deep.

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:37.583
A summon
from the master is absolute.

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:41.667
Its shape, size, and form is
also influenced by its master.

00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:44.042
[IRUMA] The familiar
is influenced by its master.

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:46.292
Yeah, I see the resemblance!

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.375
Which means
I'm in this ridiculous,

00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:50.083
humiliating incarnation

00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:52.750
entirely because of you!

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:56.625
Also, the only time a familiar
must truly obey its master

00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:58.458
is when it is summoned.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.292
Remember that.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.792
Hey, you guys!

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:04.333
-Let's play with this thing!
-[ALL] Huh?!

00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:07.417
It's perfect to help build trust
with your familiar!

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:09.542
Oh yeah! I wanna play!

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:10.708
Fal, fal, fal.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.708
Haha! Excellent job, there!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.750
Okay, you guys are up next.

00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:21.917
I'm now expected to fetch?

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.583
I couldn't ask you to do that.

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:26.167
I see. So you won't do it.
That's too bad,

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.917
I'll just have to bring down
your score.

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.417
-What?!
-What?!

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:30.667
[KALEGO]
Game on.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:31.792
Really, are you sure?

00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:34.667
[KALEGO]
Throw it already.

00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:36.208

a really good job!

you think it will!

later for sure.

Uh, thank you very much.

00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:22.875
Ah, wonderful job,
just wonderful!

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:26.000

on your shared success!

00:13:26.042 --> 00:13:27.583
O-okay.

-Huh?

It wasn't an emergency,

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:03.250
but I still had to summon you
and put you through so much.

00:14:03.292 --> 00:14:04.667
I'm sorry, Professor.

00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:09.375
Hey. When you were about
to be attacked

00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:11.583
by the Guardian
of Cutthroat Valley,

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:13.792
why didn't you think
to summon me then?

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:18.833
Do I appear weak to you?

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:20.667
Oh, no, no,
it's nothing like that!

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:22.042
I just didn't want
to burden you!

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:23.708
And besides,
I thought, well...

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.958
Well what?

00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.792
I thought if,
if I had summoned you,

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.917
either you or the Guardian
of Cutthroat Valley

00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.292
might have ended up hurt.

-Huh?

00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:39.375
This is a waste of time!

Let us settle the matter
the proper way, by force!

Hey, hey, hey!

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.042

Aah!

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.792
[KALEGO]
Pathetic.

00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:09.542
[KALEGO] Take a good look
around you, idiots!

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.542
-Hey, newbie.
-Yes?

00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:16.083
Explain why trust is so crucial
between masters and familiars.

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:19.083
Huh? Well, a familiar
is a servant and--

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.125
[KALEGO]
Wrong!

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:22.750
It's so no one is devoured.

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:27.000
But if a familiar disobeys,
they're punished.

00:15:27.042 --> 00:15:29.833
-This isn't about the masters.
-Huh?

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:33.083
I'm talking about
everyone around them.

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:34.167
Around them?

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:38.583
[KALEGO] Familiars are
neither pets nor partners.

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.458
They are magical beasts
who can instantly turn violent

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.875
if their masters falter.

00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:46.583
Fear your familiars,
you brats.

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:48.917
That is what true trust is.

00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:53.417
It appears that only one
of you, inexplicably,

00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:55.500
had the right idea
about this.

00:15:56.917 --> 00:15:58.958
If you understand,
then start treating

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.292
your familiars with respect!

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.667
-Right now!
-Sir, yes, sir!

00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:06.875
[NARRATOR] And thus, interaction
with the familiars was modified,

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:09.667
and both entities
became closer.

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.875

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.000
worthy enough
to be in my league.

00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:38.167
-Huh?
-[DOSANKO giggles]

00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.333
[IRUMA groans]

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:40.500
Iruma, sir!

00:17:40.542 --> 00:17:42.375
Such insolence! Out!

00:17:42.417 --> 00:17:43.917
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.500
Are you hurt at all, Master?

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:46.583
No, I'm fine.

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.167
Iruma?
You're here, too?

00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:49.667
Aren't you the one who...

00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:51.250
[ALL]
Huh?

00:17:51.292 --> 00:17:53.083
Who's the evil demon
who has teachers

00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.750
at his beck and call, controlled
the Guardian of the Valley,

00:17:55.792 --> 00:17:57.042
and attacked his classmate?!

00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:58.708
[IRUMA] That story's gotten
a bit embellished!

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.542
Don't get too close,
he'll attack you!

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:01.792
[IRUMA]
Wait a sec.

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:03.292
What? But how could he...

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.292
Your rank is Alef, isn't it?

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:06.792
[ALL]
Huh?!

00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:08.750
Oh, in that case,
it's whatever.

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:11.833
Oh, Asmodeus! Your Dalet badge
is devi awesome!

00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:13.208
What's the Misfit Class like?

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.667
I bet you're
the coolest one there.

00:18:14.708 --> 00:18:16.250
Wanna get on the scale
of love with me,

00:18:16.292 --> 00:18:17.792
'cause time's a-wastin'!

00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:20.208
[CLARA] [grunts]
You're all wrong!

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.417
Iruma-kins just became
a Bet the other day!

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:24.583
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:25.583
[HARUNO]
You're right!

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:27.875
So sorry!
We jumped the gun.

00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:31.583
We didn't know you were a Bet.
That is pretty impressive.

00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:33.208
You should come talk to us.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.625
Uh, okay.

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.375
Now that I've gotten
a better look at you,

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:37.708
you're kinda cute.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.000
[growls]

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:41.000
[alarm blaring]

00:18:41.042 --> 00:18:42.625
Huh? What's that sound?

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:44.250
Crap! Let's go.

00:18:44.292 --> 00:18:46.000
Yeah. Bye-bye, now!

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.250
See you later!

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.750
See you soon.

00:18:48.792 --> 00:18:50.000
Uh, sure.

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:52.042
Don't let the door hit ya!

00:18:52.083 --> 00:18:54.458
So those girls were pretty
intense, wouldn't you say?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.500
Honestly, Master, how dare
they treat you like that?

00:18:57.542 --> 00:18:59.167
Though I guess
it can't be helped

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.250
that they assumed
you were still an Alef.

00:19:01.292 --> 00:19:02.458
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.750
Uh, nothing!

00:19:05.083 --> 00:19:08.542
I guess ranks matter more
to demons than I thought.

00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:10.750
But why'd they run out
of here so quickly?

00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:11.875
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:12.792
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:19:12.833 --> 00:19:14.208
Feast your eyes.

00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:17.333
[IRUMA]
What is it?

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.917
[ASMODEUS]
I brought you to the cafeteria

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.167
because I want
to discuss it with you.

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:24.250
-Battlers?
-Indeed.

00:19:24.292 --> 00:19:26.208
They're a group that
basically concentrates

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.458
on the sole purpose
of raising their ranks higher.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.333
Students who possess
similar talents, interests,

00:19:32.375 --> 00:19:34.792
and ideals get together
and network.

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:39.250
For example, Flight Battlers.
Magic Creature Battlers.

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:43.375
Pharmaceutical Studies Battlers.

00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:45.417
Magic, wisdom, strength

00:19:45.458 --> 00:19:47.458
are all things they train
to improve in

00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:49.208
as well as leadership courses.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.708
Being Battlers helps them
raise their ranks.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.708
Huh.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.125
[ASMODEUS]
There's a group promotion exam

00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:56.708
reserved for Battlers,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.333
but it's possible
to raise your rank

00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:00.000
through personal
achievements, too.

00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:03.250
About 60 percent
of the student body

00:20:03.292 --> 00:20:05.125
is in some kind
of Battler group,

00:20:05.167 --> 00:20:07.167
and it's also great
for forging connections

00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:08.167
with upperclassmen.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.750
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:13.083
Group activities where you're
with upperclassmen, huh?

00:20:15.333 --> 00:20:17.167
I get it!
They're clubs, right?!

00:20:17.208 --> 00:20:19.583
-A club?
-The chubs?

00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:21.792
[ALL]
Fifty-nine.

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.417
Clubs,
how about that?

00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:25.542
I was always too busy
to join any.

00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:28.500
The idea intrigued me,
but I never got around to it.

00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:31.833
If you are interested,
then I shall go with you!

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:34.542
Although I'm not quite sure
what clubs are.

00:20:34.583 --> 00:20:35.583
Oh, uh...

00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:37.125
Let's get you to Gimel.

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:39.333
No, wait,
we'll move you Dalet!

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:40.750
I'm sure
this will assist you

00:20:40.792 --> 00:20:42.542
in raising your rank,
Iruma, sir!

00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:43.583
We'll help you!

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:45.208
Oh, right. The ranks,

00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:48.708
I just thought of them
as practice

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.292
to create goals for myself,
and I worked really hard

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.208
to become a Bet.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:56.583
I wonder if rising to Gimel
should be my next goal.

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:59.667
It feels like I'm just going
with the flow again.

00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:02.125
But now, I know
how great it is to have one goal

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:04.500
to focus all your energy on.

00:21:04.542 --> 00:21:07.750
On the other hand,
maybe I can find true ambition

00:21:07.792 --> 00:21:09.667
through the Battlers
and go even further!

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:17.542
Right now, I want to push myself
and try new things!

00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:20.458
Yeah! Let's find the Battlers!
I'd love to!

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.458
-Yay, yay, yay!
-As you wish, master.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.417
[IRUMA] A real club!
They're sorta like this, right?

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:27.333
[ASMODEUS] Now that
that's settled, Iruma, sir.

00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:28.375
Uh-huh?

00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:29.458
Sit right here.

00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:31.833
Um, what am I...

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.500
I knew it was smart
to bring you here

00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:35.083
to the cafeteria!

00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:37.792
We'll have a good view of
the entrance from this position.

00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:38.708
[IRUMA]
The entrance?

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.833
[alarm blaring]

00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.958
-They've arrived.
-They're coming!

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.458
Hmm?!
What in the--

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.500
You see, the senior Battlers
are on their way here

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:48.208
to recruit
first-year students.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.583
[rumbling]

00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:52.917
[ALL shouting]

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.375
[ASMODEUS]
They call it The Rookie Hunt!

00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:56.625
Where are the first-years?!

00:21:56.667 --> 00:21:59.375
Come out, come out and play,
first-years!

00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:00.875
[screams]

00:22:00.917 --> 00:22:04.125
We're here for you,
first-years!

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.625
[screams]

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:41.042
Su-ki-ma-shashashashasha!

00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:43.250
[EIKO] In order
to get closer to Iruma,

00:23:43.292 --> 00:23:46.000
I, Eiko, have thought up
a brilliant plan.

00:23:46.042 --> 00:23:47.083
It's simple!

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.833
I'm just going to become
good friends

00:23:48.875 --> 00:23:50.667
with Professor Kalego first,

00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:52.667
since he's his familiar!

00:23:52.708 --> 00:23:54.583
I'm a little bit scared.

00:23:54.625 --> 00:23:58.042
But he turns into
such a floofy little familiar.

00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.958
I bet he's really nice.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.333
K-Ka... Professor Kalego!

00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:05.833
What?!

00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:07.833
[echoing]

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:11.000
[NARRATOR] After this,
Eiko spent three hours

00:24:11.042 --> 00:24:13.500
recovering from shock
in an infirmary bed.

00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:18.208
[IRUMA] So I guess being
in the Battlers is like a club.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.583
This will be
my first time working

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:21.417
with my school... friends

00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:23.833
to achieve
a common goal together.

00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:25.542
I'm doing
so many cool things

00:24:25.583 --> 00:24:28.083
I never got to do
in the human world!

00:24:28.125 --> 00:24:30.875
Next time, "The Rookie Hunt."

00:24:30.917 --> 00:24:33.042
I guess there are
all kinds of Battlers.

00:24:33.083 --> 00:24:36.583
Oh, that Battler looks fun.
Ooh, so does that one!

00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:40.208
Wait, where am I?
The Magic Apparatus Battler?
