Nobody's even

What's going on?

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.500
Well, it is a party,

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:49.833
so I figured
I'd go all out.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.667
There are barriers everywhere.

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:54.250
You're the only one
who can do that magic, right?

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:59.333
Right you are. Indeed, I am.

everyone's been enjoyin' them,

although that wasn't
my intention.

They just decided to call it
a surprise event,

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:10.750
which made it even
more amusing than I'd planned.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.292

the fireworks, aren't you?

So, then...

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:28.042
...Kiriwo, what are you planning
to do with the shell?

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:29.875
Why, detonate it, of course!

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.083
So I can blow the school
to smithereens.

How could you?

I guess I'll tell you
my story,

since we're such good friends,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.250
My family, the Amy clan,
is known as the "Steel Barrier"

00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:08.333
and is one
of the most infamous families

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:17.417
However...

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:24.917
Dang it, this ain't good.

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.292
A child with almost
no magical power

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:29.667

into this family?

the Garden of Delinquents.

00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:11.375
It was a correctional
elementary school

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:12.667
for young demons,

00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:14.375

Still, despite all that,

Because of her, I finally knew
what that feelin' was.

Back then, when I saw that
totally crushed expression...

unbelievably excited!

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.083
I just had to come!

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.000
The school's open
'cause of the Battler Party,

00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:12.000
so I figured I'd sneak in.

00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:13.208
[BATTLER MEMBER]
Shut up.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.292
Just who the hell
do you think you--

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:16.667
[moaning]

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:18.250
How many'd you kill
with this?

00:11:18.292 --> 00:11:19.708
What'd you do
with them afterward?

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.125
Did ya throw 'em away
or use 'em for something?

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:24.375
Did it get you excited?

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.000
[ALL]
Huh?

00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:27.917
[MAN yawning]

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.833
Oh, uh, Baal,

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:32.917
Sorry, didn't mean
to wake you up!

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.542
We'll get rid
of this snotty kid!

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:37.500
Who the hell
is this irritating brat?

00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:42.292
Well, sir, I came here
looking for comrades!

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:45.042
-Why, you little...
-Comrades, huh?

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:47.208
Do you see the bandage
I'm wearing?

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.583
It's so I won't forget.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:52.958
Because of me, this girl lost
something really important,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.500
so I gave her one of my horns
to make up for it,

00:11:55.542 --> 00:11:56.917
'cause she said
they were pretty.

00:11:57.875 --> 00:12:02.042
Her expression was a look
of complete and total revulsion.

00:12:02.083 --> 00:12:04.833
Hah! I know it's crazy
to get so jazzed

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:07.375
about someone having the worst
day of their whole life.

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:09.583
I'm a bit messed up,
obviously, but still--

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:10.750
Stop.

00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.750
That doesn't seem crazy
to me at all.

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.500
Huh?

00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:18.750
In fact, that's what you'd call
"going back to basics."

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.833
What do you mean by that?

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.958
[BAAL] It's how
all demons used to be.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.417
[KIRIWO]
Really?

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:29.583
[BAAL] You've just retained
more of that purity

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:31.083
than most other demons.

00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:35.125
That said,

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.417
I totally get
how you feel.

00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:45.583
Sit back and listen
for a sec.

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:48.167
You don't hear screaming
or ferocious roars

00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:49.833
in the netherworld anymore.

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:52.375
It's so pleasant,
I wanna puke.

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:55.542
That's why we of
the Magical Apparatus Battler

00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.583
are trying to return
the netherworld

00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:59.792
to its original state
of chaos.

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.625
That's my true ambition.

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:03.083
Chaos, huh?

00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:07.250
This is something
the demons who join

00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:08.917
the MagiApp Battler drink

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.625
so they can share
in the common goal

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:12.458
we're all striving toward.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:17.042
What do you say, brat?
You want to help me achieve it?

00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.833
Follow me now
and I'll make sure

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:20.417
you get to see it.

00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:23.125
You'll witness
the ultimate despair!

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:25.375
[gasps]

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:27.500
[gulps]

00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:33.042
From then on, I'd see Bro
every now and again,

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:36.042
and he'd give me
all these cool things,

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:38.208
not to mention
valuable knowledge.

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:40.792
After some time had passed

00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:43.375
since my enrollment
at the demon school Babyls,

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:46.333
my Bro told me
something really interesting.

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:48.333
We're going to get rid
of the ranks

00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:51.042
that give order
in the netherworld, Kiriwo.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.333
[KIRIWO]
Altogether?

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.667
I was so ecstatic.

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:58.667
Because of the existence
of the ranking system,

00:13:58.708 --> 00:14:01.000
everyone listens
to those above them.

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:05.250
But if we turn
those stairs into cliffs,

00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:07.625
then chaos would truly
take over!

00:14:08.667 --> 00:14:11.750
So we decided to obliterate
the demon school Babyls,

00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:13.833
the very symbol
of ranks itself.

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:17.125
Using the fireworks
will be flashy and beautiful.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.292
Thanks to Gabuko,
I'm certain it'll be

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:23.083
quite a spectacular explosion.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:26.417
You've created something
truly wonderful, Iruma.

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:29.667
I believe it must've been fate
that brought us two together!

00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:31.833
Now I can see
my objective realized.

00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:33.000
Cower.

00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:34.708
The students are
mindlessly enjoying

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.417
this big "surprise,"

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.417
and they can't wait to see
what's gonna happen next.

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:42.333
Those faces beaming
with joy and anticipation.

00:14:43.292 --> 00:14:45.792
Soon, they'll all turn
to anguish.

00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:48.917
And once the parents
who show up to the Party

00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.208
see the horrible condition
of their poor children,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.125
they'll scream
in agony and rage!

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:54.042
Cower!

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.208
They'll all fall

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.708
into the depths
of despair!

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.625
[giggles]

00:14:58.667 --> 00:15:00.833
Sure, I could've stopped you
from coming in here

00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:04.708
with my barriers if I wanted to,
but I chose to let you in.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.875
And do you wanna know why?

00:15:06.917 --> 00:15:09.083
It's because I wanna watch
the fireworks

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.708
specifically with you.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.583
Cower in fear,
tremble before me.

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:15.625
Your friends Azz and Clara,

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:18.667
you get to witness the most
important people in your life

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:20.125
shatter before your eyes!

00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:25.125
Yes, I'll stuff you into a box
made of barriers

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:27.333
and watch you plunge
into despair.

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:29.042
Ugh! Drown in regret.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:32.083
It's okay. Hate me as much
as you're able to!

00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:34.083
Even hit me if you want!

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:36.917
But I have to see it,
so please, show me!

00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.750
Your despair-filled face!
Show me!

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.167
Huh?

00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:53.375
That settles it.

00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:55.375
Would you excuse me a sec?

00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:58.083
[grunting]
Upsy-daisy.

what I just said?

I'm gonna blow up
the entire school!

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:11.167
Why?! Everything important
to you will be gone!

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:12.583
There'll be nothing left!

00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:14.375
All because
of something you made!

00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:17.042
After all this crap
I just dumped on you,

00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:19.208
why aren't you knee-deep
in despair?!

00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:23.167
Despair is a waste of time!
Nothing good comes of it.

[gasps]

00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:28.458
I've been through hell
in my life, so I'm used to it,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.458
you know?

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:34.875
Despairing won't change
the situation or fulfill me.

00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:36.458
I make my own happiness.

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:39.500
[NARRATOR]
This entire time,

00:16:39.542 --> 00:16:43.000
Kiriwo thought he
and Iruma were exactly alike.

00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:45.083
He was mild-mannered
and well-guarded,

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.792
yet had ambition.

00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:49.000

as I could to avoid danger.

But since coming here,

to challenge myself.

I won't run away.

actually exist?

No. Give it back
this instant.

the beginning of Party Day.

before, Kiriwo.

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:15.750
[KIRIWO] [chuckles]
That's why I called you crazy.

00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:17.375
The barrier surrounding
the school

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:20.458
is more than powerful enough
to withstand the explosion.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.542
You won't break through it
with such lame magic.

00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:25.458
I've waited for this day,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.458
the day I'd see everyone's faces
fill with total despair.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.958
It's the sole reason I created
this ultimate barrier you see!

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.417
The only one with magic
powerful enough

00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:36.958
to break my barriers
is Sullivan,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.958
which sucks for you!

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:40.250
-[IRUMA chuckles]
-Huh?

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.875
[IRUMA]
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:44.417
[SULLIVAN]
This spell will unleash

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:46.333
the magic's full power
at once.

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.958
[IRUMA]
I'm gonna break my promise.

00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:51.167
Pandoroola!

00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:52.083
[ring clinks]

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.542
[barrier shatters]

[STUDENTS]
Sixteen!

00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:19.000
Fifteen! Fourteen!

00:20:19.042 --> 00:20:21.375
Thirteen! Twelve!

00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:22.333
Eleven!

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.125
Ten!

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:27.625
Nine! Eight!

00:20:27.667 --> 00:20:29.000
-Seven!
-Hey, look at that!

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:30.125
[STUDENT]
Huh?

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:31.375
[STUDENTS]
Five!

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.625
-Hey, look up!
-Huh?

00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:38.708
[STUDENTS]
Two! One!

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.042
-[fireworks explode]
-[STUDENTS cheer]

00:20:41.083 --> 00:20:46.333
[bell tolling]

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:55.542
[cheering]

00:20:55.583 --> 00:20:57.375
-Wow!
-What was that?!

00:20:57.417 --> 00:20:58.542
I've never seen that!

00:20:58.583 --> 00:20:59.917
[giggles]
It bloomed!

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.042
-We did it, Master!
-Yay!

00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:04.042
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.250
What?!

00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:16.042
[ROBIN laughs]

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.292
[overlapping chatter]

00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:27.583
Was that for real
or did I just dream it?!

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.583
Like the brilliance of love,

00:21:29.625 --> 00:21:31.833
love I witnessed
that one summer day.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.917
It was so incredible.

00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:36.333
[AMERI]
Did Iruma...

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:37.708
I saw it!

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.083
I saw the fireworks bloom
with my own eyes.

00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:41.792
-[laughs]
-Iruma-kins!

00:21:43.292 --> 00:21:44.333
High five!

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:45.542
What the devi
were those

00:21:45.583 --> 00:21:47.042
bright lights
and sounds about?!

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:48.583
[GOEMON]
It was totally mind-blowing!

00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:50.458
[KIRIWO sobs]

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.250
[KIRIWO]
What the hell?

00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:55.125
Why? Come on,
what the hell happened?!

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:57.958
I was this close,
so why didn't it work?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.292
Everybody's still smiling
down there!

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:03.208
And what was that ridiculous
amount of magical power?!

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.042
How dare you destroy
all the power

00:22:05.083 --> 00:22:06.375
I've been saving up
for years?!

00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:09.250
You're the worst, Iruma!
Dummy!

00:22:09.292 --> 00:22:11.458
How dare you sleep there
so soundly?!

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.833
You didn't even think about

00:22:12.875 --> 00:22:14.375
how you were gonna land,
did you?!

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:16.083
Dummy!

00:22:17.417 --> 00:22:21.042
How dare you really help
all these people, you dummy!

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.167
[exhales]

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.417
We're not alike
in the slightest, are we?

00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:28.833
Guess I lose.

00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:33.833
It's obvious that you're
way more ambitious than I am.

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:36.375
Alright, Iruma,
you got me.

00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:37.458
[snoring softly]

00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:16.708
[DOSANKO]
My name is Dosanko,

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.250
and I'm a preacher of love.

00:24:18.292 --> 00:24:20.583
My best assets are
my big, beautiful eye

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.417
and my overwhelming sexiness.

00:24:22.458 --> 00:24:23.542
Sexiness!

00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:24.708
Just like the flower
that bloomed

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.542
in the night sky, right?

00:24:26.583 --> 00:24:29.125
Next time,
"I Want to Pick Everything Up"

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.083
and "Family Time."

00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:32.958
What I want more
than anything else

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.625
is the greatest love of all.

00:24:34.667 --> 00:24:35.750
Oh, love!

00:24:35.792 --> 00:24:37.250
Yes, fill the world
with love

00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:38.917
along with my gentle kiss!

00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.042
