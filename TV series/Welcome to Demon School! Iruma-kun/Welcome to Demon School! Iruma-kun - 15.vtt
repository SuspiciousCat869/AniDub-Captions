[SUZIE]
Yis, Yis!

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:14.375
I had some first-years join
our Battler again this year!

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:15.500
Oh, yis!

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.417
Heh! I wouldn't get
too excited.

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:20.917
Oh. What exactly
do you mean by that?!

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.458
Only that the first-years

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.792
who joined my Battler
are superior in every way.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.792
Shall we have
a competition, then?

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.417
Very well.
So what did you have in mind?

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:32.542
[BOTH chuckle]

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:33.542
[BOTH]
I know!

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:35.417
Let's have a Battler Party!

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.417
Yay!

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:39.167
Applause!

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.667
Yay!

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:42.000
Clap for the party!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.792
[CLARA]
Something big is starting!

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.875
It would appear
they've put together a video

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:48.625
introducing the Battler Party
to all the first-years.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.333
Oh wow, that seems fun.

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:53.833
[NARRATOR]
Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:55.083
One day, he found himself

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.167
the grandson
of a demon named Sullivan.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.417
Sullivan loves
and spoils Iruma

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.208
and is even sending him
to the most prestigious school

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.542
in the land.

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:06.583
But there's just one problem.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:08.417
The school Iruma is attending

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:09.917
just so happens to be

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.292
[IRUMA] I can't ever let them
find out I'm human,

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.333
or I'm gonna get eaten
for sure!

"Kiriwo's Secret Room."

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.458
-It's a Battler Party!
-It's a Battler Party!

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.708
[SUZIE]
So what is the Battler Party?

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.458
It's a chance
for first-year Battlers

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.917
to do a presentation.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.167
[DALI] It's a three-day event:
the Party Eve,

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.083
Party Day,
and Closing Spectacular.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.667
My, how lovely.

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.875
All students from every grade
are both allowed

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:14.542
and encouraged to participate.

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:17.292
However, upperclassmen will
be busy with their workshops,

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:20.583
so this festival is mostly
for the lower three years.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.667
This is absolutely perfect!
Just what we need.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:25.792
[SUZIE] It'll be held
in the front garden

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.875
and the central plaza.

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.833
[DALI]
Did everybody catch all that?!

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.750
And for you first-years
watching, you're the stars!

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:35.875
Your families are coming
to see you guys, after all!

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.500
It's an excellent opportunity

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:39.583
for parents to see
their kids are thriving.

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:40.875
Hmm.

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:43.583
I wonder if Grandpa
will be there, too.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.542
But let's not forget
about the second

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:46.792
and third-year students.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:48.500
Is there something
for them as well?

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:51.208
There's no need to fear,
Professor Suzie!

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.875
Because, the Battlers that put
on the best performance

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:56.875
will receive fantastic prizes!

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.625

a prize of your choice!

You've already been working hard
on everything else,

it would have worn you out.

And besides,
handling fire is my forte.

to be a chimney?

What's necessary
to pull this plan off

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.083
are your abilities...

with you, Gabuko.

yet the time has flown by.

I'd actually be able to do this.

to make it work.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.917
Thank goodness
it's only you.

00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.083
Upsy-daisy.

00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:12.042
You gave me such a scare
that I was rendered speechless!

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:13.167
-[coughs]
-Oh!

00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:14.583
I-I'm sorry!

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:18.833
How'd ya get
in here anyway?

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:20.042
I, um,

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:21.792
I wanted to talk to you
about tomorrow,

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:24.125
so I went out looking
for you, and well...

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.667
Hmm!

00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:29.417
I wonder where Kiriwo
disappeared to.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:31.875
We need to talk
about tomorrow.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.417
Hmm? Uh?
[yelps]

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:38.417
[screaming]

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:40.792
[STUDENT]
Whoa! H-hey!

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:41.750
[crashing]

00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:43.125
[GIRL screams]

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:45.042
I am so sorry, everyone!

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:48.083
Please, stop.
Let go of me!

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:49.333
[groans]

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:50.333
Huh?!

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.833
-[rumbling]
-Uh?

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:57.083
[whimpering]

00:10:58.042 --> 00:11:01.667
So, yeah, basically,
my ring pulled me here.

00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:04.750
Ah, yes, of course.
That's happened once before.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.500
Yeah. It was when
we first met.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:11.500
I guess it still reacts
despite being so far away.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:13.792
So, what is this place?

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.583
It's my secret base.

00:11:18.542 --> 00:11:20.958
Whoa! Are you serious?!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.042
[KIRIWO]
Iruma.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.458
Come take a look.

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:34.917
Allow me to welcome you
to the MagiApp's graveyard.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:39.375
My senior told me
about this place.

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:46.125
Wait, do you mean the same one
who called you the other day?

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:47.583
Yup.

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:49.292
Apparently, in the old days,

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.833
this Battler used to make
a bunch of weird things

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.167
that would get them in trouble
if they were ever caught.

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:58.583
So they came here
to work on that stuff in secret.

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.583
But all that's left now
is junk.

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:04.125
[IRUMA] Then what were you
getting ready for in here?

00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:06.458
Really wanna know?

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:11.667
Once you know about it,
there ain't no turnin' back.

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:14.333
Ready?

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:15.542
Here goes.

00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:23.500
[IRUMA gasps]

00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:30.333
[IRUMA]
Man, look how high we are!

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.250
[KIRIWO]
Didn't expect that, did ya?

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:35.458
Take a look
just below that tower,

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.458
right in front
of the central plaza.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.542
[IRUMA]
Huh?

00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:41.750
[KIRIWO]
That's the Bell of Ceremonies.

00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:46.750
It rings to signal
the end of the Party Eve,

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:48.833
and then the Party Day begins.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:51.958
[IRUMA]
Look, Professor Kalego.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.250
And isn't that...

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:58.333
Acting Chair-Demon!
[laughs]

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:01.167
I've looked everywhere for you,
Acting Chair-Demon!

00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:04.167
I'm quite certain I told you
to stop calling me that.

00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:06.000
Oh, that's right.

00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:07.917
Then, how about
I call you Chairego!

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.375
No, don't you dare!

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:11.625
[ROBIN] I combined
the first part of Chair-Demon

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:13.708
with the "ego"
from Kalego.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.458
Put them together
and you get Chairego!

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.542
[laughs]
I am so clever!

00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:19.792
[KALEGO]
You really aren't!

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.292
Come on, admit it,

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.875
I know you love
the nickname!

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:25.792
Chu-Air-E-Go, Chairego!

00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:29.125
[ROBIN screaming]

00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:31.792
He's having a fight
with Professor Robin.

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:34.208
And looks more intense
than usual.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.333
[inhales deeply]

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:39.292
Stupid head!

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.167
Kiriwo! What do you think
you're doing?!

00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.667
[laughs]

00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:46.125
-It's no big deal.
-Huh?

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:49.417
This is special glass,
so he can't even hear me.

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:51.750
They can't see us
from the other side, either.

00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:56.042
See? No one's
even noticed us.

00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:57.292
[IRUMA]
You're right.

00:13:58.292 --> 00:13:59.333
[KIRIWO]
Iruma.

00:14:01.042 --> 00:14:03.375
Do you remember
what I told you before?

00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:05.417
I want to create
magical apparati

00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:07.667
that even weaker demons can use

00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:10.875
and make a world where
this power gap doesn't exist.

00:14:11.833 --> 00:14:14.500
From way up here,
you have no idea at all

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:17.458
who's got a high ranking
or low one.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.167
Everybody's equal.

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:20.750
No difference whatsoever.

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.833
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:29.542
My dream is for the whole world
to be this way.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.083
He's so excited.
I've never seen him like this.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.333
-[KIRIWO coughs]
-Aah!

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:38.708
[KIRIWO]
I got myself too riled up.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.417
Y-you might wanna calm down,
you know?

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:45.625
[exhales]

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:47.875
I just felt so happy, there.

00:14:47.917 --> 00:14:50.917
'Cause you're the only one
I can talk to about all this.

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.708
You have
this mysterious essence

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.292
that helps me let
my guard down.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.542
You're not like any
of the other students.

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:00.667
I'm so grateful
I got to meet ya.

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.542
I don't know what to say.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:06.708
Can I ask you
a question, Kiriwo?

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.208
Hmm?

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.208
Well, supposing I didn't
have any magic,

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.917
could I still join
this one?

00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:18.500
If you actually
didn't have any magic,

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.333
we'd be just alike!

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:26.083
Kiriwo, I'm glad
I met you, too!

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:28.625
Maybe, someday...

00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:34.083
...I can tell him
the truth about myself,

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:35.917
and he'll just smile at me.

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.708
And everything will be okay.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.083
-[KIRIWO] Iruma?
-Huh?

00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:44.292
Right! Anyway,
let's just make sure

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:46.125
the fireworks are a hit.

00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:48.333
It's the first step to the world
without a power gap

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:51.083
you've been wishing for
all this time!

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:52.375
Yup, sure is.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.333
In fact, the reason
I came here was

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:58.000
to mentally prepare myself.

00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:01.750
Kiriwo!

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:04.250
Huh?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.583
About that Grand Prize.
Well, we should go for it!

00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:14.417
The grand, uh... what, now?

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:17.125
[gasps]
Maybe...

00:16:17.167 --> 00:16:19.958
yeah, maybe that's
too much for us to handle.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.750
Well, look at it
this way.

00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:26.750
The Grand Prize is normally
taken by a top-class Battler,

00:16:26.792 --> 00:16:30.542
with tons of powerful,
experienced demons in it.

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:32.208
That's basically just
a pipe dream

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.875
for weaklings like us,
so why bother?

00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:37.958
Don't you see?!
It'll be perfect if we win!

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.833
All those
high-ranking demons,

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:43.042
they'll practically die of shock
when they lose to us!

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:44.583
You work so hard!

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:47.375
And I want to prove that
to the whole school!

00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:48.917
See what I mean?

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.792
We have no choice!

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:54.583
It's the only way
we're ever gonna get you

00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:56.875
any closer to your goal!

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:59.042
So, let's go for it!

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:02.542
[KIRIWO]
That's...

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:06.125
[chuckles]

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.292
That's a really wonderful way
of thinkin'.

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:09.917
You sure do say some things

00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.042
I'd have never expected
of you, Iruma.

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:14.167
Oh wow,
you really think so?

00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:16.292
Yeah, you've got pure,
true ambition.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.000
I must say, you and I...

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.792
...we're so much alike,
it's almost scary.

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:30.500
[glass shatters]

00:17:32.042 --> 00:17:33.208
-[IRUMA] Kiriwo?
-Uh!

00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.958
Well, time for us to go.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.250
We can't leave all the
preparatin' to those other two,

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.708
now can we?

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.750
-Something came off!
-I told you,

00:17:42.792 --> 00:17:44.583
that's not how you do it!

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:46.542
Uh, yeah, that's true.

00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:49.208
[KIRIWO] Come on, Iruma.
Hurry it up!

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.667
Hold on, wait for me!

00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:54.542
[KIRIWO] Oh, make sure you keep
this place a secret.

00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:55.583
[IRUMA]
Gotcha.

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:57.750
[KIRIWO]
We've gotta hustle!

00:17:58.792 --> 00:17:59.917
[door closes]

00:18:01.542 --> 00:18:03.750
[giggles]
Try it.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:06.458
-Wait, you silly twit! Ahh!
-I bet you can't catch me!

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.792
[KIRIWO]
Oh, bother.

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:09.875
[IRUMA] This is pretty much
what I expected.

00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:11.708
Hey! Welcome back!

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.792
Iruma, sir!
And Kiriwo, too!

00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:16.167
The launch pad is all ready!

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:18.500
[IRUMA] It's got your style
for sure, Clara.

00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:20.042
[CLARA]
Yeah! I worked so hard!

00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:21.750
[ASMODEUS]
I tried to stop her, but...

00:18:22.708 --> 00:18:24.042
[KIRIWO laughs]

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:26.458
I think it's just fine.
It looks sturdy enough.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.042
We're actually gonna

-[laughs]
-[KIRIWO] Iruma.

Let's do our best.

00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:36.833
Yeah!

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:39.125
[ASMODEUS/CLARA shouting]

00:18:40.542 --> 00:18:41.417
[NARRATOR]
And then...

00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:45.208
[BARAKI] Alright, everyone.
Tomorrow's the day!

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.500
The Battler Party
has finally arrived!

00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:49.792
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:51.417
Are y'all ready?!

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:53.583
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:18:55.292 --> 00:18:56.375
[NARRATOR]
Those who were excited

00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:58.042
about the festivities
beginning.

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:02.792
Those who were
anxiously waiting

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:04.042
to see the fireworks.

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:06.667
[ROBIN]
Acting Chair-Demon!

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:08.208
Relax! Just chill out.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.000
-Take it easy!
-[KALEGO grumbles]

00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:11.583
[NARRATOR] Those who were
becoming irritated

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:13.125
by their peers.

00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:17.375
My sweet Iruma.
[sobbing]

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:20.208
[NARRATOR] Those who were
still being interrogated.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.958
[CLARA]
Flowers! More flowers!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.583
[NARRATOR] Those who weren't
quite done decorating yet.

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.750
Flowers! Flowers!

[BOTH laughing]

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.083
[NARRATOR]
As the sun slowly set,

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:35.833
everyone had different things
on their minds.

00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:42.458
[ASMODEUS]
David.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.583
For the next three days,

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:44.917
I am going to be engaged
at school

00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:46.417
and won't be home.

00:19:46.458 --> 00:19:48.625
-Watch over the house.
-As you wish.

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:50.625
Uh, by the way,
Mister Alice,

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:52.333
I do have
a rather sudden message

00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:53.292
from your mother.

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:56.667
"I'm for sure coming to see
your Battler tomorrow!

00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:59.125
-Whee!" She says.
-[ASMODEUS screams]

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:00.583
D-David...

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.875
...do whatever you can
to stop her!

00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:05.250
[DAVID]
Aye, sir.

00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:07.625
[CLARA] Mommy, Keebow,
Konchie, little ones,

00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:11.125
they aren't here, but Daddy
and Urala, I'm out!

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:13.292
[BABIES]
Hey, hey!

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.667
Let go of me. Hey--

00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.708
You forgot something, honey.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.625
Enough snacks and toys
for three days.

00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:22.167
Mommy! Please get these
little tykes off me!

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:24.792
[CLARA'S MOM] They hate it
when their Sissy leaves,

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:26.500
because they miss her so!

00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:29.083
We'll all come support
you tomorrow,

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.667
so do your best, Clara.

00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:32.750
Roger that!

00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:36.292
[SABNOCK]
Hm?

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:38.125
Yo! How ya doin',
Big Brother?

-You good, you well?
-Mm.

Finally! Tomorrow's
the big party!

And FYI,
I'm definitely going!

00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:45.750
But the bad news is,
Father says

00:20:45.792 --> 00:20:47.708
he can't make it
because he has work.

-[growls]

Aah! Whatever.
Who cares?!

Easy! You almost gave me
a heart attack there!

00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:56.542
[IRUMA]
Hmm.

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:57.875
Let's see--

00:20:57.917 --> 00:20:59.500
If you're looking
for the chair-demon,

00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:00.792
he hasn't returned yet.

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.500
Oh. Hi, Opera!

00:21:02.542 --> 00:21:04.792
I, uh, I know I'm
a bit jumpy right now.

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:07.708
You know, it's a big event,
so I guess I must be nervous,

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:10.583
The chair-demon is,

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:13.333
well, he's carefree,
random, ridiculous,

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:15.833
doesn't read the room,
runs off without thinking,

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:19.292
he shirks the rules,
and can be a space case, but...

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.500
...he always holds true
to his word.

00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:27.875
Right!

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:30.667
Party! Party! Woo!

00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:32.333
We've come
to pick you up, Master.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:33.583
Are you ready to go?

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.125
I'll see you later.

00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:41.000
[NARRATOR] The biggest event
at the demon school Babyls,

00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:43.500
also known
as the Battler Party,

00:21:43.542 --> 00:21:44.958
is now kicking off,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.583
with its equally anticipated
Party Eve.

[KIRIWO giggles]

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.667

[laughing]

00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:03.958
[KIRIWO]
...Iruma.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:39.333
Su-ki, ma?

00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:43.125
[SULLIVAN] Geez, could we
wrap this up already?

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:46.000
You'll make me late
to Iruma's presentation!

00:23:46.042 --> 00:23:47.625
[OFFICER]
I'm so nervous!

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:49.667
Lord Sullivan is
right in front of me!

00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:51.667
[NARRATOR] It just so happens
that this interrogator

00:23:51.708 --> 00:23:54.583
is a huge fan of Sullivan,
one of the Three Greats,

00:23:54.625 --> 00:23:58.042
whom everyone thinks and hopes
will be the next Demon King.

00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:02.292
Okay! First question,
Wh-who was your first love?!

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:06.958
Aah! My stupid nerves made me
ask something ridiculous!

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.417
[SULLIVAN]
How much time you got?

00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:09.792
[OFFICER]
All the time in the world!

00:24:09.833 --> 00:24:11.542
[NARRATOR] Moments later,
this interrogator

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.458
was duly replaced.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.958
[KIRIWO] The day of
the Party Eve has come at last!

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.125
We could only create
these amazing fireworks

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:22.875
because of y'all's hard work.

00:24:22.917 --> 00:24:24.750
I have to thank you properly.

00:24:24.792 --> 00:24:27.875
I'm grateful that
I met you, Iruma. Truly.

Next time,

"Party Eve."

00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.708
Now, just like
I promised Big Bro,

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.625
I'm gonna destroy
the demon school Babyls.

00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:38.875
I'm sure it's gonna be
a blast.
