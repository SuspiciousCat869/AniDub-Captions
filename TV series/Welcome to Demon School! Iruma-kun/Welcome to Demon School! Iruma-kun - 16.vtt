Kiriwo, wait!

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:13.958
Huh?

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.958
About that Grand Prize.
Well, we should go for it!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.792
The grand, uh... what, now?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.125
Yeah, you've got pure,
true ambition.

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:30.917
I must say, you and I...

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:35.042
...we're so much alike,
it's almost scary.

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:40.375
[ASMODEUS]
Th-the Grand Prize?

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:42.875
[IRUMA]
Yeah. So I was wondering

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.792
if maybe
you'd both help out.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.375
[crying]

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:50.000
Uh, you okay?

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:51.833
But of course, sir!

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.708
I couldn't stand
that some snarky cretins

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.125
who can barely tie
their own shoes

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.250
had the colossal nerve
to call your Battler

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:58.375
"storage space!"

00:00:58.417 --> 00:00:59.500
Let us do this!

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:01.125
Sounds so fun!

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.750
Now let's go kablooey!
Yeah!

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.417
Aw, thanks, you guys!

[IRUMA/ASMODEUS/CLARA]
A very good morning to you!

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.625
Good morning, all.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.500
The time has finally come.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.042
Sure has!

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.333
Now, the Grand Prize!

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.208
We'll do whatever it takes
to get it!

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.375
-Right!
-Yeah!

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:24.292

[NARRATOR]
Iruma Suzuki, age fourteen.

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.042
One day, he found himself

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.000
the grandson of a demon
named Sullivan.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:36.375
Sullivan loves
and spoils Iruma

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:38.958
and is even sending him
to the most prestigious school

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.167
in the land.

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:42.292
But there is just one problem.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.083
The school Iruma is attending

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.875
just so happens to be

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:48.667
the demon school
known as Babyls.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.083
[IRUMA] I can't ever let them
find out I'm human,

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:53.083
or I'm gonna get eaten
for sure!

"Party Eve."

[BOY 1] Sweet apples!
Get your sweet apples, here!

We've got cotton candy!

-[BOY 2] Whoa! I caught it!
-[BOY 3] Wow! Nice job!

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:40.542
This is the official kickoff
of the long-awaited Party Eve

00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.542
of our school's biggest
and favorite event,

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:43.958
the Battler Party!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now let's all have a blast,
what do you say?!

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.333
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:50.417
And the Grand Prize
is up for grabs!

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:52.250
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:53.875
Oh wow.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.917
FYI, our show begins
after sundown.

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.667
We should scout
the other Battlers' booths

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:00.167
as we walk
around the venue.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:01.208
Good idea!

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.958
And we can wear
cool disguises!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.417
I have some
for all of you.

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:06.417
Are you a pink Come-Come?

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:08.208
Not exactly subtle!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.167
Come on,
put it on already.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.667
-Why bother even scouting, then?
-It'll be fine. Put them on.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.792
I must say,
that's fresh indeed.

00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:16.875
I have to go conserve
my energy,

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:19.542
so I'm leaving the scoutin'
to you guys, okay?

How about an ogre-sized
serving of yakisoba?

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.625
It's devi irresistible!

are going to take
the Grand Prize

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:36.583
with our special yakisoba.

so we get some challengers!

It'll bring your mouth
to its knees!

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.083
Try to eat all of it,
I dare you!

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:51.125

-Can I try that?

Oh, you think you can
handle that? Huh?

Master Iruma could eat
twice that amount

in the blink of an eye.

Hey, Sabnock.

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:39.375
Our Magical Apparatus Battler
is who will reign supreme!

It can slide.

The Party Eve is meant

00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:48.417
to be enjoyed, after all.

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:50.500
The instructors won't be judging
the Battlers

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:52.708
until the Party Day
tomorrow, anyway.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.792
The Party Eve is a festival
for students to have fun

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:58.375
and ease into preparation
for tomorrow.

00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:01.542
So what are you planning to do
for the Party Day, Sabnock?

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:04.208
Ah. An outstanding query.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.250
I shall perform an action scene
about the Demon King!

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:10.125
We're enacting an anecdote
about a former Demon King!

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:13.125
It'll be a massacre that
will get your blood boiling!

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:15.792
And, of course, I am playing
the Demon King!

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:18.833
[CLARA] Woo-hoo!
Great casting! [giggles]

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:22.000
What?! Master Iruma is far
better suited for that role!

We were all wandering,

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:49.958
and somehow we bumped
into each other.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.125
[LEAD/SCHNEIDER/GOEMON/PICERO]
Somehow.

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:52.333
It wasn't merely somehow,

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:53.583
I believe it was fate!

I love you.

As they say,

I eat, therefore I am.

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:22.083
Which Battler did you decide
to join, Jazz?

The New Magic Battler.

Just as the name says,

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958
we're creating
all new magic

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.458

completely new as well.

it's gonna be awesome.

to let you experience

a game hands-on

a virtual sorcerer's hat

and go on a quest!

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.875
[IRUMA] That sounds fun!
I wanna try!

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:05.333
But if you get too into it,
there'll be no coming back!

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:06.417
What?

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:08.250
Ah, dreams are better anyway.

Can I explore an island

where beautiful women
will lust after me?

-Nope, sorry.
-Aah!

Why don't the three of us
make our debut together?

00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:27.958
What?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.833
No way,
I couldn't possibly.

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:32.875
Some of the other things
to look out for

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:35.708
are the splendid
underwater circus

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.500
and the Magic Beast battles.

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:38.875
[IRUMA]
Whoa.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.333
Every Battler this year

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:41.542
seems to have brought
their work

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:42.917
to a whole new level.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.708
We're up against these guys?

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.667
Oh yeah! We're gonna go
kablooey and then--

00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:50.333
Hey, that's a secret!

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:51.917
-[grunts]
-[GORGON SNAKE chomps]

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.833
[CLARA giggling]

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:55.542
We're up so high!

00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:57.917
[IRUMA]
Clara! Are you okay?!

00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.458
Anyway, you're really gonna
have to stand out

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.667
to get the Grand Prize.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.708
[gasps]

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:04.708
[firework whistling]

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.833
[firework explodes]

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.958
[IRUMA]
We totally have a chance!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.458
Why are you smirking
like that?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.167
Huh? Well...

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.125
[nervous laughter]

00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:16.917
[indistinct chatter]

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.833
[ASMODEUS] We,
the Magical Apparatus Battler,

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.167
will get the Grand Prize.

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:22.625
Now let us be off!

00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:24.042
Come on, let's go!

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.667
Yeah, wait up, you guys!
See you later.

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:28.292
Indeed.

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.875
-Iruma!
-Huh?

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.292
I'm still the one who'll take
the Grand Prize,

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:36.042
but I look forward
to your Battler's presentation.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.542
Yeah! You should!

00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:39.583
Yes.

00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:44.167
Now, let's review the plan
one more time

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.167
before Kiriwo returns.

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:48.542
It's "Strike Fast
for Certain Victory."

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:50.542
-Strike Fast.
-Certain Party.

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:51.792
Victory!

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.083
[clear throat]

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.583
Our opportune moment comes

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:56.292
at Party Day countdown.

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.000
After the Party Eve,

00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:59.958
all students gather
in the central plaza

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.292
to hear the bell mark
the start of Party Day.

00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:04.750
[bell tolls]

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:07.333
The minute that bell
stops ringing...

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:10.083
[firework whistling]

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:11.167
[firework explodes]

00:10:12.542 --> 00:10:15.917
We'll set the fireworks off,
stealing everyone's attention.

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.500
We will begin the show
with a great, big bang

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:22.042
and then follow up with
the smaller, pretty fireworks

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:24.000
in an orderly fashion
so we can get,

00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:26.042
and keep,
everyone's attention.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.292
Done.

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:29.042
That is the basic summation.

00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:30.500
-Ohh!
-[IRUMA laughs]

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.125
Strike first, strike fast!

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:33.792
-Yay for party!
-Wrong!

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:34.708
[clears throat]

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:38.333
It's a bit far from our
location to the central plaza,

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:40.542
but it'll be nighttime,
so the lights and sound

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:41.917
should be enough
to hook them in.

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.167
Ooh, me. Me!

00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.500
I wanna shoot
the fireworks off, can I?!

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:48.417
Only Master Iruma
is qualified

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:51.125
and worthy of handling
such a crucial task!

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:53.208
Aw, you're such a meanie!
Boo, boo!

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.333
That's alright,
Clara can do it.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:56.500
What are you saying?

00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:57.833
You're the only one
for the job,

00:10:57.875 --> 00:10:58.917
Iruma, sir!

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.458
If you say so.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.292
[ASMODEUS]
Its construction is flawless.

00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:04.917
It's programmed to fire
the rockets exactly ten seconds

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.875
after the fuse is lit.

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.792
I will provide
the official flame to start...

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.375
-[flame whooshing]
-...and then, Master,

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:13.167
you can light the fuse!

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:15.833
-[CLARA] Like this?
-Yes, exactly! Just like--

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:16.958
Hmm? Aah!

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.958
[giggles]
It's lit.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.708
[IRUMA/ASMODEUS]
Huhhh?!

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.333
-[BOTH scream]
-Put it out! Quickly now!

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:26.750
[grunting]

00:11:26.792 --> 00:11:29.208
-It won't go out!
-Get down!

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.458
[ALL grunt]

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:35.250
[smoke hissing]

00:11:35.292 --> 00:11:36.958
Huh? Misfire?

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:41.417
Huhh! Thank goodness
for that.

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:44.167
I truly feared
the worst had happened.

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:46.667
Hey! Wait,
did I do something wrong?

00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:48.708
You did everything wrong!

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.458
We were supposed to wait
until the Party Day begins!

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.708
I just finished
explaining that!

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.167
[frustrated grunt]

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:57.125
-Oh, yeah!
-[IRUMA/ASMODEUS groan]

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:58.667
Don't "oh yeah" me!

00:11:58.708 --> 00:11:59.792
I'm so sorry!

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:01.500
-Not good enough!
-Now, now.

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:04.292
You should've let us know
the shell wasn't in there!

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:07.417
Huh? Well, I don't know
anything about that.

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:10.625
But we obviously put
the shell in there, right?

00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:13.792
Yeah, where could the shell
have gone, though?

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:17.958
[grunts]

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.042
Oh boy.
[sighs]

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:22.583
I can't believe how heavy
this thing is.

00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:24.500
I can barely even stand.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:28.000
Now, then...

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.750
...it's time to kick off
our last party.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.750
[SULLIVAN] Are we still dragging
this interrogation out, boys?

00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:02.417
[OFFICER]
Investigations involving humans

00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:03.917
can get quite complex.

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.583
It'll take a while,
I'm afraid.

00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:09.208
I see.
In that case, check!

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.917
-Huh?
-[crying]

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.875
-Yay! Too bad I win!
-I lost again!

00:13:14.917 --> 00:13:16.208
Please! One more time!

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.792
Just one more game!
Please, come on!

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:20.125
I promise this will be
the last game! Oh, come on--

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:21.458
Honestly.

00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:24.958
He seems like
a peaceful fellow, but...

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:28.292
...according to our intel,

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:30.542
he illegally entered
the human world

00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:32.417
and is holding
a human teenager

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:33.833
against his will.

00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.292
Is this correct, Baal?

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:38.833
Who can say?

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.667
Baal.

00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:43.042
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.333
That's the story
my trusty little birdie told me,

00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:47.083
and I'm sticking to it.

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:49.333
Besides, you have
your own intel, right?

00:13:51.917 --> 00:13:54.792
That's why you've got all
these guards hanging around.

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:58.333
What is this, anyway,
your own personal goon squad?

00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:02.333
[ALL grumbling]

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:05.208
They're here in case
he tries to escape.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.458
We need to have
all relevant parties here

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.458
until his name is cleared.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.792
Although, I agree
it's rather rude

00:14:11.833 --> 00:14:14.458
to keep Lord Sullivan here
for too long.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.625
So, then, what to do,
I wonder.

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:19.708
Might as well take
your time.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.167
If this comes to nothing,
all the better.

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:26.750
Though, if I'm being
totally frank with you,

00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:28.917
this might very well be
what some call

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.708
the calm before the storm.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.000
[AMERI]
Where the devil did Iruma go?

00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:39.583
It's already sundown.

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:42.667
I hope he's actually prepared
for his big surprise.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:46.958
[giggles]

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.458
I'm finally going to see
that scene

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.750
from the forbidden texts
in real life.

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:53.458
We've now patrolled
this area extensively.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.708
Uh, yes, very good!

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.458
You seem distressed, Boss.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.083
Is there something
bothering you?

00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:00.750
No! I'm fine!

00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:02.292
There's nothing wrong.

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.583
But given how exposed
these kinds of events are,

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.708
trouble could be just
around the corner.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.250
Let's all be
on our guard.

00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:09.875
Understood.

00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:12.125
You scared me
a little bit, there.

00:15:12.167 --> 00:15:13.750
If you get it, let's go.

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:15.042
[ALL]
Yes, boss!

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:19.125
[AMERI]
Honestly, this is so silly.

00:15:19.167 --> 00:15:20.750
What am I even doing?!

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:23.208
I need to focus
on my duties more.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.542
And, Iruma,
you should do the same.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.292
[EIKO]
Want to go here next?

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:29.417
It says we can interact

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:31.292
with some friendly
Magic Beasts.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:33.667
[GAAKO] Ew, I don't like
Magic Beasts.

00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:36.375
They're sorta smelly
and might bite you.

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.583
[slurping]

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.917
[EIKO] Hey, you think Iruma
might like Magic Beasts?

00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.875
Um, I think most boys do,
actually.

00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:47.625
So you're saying we could
probably run into him there!

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:48.833
Oh yay!

00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:50.542
Where'd Kiriwo go?

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:52.083
We need to find him soon!

00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:54.167
Iruma, sir!

00:15:55.542 --> 00:15:57.417
