I BARELY SLEPT A WINK
LAST NIGHT.

18
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,625
NO EIGHT-SIX.
MAN, THIS IS WEIRD.

19
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,416
FEELS LIKE I'VE LOST
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,916
LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER'S DIED.

21
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,250
- ( bell tolling )

22
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,208
- ( grunts )

23
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,500
- YOU LOOK LIKE THE WALKING DEAD
AS USUAL MY FRIEND.

24
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,458
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

25
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,416
- COME ON.
IT IS WAY TOO EARLY

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,666
FOR YOU TO BE ACTING
LIKE A HYPERACTIVE FREAK.

27
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,041
WHY ARE YOU SO
WORKED UP ANYWAY?

28
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,375
- WHY ELSE WOULD I BE?

29
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,125
TODAY'S THE DAY OF THE BIG RACE.

30
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,291
THE RED SUNS AND THE EMPERORS
ARE GONNA GO TOE TO TOE!

31
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,833
I'M ALREADY SO FREAKING EXCITED,

32
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,083
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
EVEN TAKE A LEAK?

33
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,958
I KNOW. WHY DON'T WE CARPOOL UP
THERE LIKE THE TWO OF US DID

34
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,041
THAT TIME WE WENT UP
TO RACE IN MYOGI.

35
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,750
AND CAN WE TAKE YOUR EIGHT-SIX?

36
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,375
MAYBE SHOW IT OFF?
TO THE ADORING FANS?

37
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,666
UH...

38
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,583
DO YOU HAVE WAX IN YOUR EARS
OR SOMETHING?

39
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,458
I SAID, WHY DON'T WE TAKE
YOUR EIGHT-SIX UP THERE?

40
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,541
HOLD UP! TAKUMI,
WHERE YOU GOING, MAN!

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,500
I CAN'T WAIT TO CHECK
THIS RACE OUT TONIGHT.

42
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,625
IT'S GONNA BE A HELLUVA TIME.
ANY THOUGHTS ON WHO'S GONNA WIN?

43
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,375
'CAUSE I THINK IT'S
GONNA BE RYOSUKE.

44
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,791
HE'S CLEARLY THE BETTER DRIVER
OF THE TWO.

45
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,000
THAT SUDO GUY FROM
THE EMPERORS ISN'T THAT GOOD.

46
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,791
FORGET WHAT I THINK
ABOUT HIM PERSONALLY.

47
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,583
HE JUST HAPPENS TO
DRIVE A BETTER CAR.

48
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,166
- YOU KNOW WHAT, DUDE.
YOU DON'T KNOW CRAP ABOUT CARS.

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,916
SO JUST SHUT UP, ALRIGHT?

50
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,750
- WHAT ARE YOU SO
PISSED OFF ABOUT?

51
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,666
- LOOK, MAN. IT'S NOT THAT
I'M MAD OR ANYTHING.

52
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,875
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETHING CAME UP
WITH THE CAR

53
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,208
SO I CAN'T GO WITH YOU
TO WATCH THE RACE TONIGHT.

54
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,666
- HUH, WHY NOT?

55
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,916
- I JUST CAN'T.
GO WITH IKETANI AND KENJI, OKAY?

56
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,833
YOU'LL BE FINE.

57
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,916
- WHAT THE HELL?
TAKUMI ACTUALLY LOST?

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.

59
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,791
- SO, HE REALLY DID GO
TO AKAGI LAST NIGHT.

60
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,291
THAT'S JUST PERFECT.

61
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,458
I HEARD SOMETHIN' ABOUT HIS CAR
STOPPING DURING THE RACE.

62
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,041
I WAS HOPING IT WAS JUST RUMOR,
BUT I GUESS IT'S 'NOT.

63
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT STOPPED?

64
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,750
DID HE BLOW THE ENGINE

65
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,250
OR DID HE SLAM IT INTO A
GUARDRAIL OR WHAT?

66
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,958
- NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

67
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,708
WE'RE JUST HEARING
BITS AND PIECES.

68
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,666
WE'RE BASICALLY PANICKING OVER
EVERY LITTLE THING WE HEAR.

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,291
- WELL, BOSS,
WE ACTUALLY FIGURED

70
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,833
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD SOMETHIN'
ABOUT IT FROM HIS DAD.

71
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,750
THE TWO OF YOU BEING
OLD FRIENDS AND ALL.

72
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,583
- SORRY, GUYS, BUT THIS IS THE
FIRST I'M HEARING ABOUT IT.

73
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,708
HANG ON. I'M GONNA GIVE HIM
A CALL REAL QUICK.

74
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,875
- ( phone ringing )

75
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,625
- ( ringing continues )

76
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,041
- HE'S NOT ANSWERING.
DAMN THE LUCK.

77
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,958
TAKUMI'S PROBABLY AT SCHOOL
RIGHT NOW ANYWAY.

78
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,208
IT'S BUGGING THE HELL OUT OF ME
THAT THEY NEVER EVEN BOTHERED

79
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,458
TO TELL US ABOUT THIS.

80
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,750
- ( car approaching )

81
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,416
- LOOK.
THAT'S KEISUKE TAKAHASHI.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,375
- IS TAKUMI HERE?

83
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,916
- NO. TODAY'S HIS DAY OFF.
HE'S BACK ON SHIFT TOMORROW.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,583
- ALRIGHT. I WAS HOPING TO
TALK TO HIM DIRECTLY.

85
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,625
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE A MESSAGE
WITH YOU GUYS.

86
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,500
BUT IT'S LOOKING LIKE THAT'S
WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO.

87
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,875
TELL HIM I SAID LAST NIGHT'S
RACE DOESN'T COUNT.

88
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,250
THAT I WON'T ACCEPT THE WIN.

89
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,750
IT WAS TOO STRANGE TO
COUNT FOR ANYTHING.

90
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,708
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

91
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,208
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR ME.

92
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,250
THING IS, I JUST CAN'T STAND UP
AND SAY TAKUMI FUJUWARA

93
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,958
WAS DEFEATED LAST NIGHT.

94
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,000
AND ONE MORE THING.

95
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,250
HE NEEDS TO KNOW.

96
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,166
WE'RE ALL PLANNING TO
AVENGE HIS EIGHT-SIX.

97
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,166
SHOW THE EMPERORS WHO'S BOSS.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

98
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,625
WE ARE GONNA WIPE THE PAVEMENT
WITH THOSE WANNABES. LATER.

99
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,750
- HOLD UP!
WE'LL GIVE HIM THE MESSAGE.

100
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,250
AND I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
GOOD LUCK WITH TONIGHT'S BATTLE.

101
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,083
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE
PULLING FOR YOU, MAN.

102
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,166
- ( engine accelerating )

103
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,791
- ( crashing )

104
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,125
- ( tires screeching )

105
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,583
- ( thudding )

106
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,500
- ( screaming )

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,291
- ( crashing )

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,916
- ( whimpering ) BAD IDEA!

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,625
- Takumi: WHAT THE HELL?

110
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,333
ARE YOU NUTS?

111
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,791
YOU THINK MAYBE THIS
ROCK'S A LITTLE TOO BIG

112
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,958
TO BE THROWIN' AT MY WINDOW?

113
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,708
YOU COULD'VE SHATTERED THE THING

114
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,750
OR GIVEN ME A CONCUSSION
FOR THAT MATTER.

115
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,166
- I LOOKED FOR SMALLER ONES,
BUT 'THERE WEREN'T ANY.

116
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,208
BESIDES IT ISN'T LIKE YOU
GOT HURT OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

117
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,791
AND I MADE SURE TO
THROW IT LIGHTLY.

118
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,666
I WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY
AWESOME IN BASEBALL.

119
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,041
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD
YOU THINK YOU WERE.

120
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,000
YOU DON'T THROW FREAKIN'
BOULDERS AT MY WINDOW.

121
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,416
- ( screaming )

122
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,750
- I AM SO SORRY!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT YOUR CAR!

123
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:34,333
- ( sobbing ) I DON'T DESERVE
NICE THINGS ANYWAY!

124
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,333
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU THAT
I WASN'T GONNA GO WITH YOU

125
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,708
TO AKAGI TODAY.

126
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,916
- I KNOW. AND I DECIDED THAT
I'M NOT GONNA GO EITHER.

127
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,875
INSTEAD OF THAT, WHY DON'T
YOU AND I GO ON UP TO AKINA PASS

128
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,416
FOR A LITTLE JOY RIDE.

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,041
WHATTYA SAY?
COULD BE SOME FUN.

130
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,083
- HEY. TAKUMI?
ONE THING.

131
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,208
I JUST WANNA SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

132
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,541
I 'KNOW I HAVE A KILLER ARM,

133
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,500
BUT THE ROCK WAS BIGGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

134
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,750
- DUDE, I DON'T
CARE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

135
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,833
I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE IF YOU'D
MAYBE HEARD ANYTHING

136
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,708
ABOUT LAST NIGHT'S RACE THOUGH.

137
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,750
- YEAH. IKETANI FILLED ME IN
ON IT AFTER SCHOOL.

138
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,166
- SO I GUESS EVERYONE AT THE
STATION ALREADY KNOWS, TOO.

139
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,541
- SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IN TOWN
IS ALREADY TALKIN' ABOUT IT.

140
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,625
IT'S PRETTY BIG NEWS.

141
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,750
THEY ALL KEEP THEIR EYES ON YOU.

142
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,666
BY THE WAY, IKETANI SAID
HE HAD A MESSAGE

143
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,291
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE TO
YOU WHEN I SAW YOU.

144
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:55,083
- WHAT THE HECK? GOT SOME
DUDE RIDIN' RIGHT UP ON MY TAIL.

145
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,750
- WELL, HE'S PROBABLY JUST AS
EXCITED TO GET UP THERE

146
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,500
AND SEE TONIGHT'S
RACE AS WE ARE.

147
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,500
- YEAH, SURE, MAN. I GUESS SO.

148
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,625
BUT THE GUY'S JUST RUBBING ON
MY NERVES A LITTLE BIT,

149
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,583
LOOK AT HOW DAMN CLOSE HE'S
RIDING TO MY FREAKING BUMPER.

150
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,291
I'LL JUST SPEED UP.

151
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,000
- NAH, LOOKS LIKE
HE'S TRYING TO PASS.

152
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,750
PULL OVER SOME AND
LET HIM GET BY.

153
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,125
- YEAH. LET'S SEE WHAT
KINDA CAR HE'S 'DRIVING.

154
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,833
- DUDE THAT'S A FREAKIN'
EIGHT-SIX LEVIN!

155
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,416
- AND IT'S GOT A TURBO!

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
I COULD HEAR THE WASTE GATE PASS
THE EXHAUST OUT THE TAILPIPE!

157
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,291
DAMN, THAT GUY FLEW BY
MY SR-TWENTY TURBO

158
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,916
LIKE I WAS PARKED IN
A DRIVE-THROUGH.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,041
HOW'D HE DO THAT?
I MEAN, WERE ON AN UPHILL!

160
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,958
- WHERE DID THAT GUY COME FROM?

161
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,416
HAVE I EVER EVEN SEEN HIM
AROUND HERE BEFORE?

162
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,958
- Itsuki: THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.

163
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,291
KEISUKE CAME TO THE GAS STATION

164
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,958
AND SAID AS FAR AS
HE WAS CONCERNED,

165
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,083
HE DOESN'T THINK YOU LOST
LAST NIGHT'S RACE.

166
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,916
- I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE MEANS.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,458
I MEAN I DID LOSE.
I WAS COMPLETELY OUTMATCHED.

168
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,583
IF YOU'D SEEN IT, YOU'D AGREE...

169
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,333
- SO SUDO WAS THAT GOOD, HUH?

170
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,791
THOSE EMPEROR'S KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING.

171
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,125
- YEAH, THEY DO.

172
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,083
I WOULD'VE LOST TO THEM
EVEN IF WE RACED IN AKINA.

173
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,541
- Itsuki: MAKES SENSE.

174
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,791
- SO DUDE, HOW IS THE
OLD EIGHT-SIX, ANYWAY?

175
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,750
CAN YOU FIX HER UP?

176
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,541
- MY DAD THINKS SHE
NEEDS A NEW ENGINE,

177
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,375
BUT I DUNNO, MAYBE IT DOES.

178
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,541
- ( gasps )

179
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,458
- I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
GONE TO AKAGI.

180
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,708
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

181
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,791
ONE I'LL PROBABLY REGRET
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

182
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,750
- ( people chattering )

183
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,708
- DAMN, THE AIR'S SO TENSE
AROUND HERE, YOU COULD PUNCH IT.

184
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,916
- YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT CRAZY RACE
WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT?

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,458
- YEAH. AKINA'S EIGHT-SIX LOST.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

186
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,708
BUT SUDO'S TECHNIQUE IS
NOTHING TO SCOFF AT.

187
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,750
I HEAR IT'S FREAKIN'
OUT OF THIS 'WORLD.

188
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,875
- I GUESS
RYOSUKE TAKAHASHI REALLY IS

189
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,291
GOONMA'S ONE LAST
HOPE OF REDEMPTION.

190
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,458
I WANT THAT GUY TO WIN
NO MATTER WHAT.

191
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,291
- Takeshi: SHINGO, YOU CAME TO
SEE THIS THING PLAY OUT, TOO?

192
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,958
- TAKESHI.

193
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,166
I FIGURED COMING OUT AND
ROOTING FOR THE RED SUNS

194
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,916
IS THE LEAST I CAN DO.

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,708
- THERE'S NOT A CHANCE IN HELL
RYOSUKE'S GONNA LOSE THIS ONE.

196
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,833
WE CAN'T JUST LET THESE LAN-EVO
IDIOTS LOOK DOWN ON GOONMA

197
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,125
FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY.

198
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,208
- YEAH.

199
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,500
LOOK AT HOW CLOSE YOU ARE.

200
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,916
WHATTYA SAY YOU BACK
THE HELL UP A BIT?

201
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,041
- ( tires screeching )

202
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,416
- WOAH. DUDE, AN EIGHT-SIX!

203
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,083
- WAIT, IS THAT AKINA'S
EIGHT-SIX?

204
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,125
- NO, IT'S GOT SAITAMA PLATES.

205
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,208
- WHATTYA THINK?
THIS GONNA WORK, KAZUMI?

206
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,833
- IT'S FINE.

207
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,083
- ( crowd gasping )

208
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,583
- THERE THEY ARE.
IT'S THE LAN-EVO'S.

209
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,125
- COME ON, RED SUNS!
YOU CAN DO IT!

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,750
- GOT ANYTHING TO SAY BEFORE
WE CRANK THIS UP, RYOSUKE?

211
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,958
- NOT REALLY.

212
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,750
JUST THAT IT'S ONLY GONNA BE
YOU AND ME OUT THERE TONIGHT.

213
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,041
- ( scoffs )
YEAH, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

214
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,750
NOW WHATTYA SAY YOU AND I
START A REAL RACE, HUH?

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,125
- INITIAL D.

216
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,958
- INITIAL D.

217
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,791
- REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD ME
YOU WEREN'T GONNA RACE

218
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,208
IN AKINA ANYMORE?

219
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,583
MAN, WHEN I HEARD THAT,

220
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,583
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE
BRAVEST DRIVER I'D EVER MET.

221
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,041
AND I REALLY MEAN THAT.

222
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,125
YOU WANTING' TO RACE ANYPLACE

223
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,250
BUT AT HOME IMPRESSED
ME, BIG TIME.

224
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,083
- LOOK MAN, YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

225
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,541
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING IMPRESSIVE
ABOUT WHAT WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT.

226
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,875
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT WAS AWFUL
AND 'WHEN IT WAS OVER,

227
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,833
I WAS MADDER
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

228
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,791
BECAUSE OF THAT, I STARTED
MAKING REALLY STUPID DECISIONS.

229
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,708
I COULDN'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS
AND I ENDED UP WRECKING THE CAR.

230
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,833
SERVES ME RIGHT, I GUESS.

231
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,708
I WAS SO PISSED OFF
I COULDN'T SEE STRAIGHT.

232
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,166
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS
BEING BEHIND THE WHEEL.

233
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,250
I'M JUST LUCKY I WALKED AWAY
IN ONE PIECE.

234
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,541
I CAN ACCEPT THE LOSS,
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN

235
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,958
I KNOW I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

236
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,375
WHAT I CAN'T GET
OVER IS THE FACT

237
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,166
MY EIGHT-SIX
ENDED UP TRASHED.

238
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,291
AND MY DAD, HE TRUSTED ME.

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,583
SORRY, DUDE.

240
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,250
- ( engines revving )

241
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,458
- THIS IS IT. SO WHAT PLAN
ARE YOU RUNNIN' WITH?

242
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,250
- SIMULATION X.

243
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,833
- SERIOUSLY?
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE HAD AN X.

244
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,750
- RYOSUKE IS AN EXCEPTION TO
ALL OF OUR OTHER RULES.

245
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,791
AND I DEVELOPED A SPECIAL
STRATEGY JUST FOR THIS BATTLE.

246
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,916
IT'S ONE THAT'S GONNA WIN THIS
THING FOR ME. COUNT ON IT.

247
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,125
- EYES FRONT!
I'M STARTIN' THE COUNTDOWN!

248
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,291
FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE. GO!

249
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,625
- ( tires screeching )

250
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,750
- AS LONG AS MY BROTHER
RUNS HIS NORMAL RACE,

251
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,083
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL LOSE
TO THAT LAN-EVO.

252
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,208
- ♪ I WONDER WHAT YOU DO,

259
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,791
- RYOSUKE CORNERS SHARPER THAN
ANYONE ELSE ON THE CIRCUIT!

260
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,125
- WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

261
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,083
I'VE SEEN RYOSUKE RACE
DOZENS OF TIMES

262
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,041
AND HE USUALLY LETS HIS
OPPONENT TAKE THE LEAD.

263
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,083
WONDER WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT?

264
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,500
- THIS IS AWESOME!

265
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,083
I MEAN, BOTH OF THOSE CARS
ARE SO INTENSE OUT THERE!

266
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT SIS,
IT IS A PRETTY AWESOME RACE.

267
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,041
BUT HEY, ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE
ALL OF THE LITTLE SUBTLETIES

268
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,916
IN THEIR STRATEGIES?

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,208
LIKE THAT THE EVO THREE
HAD A QUICK START

270
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,500
BUT IT NEVER FULLY ACCELERATED
COMING OFF THE LINE.

271
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,083
AND WHEN THEY DOVE INTO THE
FIRST CORNER ALL TANGLED UP,

272
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,583
IF YOU WATCHED CLOSELY YOU COULD
SEE HE RETREATED A LITTLE BIT.

273
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,750
THAT KINDA THING'S OUT OF FORM,
FOR HIM.

274
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,333
- OH.

275
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,458
- MAYBE HE WAS CHOOSING TO STAY
BEHIND AS SOME KIND OF STRATEGY.

276
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,125
THERE'S REALLY
NO WAY OF KNOWING.

277
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,000
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IT
WAS WORTH COMING OUT

278
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,791
TO SEE THIS RACE.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,208
- ( tires screeching )

280
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,125
- I CAN DO THIS.
THIS IS A RACE I CAN WIN.

281
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,333
BY HANGIN' BACK, I CAN
SEE EVERYTHING

282
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,416
THAT RYOSUKE IS TRYING TO DO.

283
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,583
I'VE GOT THIS GUY.

284
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,750
ALL OF THE UNCERTAINTIES
THAT HAVE BEEN SWIRLING

285
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,125
AROUND IN MY HEAD,

286
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,625
THEY'RE GONE.

287
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,958
- ( tires screeching )

288
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,208
- I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN, RYOSUKE,

289
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,666
WHAT YOU TOLD ME A YEAR AGO,

290
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,666
AFTER I LOST TO YOU.

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,750
- Kyoichi: DON'T LET THIS GO
TO YOUR HEAD, MAN.

292
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,583
I STILL THINK YOU STREET RACERS
ARE THE LOWEST OF THE LOW.

293
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:49,250
THE BEST ANY OF YOU COULD HOPE
TO BE IS MEDIOCRE.

294
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,875
THERE'S NO WAY THE MOTOR
SPORT TECHNIQUE IS INFERIOR

295
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,666
TO PRIMITIVE STREET TECHNIQUE.

296
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,208
IT WAS DEVELOPED TO
ACHIEVE MAXIMUM SPEED!

297
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,708
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT!

298
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,333
GOT THAT? THAT'S WHAT
I'M ALWAYS GONNA THINK.

299
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,666
- BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT,

300
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,458
BUT THE MOUNTAIN PASS REQUIRES
ITS OWN TECHNIQUE.

301
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,333
YOU WON'T SUCCEED UP THERE
WITH WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED SO FAR.

302
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,000
THAT STUFF YOU PICKED
UP AT GYMKHANA

303
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,875
AND THOSE OTHER CIRCUITS.

304
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,083
- THAT'S TOTAL BS.
NO FREAKIN' WAY!

305
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,458
- KYOICHI!

306
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,458
I'M GETTING THE FEELING
THAT THIS CONVERSATION

307
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,916
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

308
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
AT LEAST NOT ANYWHERE
THAT'S GOING TO RESULT

309
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,333
IN ANY ANSWERS FOR YOU.

310
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,166
BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOUR THEORY IS CORRECT,

311
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,708
THEN GO AHEAD AND DEFEAT ME.

312
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,833
BUT IF YOU CAN'T BEAT ME,

313
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,000
THEN ALL YOU'RE LEFT
WITH IS A THEORY.

314
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,291
- ( scoffs )
I WON'T FORGET THIS, RYOSUKE.

315
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,583
I WILL DEFEAT YOU SOMEDAY.

316
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,791
THEN YOU'LL TASTE THE SAME
BITTER ANGUISH THAT I DO.

317
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,958
AND I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
IT SINCE THEN.

318
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,375
I KNOW YOU REMEMBER, TOO.

319
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,500
ALL OF OUR RACING THEORIES
AND PERSONAL BELIEFS,

320
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,583
THEY'RE ALL RIDING ON
OUR TIRES TONIGHT, PAL.

321
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,708
- ( tires screeching )

322
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,166
RYOSUKE, YOU TOLD ME
THE MOUNTAIN PASS

323
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,791
REQUIRES ITS OWN TECHNIQUE.

324
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,375
THE BOLDNESS TO TAKE
THE SHORTEST LINE.

325
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,000
HEEL AND TOE,

326
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,250
THE ALL-WHEEL DRIFT WITH
ZERO COUNTER-STEERING.

327
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,750
YOU MAY BE FAST OUT HERE,

328
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,166
BUT WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT YOUR TECHNIQUE?

329
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,291
YOU'RE JUST SPITTIN' OUT

330
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,458
TEXTBOOK CIRCUIT
RACING BULLCRAP!

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,375
IF YOU WANT SPEED, YOU'LL END UP
HAVING TO RELY ON

332
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,125
MOTOR SPORT TECHNIQUE!

333
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,458
MY THEORY IS THE RIGHT ONE!

334
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,625
- ( tires screeching )

335
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,708
RYOSUKE'S FC IS KICKIN'
DOWN THE PASS!

336
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,250
IT'S LIKE A DAMN JET ENGINE!

337
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,583
THE EVO THREE IS RIGHT
THERE ALONG WITH HIM!

338
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,291
- ( engines accelerating )

339
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,416
- HERE THEY COME.
WONDER WHO'S IN FRONT.

340
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,458
- THIS PART ALWAYS
MAKES ME NERVOUS.

341
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,583
- CHECK IT OUT, GUYS!
IT'S THE FC!

342
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,791
- I'LL SHOW YOU JUST
HOW MUCH I'VE GROWN

343
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,833
SINCE I FACED YOU
LAST YEAR, RYOSUKE!

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,208
- ( crowd cheering )

345
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,875
THIS IS WHERE MY
FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

346
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,916
AND THE MISFIRING SYSTEM
REALLY KNOCK IT OUT!

347
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,125
- WHAT? THE EVO THREE
JUST PASSED RYOSUKE'S FC!

348
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
- ( theme song playing )

349
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

350
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,750
- Announcer: WHAT? THE EIGHT-SIX
WAS SEEN IN AKINA!.

351
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,958
SO IT'S RUNNING AGAIN!

352
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,833
NEXT ON INITIAL D SECOND STAGE.

353
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,041
"DANGEROUS CAR."
DON'T MISS IT!
